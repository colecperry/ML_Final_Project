this might be a record for the fastest death of a republican scandal. trump and republicans made a number of assumptions that turned out not to be true. it looks like the fbi is only trying to be careful in their review. since the emails have nothing to do with hillary clinton, the state department, emails sent or received by clinton or the clinton foundation, republicans were wrong on all fronts. 
facts wont stop republicans from trying to make something out of nothing, but the comey letter is not the campaign changer that trump and the republicans were hoping for. the weakness of this story means that should play well in the conservative media echo chamber, but by monday, it will be forgotten by the rest of the country.",133,736265,real
"the great move of china 2020 is underway the great move of china 2020 is underway october 31, 2016 the great move of china 2020 is underway 
china will invest 946.3 billion yuan 140 billion by 2020 to relocate its poorest citizens from remote, inland regions to more developed areas, the state planner said on monday. 
the mass relocation is part of a strategy to lift 10 million people out of poverty by 2020, with 2 million estimated to be moved this year, the state council said in may. 
the funds will be used mainly to construct homes, support facilities and basic public infrastructure, with the rest going to the restoration of vacated lands, state planner national development and reform commision ndrc said in a document.

the investment will be financed mainly by china's two policy banks - china development bank and agricultural development bank of china, who will provide 341.3 billion yuan in long-term loans and 50 billion yuan in construction bonds - as well as by local governments, who will provide 285.8 billion yuan. 
local governments will also raise up to 100 billion yuan through bonds, while the central government in beijing will allocate around 80 billion yuan. relocated villagers are expected to contribute 21.5 billion yuan. 
china's poor make up about 5 percent of a population of 1.4 billion, living mostly in the countryside and earning less than 2,300 yuan a year, according to the government and state media. 
more than 12 million people were moved in earlier relocation efforts as of the end of last year, the ndrc said. article by doc burkhart , vice-president, general manager and co-host of trunews with rick wiles got a news tip? email us at help support the ministry of trunews with your one-time or monthly gift of financial support. donate now ! download the trunews mobile app! click here! donate today! support trunews to help build a global news network that provides a credible source for world news

the recent wikileaks revelations about the clintons, the clinton campaign, media collusion, and the various hypocrisies of the democratic party are groundbreaking in both their scope and depth. 
the sheer number of hacked emails covering so many topics, combined with the shadiness of the activities involved, should have already handed donald trump the election. 
alas, the media, whose collusion with the clinton campaign is laid out in many of the emails, will not have a bar of reporting them in a professional, ethical fashion. the following seven email exchanges have either been deliberately suppressed by mainstream outlets or given the slimmest coverage to feebly ward off accusations that they are in the de facto service or pocket of hillary clinton.

"bernie sanders rises in the senate, prepares to become trumps worst nightmare tweets  addicting info  the knowledge you crave on november 16, 2016 456 pm  
it was just a few days ago that bernie sanders responded to trumps election win with the perfect message from democrats. he said  
if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims, hispanics, african americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare. 
and from what was just announced, it seems that sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. earlier today, the vermont senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door senate democrat caucus meeting, according to the hill . in his new role, sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters  the very voters who became trump supporters this year. sanders will also be the ranking member on the senate budget committee. acknowledging that he has a heavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the united states government, sanders said im going to do everything that i can to make sure that the budget that leaves the united states congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires. with the announcement of sanders new position, trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. hes spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. by elevating sanders to this new role, democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that sanders presidential campaign and vision for america resonated with many voters. as we saw with sanders popularity in the primaries, the vermont senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against trump as he takes office. sen. debbie stabenow d-mich. commented on sanders new responsibility we want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. we have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing. sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset trump, as hes been one of the most outspoken politicians on twitter since trumps win twitter twitter twitter 
however, sanders new role is great news for our country, and we know hes going to give trump hell.

"melania trump plagiarized her speech again  and this time from the most ridiculous source possible google pinterest digg linkedin reddit stumbleupon print delicious pocket tumblr 
the stakes were very high for melania trumps big campaign speech, the only one shes given since being very publicly mocked for stealing her best lines from the rnc from none other than first lady michelle obama. unfortunately for the trump campaign, the pressure must have gotten to her. 
she plagiarized again. 
it took less than an hour for people to figure it out, but the source will have people scratching their heads for days. melania, trumps third wife, seems to have lifted portions of her speech from marla maples, trumps second wife. 
while speaking about her experiences as an immigrant, melania said america meant if you could dream it, you could become it. 
tablet magazine writer yair rosenberg, simply put the line into google and saw what came up. it was a direct quote from marla maples given to a magazine in the 90s. melania just plagiarized trump's second wife marla maples. here's the only google results for ""if you could dream it, you could become it"" pic.twitter.comalehuszqem 
 yair rosenberg yair_rosenberg november 3, 2016 
is if you could dream it, you could become it a cliche? sure. is it weird that melania would say the exact same phrase that marla had? definitely. 
however, more damning is what else rosenberg noticed. it's not just the one cliched line, it's that the entire section about parentsopportunities is a ripoff, just like it was by michelle obama  
 yair rosenberg yair_rosenberg november 3, 2016 
its as if melania typed what she wanted to say into google, found the interview by marla maples, and simply made it her speech . 
educator and speechwriter yoni brander pointed out that the odd butchering of the truism if you can dream it, you can be it suggests melania really did lift the section directly from marla  the only other person on record as having screwed it up that way. 3. can dream it, you can become it."" by william a. ward. but the form used bymelania which cuts the beginning of the quote and changes 
 yoni brander yonibrander november 3, 2016 4. changes the tense to ""if you dream it, you could become it a variant that appears in only in one other place- marla maples interview 
 yoni brander yonibrander november 3, 2016 
it is also in line with how melania says she screwed up her rnc speech. she told reporters at the time that she accidentally plagiarized by harmlessly finding passages from other people that spoke to her and using them as her starting point. one of those passages, michelle obamas speech, made its way into the final draft. in the same way, it appears melania plagiarized her husbands ex-wife. 
to which one must conclude that trumps camp is run by an staggering assortment of incompetent buffoons. to screw up one major speech is a goof, to screw up two in a row thats a level of idiocy that is difficult to wrap ones head around. and while melania needs to stop using google to write her speeches, trumps campaign needs to spend five minutes making sure she doesnt steal lines from the candidates ex-wife. its not rocket science.

"is it possible that saudi king be tried in us courts by jasta law? email 

according to the jasta law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks, it is so likely that saudi king be tried. according to experts, the passing of jasta may cause international chaos. especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute us officials if us do so. 
is it possible that saudi king salman bin abdul aziz being tried for potential liability in events of september 11? the trial is possible by the legislation of jasta. by jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations. 
in late september, united states congress ignored president obamas advice and his veto and passed jasta law, the justice against sponsors of terrorism act. this law made us-saudi relation more chaotic. 
us confederate states expressed concern to jasta legislation 
not just saudi arabia expressed concerns to jasta, us confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the us quasi-sacred treaty with saudi arabia and asked for appealing. france and the netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against usa and its military and diplomacy allies. 
john kerry, united states secretary of state, showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk. a few days ago kerry and adel al-jubeir discussed about the ramifications of jasta and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of us interests. he said there are ways to fix the problem. while experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of america in complaining by circumvent the law. 
even saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system. 
according to hussein ibish, an expert on the persian gulf littoral states, jasta will cause chaos at the international level. 
last september, european union warned other countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity. this threat was an addition written letters to us government. 
also france, the netherlands and the united kingdom representatives discussed about the feedback of this law. the gulf littoral states, turkey, iraq, jordan, pakistan and japan protested against jasta. 
the saudi-us relations in danger of jasta 
bernard haykel, princeton university professor, said if saudi king does not appear in new york court to be interrogated, warrant will be issued against saudi arabia. riyadh and washington relations declined over the past three years especially with obama's policies on syria. jasta shows saudi ruling that obama turned his back to its allies in the middle east, he added. 
riyadh strictly denies his involvement in 911, while 15 of the 19 were from saudi arabia. turki al-faisal, the former head of saudi intelligence, also comments america wants to invade his most loyal friend over the past 70 years. 
jasta law does not refer to saudi arabia. it would allow families of the victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks to sue the perpetrators of the attack.",18,736266,fake

i did a story on 4chan on aug. 3, 2016, still report 1091 . since i thought it was true, i ran the story then. now, it no longer seems a bit flaky, because much of it has panned out. 
the particular 4chan thread that pertained to whether or not hillary clinton would not be recommended for indictment by fbi director jim comey was announced by an anonymous fbi analyst. 
now management of the thread has apparently been taken over by anonymous. the previous author may have met his fate at the hands of the conspirators attempting to steal the american election. what follows is the message, dated nov. 3, 2016 004333 
over the next few days many new documents will be released. the contents of these documents will contain evidence of perhaps the largest cover-up in american history. 
before this happens we would like to explain ourselves and answer a few questions you may have. 
until this month, wikileaks and anonymous have worked together building an efficient, detailed, comprehensive set of documents that would be responsible for the incarceration of hillary clinton, bill clinton, and 21 individuals ranging from the dnc, fbi, cia, and clinton foundation. 
these documents will show without a doubt, the evidence of treason, obstruction of justice, election fraud manipulation, and bribery. 
this was intended to be the october surprise. but before the release of these documents, we were contacted by a member of the fbi, as well as another from the cia, and a week later by the nypd. all with information pertaining to something much darker than even we imagine. due to the nature of these leaks, we all work together as efficiently as possible to ensure two objectives 1. that all necessary information would be given to the public in an organized, searchable, manageable way. 2. those who provided us with this information would be able to find safety before these releases were made this concern wasnt without warrant. 
the new leaks being released this week will provide documents in the form of emails pictures and videos. within these will be evidence of bill clinton, as well as, at least, six other government officials, taking part in sexual acts with minors. as well as evidence of human trafficking that also included minors. we believe these pictures and videos were taken for the purpose of political manipulation in order to make sure all participants followed through on a previously agreed agenda. 
these documents were given to us by an american government official when he had come to learn that this crime had been covered up by hillary and her staff through methods including bribery and blackmail. he also told us that due to the restricted access of these documents they would soon know he was the one who released them to us. we were trying to make arrangements for him to exit the country safely, but he was killed before those arrangements could be carried out.

"us government acknowledges that al-qaeda is not a priority in syria store us government acknowledges that al-qaeda is not a priority in syria one might ask, then if al-qaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? darius shahtahmasebi  anti media - october 26, 2016 comments 
last week, the u.s. state department acknowledged that al-qaeda-linked terror group jabhat al-nusra is not a priority for the united states efforts in syria. 
one might ask, then if al-qaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? 
state department spokesman john kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating 
the only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in syria is bashar al-assad and his supporters . we recognize al-nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, ive talked about this ad nauseam. 
largely missing from the american narrative of the syrian conflict is that al-nusra is shelling residential areas in aleppo, where the government holds control of the majority of aleppos citizens. in other parts of the world, these al-qaeda-linked extremists are seen as the enemy, whereas in syria, western media will often refer to them as mere rebel groups. 
the united states first officially used the term war on terror on september 20, 2011, to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of september 11. the stated aim at the time was to defeat islamic-linked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the u.s. government accused of supporting terrorism. 
in 2013, obama stated  
 we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror, but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten america. 
the fact that a terror group  one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the united states on american soil  is not a priority of the united states state department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is. 
this change in rhetoric, which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the middle east, is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from al-qaeda-linked terrorists. newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew. related articles",92,736263,fake
"canada and eu sign thoroughly undemocratic ceta trade deal canada and eu sign thoroughly undemocratic ceta trade deal opposition groups note that the deal could still fail legal scrutiny and ratification in europe by nadia prupis 
canada and the european union signed the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta on sunday amid widespread protests against the controversial deal that came back to life after negotiations stalled over objections from wallonia, belgium. 
environmental and democracy groups who opposed the agreement issued cautious statements condemning the signing but noting that ceta was not a done deal. 
this agreement will probably not survive the democratic and legal scrutiny of the ratification process over the coming months. its time for our governments to break rank with corporate lobbyists and redesign a trade policy that respects democracy and promotes the public interest, said shira stanton, trade policy adviser at greenpeace eu. 
ceta now faces a vote in the european parliament and ratification by the parliaments of the eus 28 countries. 
if it passes, ceta would create a legal system that allows corporations to sue governments for perceived loss of profit. that framework will also be put to scrutiny by the european court of justice and the german constitutional court, and if it fails to stand up would invalidate ceta. 
the deal has long been opposed on the grounds that it would harm human rights, democracy, and the climate, among other risks. 
alfred de zayas, the united nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, said in a statement saturday that each country should hold a referendum on signing the deal before doing so, warning that it was a corporate-driven, fundamentally flawed treaty. 
there is a legitimate fear that ceta will dilute environmental standards, food security, and health and labor protection, he said. a treaty that strengthens the position of investors, transnational corporations, and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats. 
global justice now gjn trade and migration campaigner guido tallman tweeted a picture of the massive deal and wrote, heres ceta. any mep planning to vote for it, should be sure to read it first. all of it. so they know what theyre voting for. 
throughout europe this weekend, ceta opponents took to the streets to protest the signing. in london on saturday, many posed outside the european commission office dressed as zombies to symbolize cetas seeming resurrection, urging commissioners to stop ceta rising from the dead. 
in brussels, some protesters broke through a barricade and attempted to storm the european commission building before being dragged away by police. 
gjn executive director nick dearden said saturday , the signing ceremony . . . means that ceta has been brought back from the dead for nowbut it is a ticking time bomb. the wallonia parliament has a promise that they will be able to stop the ratification of ceta when they get a formal vote on it, and unless there are substantial changes, theyand hopefully other parliamentswill use that veto. 
ceta would open up our government to a deluge of court cases by north american multinational corporations and investors, dearden continued. it presents a threat to our ability to protect the environment, to protect the public and to limit the power of big banks. its thoroughly undemocratic and must be stopped.

"trump called edward snowden a traitor, implied he should be executed the daily sheeple  by melissa dykes 
sure, hillary clinton is a banshee nightmare from hell, but that really doesnt mean donald trump is automatically amazing just because literally anything is better than hillary. thats a pretty low bar. 
trump has assured us hell give a lot more power to big brother as if we arent already living in an orwellian nightmare as it is. he has said that he will grow the police state, boost the patriot act, and extend the neverending wars he keeps mentioning iran specifically, because no matter who becomes president, they all know they have to sing that same old which path to persia? tune. once i even heard the man say he expects the nsa to be listening in to all our phone calls guess that makes it okay??? 
ಠ_ಠ 
trump has also called edward snowden a traitor and implied that he should be executed. 
he also banned snowden from miss universe which im sure mustve really broken poor edwards heart. message to edward snowden, youre banned from missuniverse . unless you want me to take you back home to face justice! 
 donald j. trump realdonaldtrump october 21, 2013 
while snowden may be a limited hangout, thats beside the point here. without snowden, we wouldnt have so much hard physical evidence of just how much our constitution has been trampled, our 4th amendment has been run over, and our privacy has been rendered nonexistent in the cybernetic technological control grid we now find ourselves living in. 
how is exposing the tyrannical governments crimes against the people a traitorous act worthy of death? 
and this talk of justice? 
real justice would be someone standing up for the constitution and bill of rights and challenging big brother and the nsa surveillance state, something neither trump nor hillary ever planned to do. 
then again, trump is the same guy who said he would take out the family members of terrorists. do you have a criminal in the family? how would you like to be killed because your family member is a criminal? same logic fail. 
like this government is honest about who the real terrorists even are anyway. come on. if were to believe trump is that naive, he shouldnt go anywhere near the oval office. 
then again, how does the saying go? everyone that would make a truly good president is smart enough to realize theyd never want to be president? not that presidents are really running anything in this country anyway

"shapiro eviscerates raucous protesters at university of wisconsin  daily wire shapiro eviscerates raucous protesters at university of wisconsin by hank berrien november 16, 2016 
daily wire editor-in-chief ben shapiro spoke at the university of wisconsin-madison on wednesday night, and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him, found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium. 
after the ovation he received on entering, shapiro quipped, hey look at this. a campus that doesnt actually try to arrest me when i come. he continued, before i begin, i did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room. i hear youve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how youre not one of these awful, terrible trump people, that youre sensitive, and that you want to signal your virtue, so ive brought along these safety pins, holding up safety pins and i also brought you something to wear them with  this diaper."" 
shapiro then held up a diaper, prompting huge laughs from the audience. 
when a protester yelled at shapiro that he should be wearing a swastika, shapiro held out his yarmulke, then fired back, in case you hadnt noticed, the folks with the swastikas arent too nice to my type. 
shapiro continued, stop being self-indulgent children; stop pretending that everybody who voted for trump is a vicious racist; its your right to protest, of course, but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a duly-held election  donald trump doesnt care about your protest. donald trump is sitting somewhere in trump tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty, salty tears. 
referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who werent university students from attending shapiros lecture, shapiro opined i hear that a lot of folks at this publicly-funded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants. i do have a quick question if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, why are so many people trying to ban american citizens from this community from coming to this lecture? and by the way, im aware of this private facebook page titled f white supremacy interrupting ben shapiro.' with all due respect, f you right back, gang. 
after the applause subsided and shapiro joked about how both black lives mater and the kkk target him, the real fun began. protesters stood up, chanting, shame over and over again. 
shapiro quipped, wow, its like game of thrones . should i get undressed and walk down the aisle? 
the bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters. shapiro addressed the protesters, saying, im happy to talk with you, but they responded by screaming safety over and over. shapiro joked, did somebody fart? the crowd responded to the protesters by chanting, usa. 
shapiro replied, i tell you try not to be children; the first thing you do is start screaming like my two-year-old. he added, you see, this is how conservatives actually treat people; you stand up and you interrupt and you shout safety, and youre perfectly safe. look at that. its amazing. that provoked sustained applause. 
when the protesters started screaming shame again, shapiro eviscerated them, pointing out, if youre going to pick a chant like shame, watch game of thrones first. the bad guys shout shame. the audience loved that line. on a roll, shapiro continued, youre not changing anybodys mind, all youre showing everybody is that your collective iq, if it were channeled into electricity, night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly. 
he continued, okay, can we talk now, or are you going to keep shouting? nows your chance to get it out. lets hear your feelings. cmon. just go for it. or is it going to be like every thirty seconds; like an annoying microwave timer? 
when the protesters resumed chanting, shapiro responded, if you guys want to talk, we can talk, if you want to shout, get the hell out. more applause. 
shapiro fired, for god's sake, at least wait until i say something that offends you before getting offended."" 
shapiro returned to deconstructing the term social justice. when the protesters started again, a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up, and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day, and that they should shut freaking up and listen to the man speak. that prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and shapiro. too. he added, see, thats what a decent, hard-working person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime, presumably. 
shapiro returned to his speech racial diversity doesnt mean anything; decency means everything  diversity isnt our strength; decency is our strength. he turned to the protesters remember that? decency. 
the protesters screamed back, shame! shapiro fired back, decency! the protesters chanted shame but the crowd soon joined shapiro in chanting decency, shutting the protesters up. 
as shapiro spoke of the falsity of white privilege, the protesters formed a line in front of shapiro, prompting him to quip, if you guys are all going to come up here, can we all just have circle time or something? 
the protesters chanted safety for a minute and a half, but then the crowd started yelling back, free speech matters. shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters, morons that again prompted cheering. 
one member of the audience yelled to the protesters, at least tell us what you want, or otherwise, just get out! that brought a sustained ovation. 
after one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue, the protesters started shouting safety again, then filed out, yelling f white supremacy while flipping off shapiro and the entire audience. that prompted the crowd to sing, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, good-bye. it also promoted this from shapiro 
even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door. 
after shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested, as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage, or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event, he continued, all i can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event. 
even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door, prompting shapiro to quip, doesnt this school give homework? does anybody have a job around here? i guess when youre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands. 
shapiro noted that he had engaged in a back-and-forth with one of the protesters, who accused him of being a white supremacist. when he asked her why she thought so, she replied that she got that impression from his image. he fired back, really? was it the yarmulke that did it for you? 
he took another shot at the protesters during the speech, noting that people were born unequal, and adding, some people us are born rich; some of us are born poor; some of us are born smart; some of us are born protesters. 
the rest of the speech was vintage shapiro, as was the qa afterward. even the chalk was impressive

"30 mins after fbi news, hillary exited plane did one dirty thing before 30 mins after fbi news, hillary exited plane did one dirty thing before posted on october 30, 2016 by robert rich in politics share this 
we know that the fbi reopening its investigation of hillary clintons emails couldnt have been good news for the presidential hopeful, but the fact that it took her a whopping 30 minutes to exit her plane after landing speaks volumes on the matter. however, it seems that hillary made sure to do one dirty thing before walking down those stairs. 
crooked hillary is a cowardly schemer  and her recent actions go to prove just that. mad world news reported friday that after the news broke of fbi director james comey reopening their investigation, hillary was seen rapidly exiting her plane and ignoring reporters before darting into her suv. just in clinton declines to answer questions about the fbi as she deplanes in cedar rapids. sat on tarmac for 30 minutes after news broke. pic.twitter.comzc115u7ynp

however, recent reports indicate that her dodging the matter at hand began far before that point . in fact, hillarys staff made sure to disable the planes wi-fi after the news broke so that the reporters onboard wouldnt learn of the matter until they got on the ground. of note as we wait for clinton plane had no wi-fi today. one adviser after we landed ""we're learning about this just like you all are."" pic.twitter.comcjsh71ljno

of course, hillary made sure to stay far away from the media seats until she got off the plane, but it didnt end there. as reporters had questions about hillary, an adviser used president barack obamas time-old line saying  were learning about this just like you all are. clintons plane did not have wifi. her advisors learned about the fbi letter when you did.   
 cnn cnn october 28, 2016 
although cnn tried their best to make it sound as if they didnt have internet access on the plane at all, the wall street journals byron tau came forward saying that hillarys plane is equipped with wi-fi. hillary has been dodging the consequences of her actions since the beginning of her campaign, but this is a new low for even her. the hillary plane has wifi.

"the media lost all of its political power last night -- thank you, donald trump!  daily wire the media lost all of its political power last night -- thank you, donald trump! by john nolte november 9, 2016 
the morally dark obama-era is over and utterly and totally repudiated. the clintons have finally and forever been staked in their mercenary black hearts. our smug, supremacist overlords in the elite establishment of both parties, these rotting, rent-seeking parasites, are now vanquished. but nothing is grander, nothing is more glorious, nothing is more satisfying, nothing is sweeter, nothing is more validating, nothing is better for america than the death of the mainstream media's political power. 
the elite national political media is done as a force, moral or otherwise, in this country. done. buried. exposed. over. out. and using a slow-acting poison called hubris, it was death by suicide. so smug. so sure of themselves. so sanctimonious. so snark-filled. so utterly incapable of anything close to self-reflection. 
the self-induced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps. 
here they are. 
1. pimping for obamacare 
the national political media didnt just cheerlead for obamacare, they lied to us. willfully and with malicious intent, they all lied to us. the outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill, right there in black and white. but the media didn't care. they wanted to give their precious obama a win and in order to do that, they jumped on board the ""you can keep your insurance"" propaganda express. worse, those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists, not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken fact-checkers. 
then utopia met reality. 
then the lies were exposed. 
and the result is that up to and including last night, at both the local and national level, obamacare has decimated the democrat party. but nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class. 
the media's role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority. from here on, they could only get more sweaty, desperate, and dangerous. 
2. casting off every journalistic ethic to destroy trump 
openly, proudly, and belligerently, in order to hijack a presidential election, we were treated to the pompous announcement that trump was such a threat to humanity, it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism, starting with objectivity. 
even former good guys like cnn's jake tapper morphed into an unrecognizable lyingsnarkvirtuesignalingmachines -- another rotting cog in the narrative wheel, a mindless member of a self-deluded, government-worshiping cult that wouldnt piss on middle america if we were on fire. 
professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag, baby! and who could miss the historic opportunity to self-righteously point-and-laugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a brave new world. 
3. grind donald trump to dust 
while there is no question trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way, never in my 50 years have i seen such a coordinated, desperate, dishonest, and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity. 
4. embracing confirmation bias 
the longer the general election rolled on, the smaller the bubble of self-delusion became. 
inconvenient polls were sneered at and voxsplained away. 
exit polls could only means one thing, even though it was pretty clear they might mean another. 
my personal favorite was the late editorials where, based on no counted votes whatsoever, we were trolled with the news that it was hillary, not trump, who would emerge victorious with the ""hidden vote!"" oh, the delicious irony of that. oh, how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes' faces on election night. 
by the time the votes were actually being counted, i was about 60 sure hillary would win. the new york times, however, was 92 sure. abcnbccbsapbsnprcnnwashingtonpostpolitico were 100 sure. 
but even i understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever, that hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper midwest, that the best pollster in the country had trump up 2, that trump never lost his fervent base, that the right trackwrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade, that there was still a larger-than-usual number of undecideds, that this thing that was real might not be enough to win, but it was still real. 
no, no, we were told, it's all smoke and mirrors, all gold-leafed trump steaks. look at obama's approval ratings! look at the hispanic vote! look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there. sit down, son, dont you understand that i'm a data machine? it's science, rube. don't you vox, racist? 
and then the worst thing imaginable happened. 
5. the media lost the election 
the hate, the lies, the removal of the mask of objectivity, the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table -- that can actually work  if you win. 
but the media didnt win. 
in the most spectacular fashion, with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see, they lost. 
and with that loss went everything. 
and now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a swaggering potemkin bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion, even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man, and do so with much of the republican party on their side. 
not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch, worse than all that, they are exposed as weak, a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again. 
without that sheen of fear, without that threat of intimidation, like a vanquished bully, so goes all their power. 
f you, mainstream media. 
-- 
the delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious barack obama correct about one thing 
the moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice.

"donald trump whines because isis cuts off heads, we should be able to waterboard by hrafnkell haraldsson   924 am ""we cant do waterboarding, its far too tough! were fighting on a different level! we have to be tough...and in some cases pretty vicious""   
donald trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the middle east that he supported, a war brought to us by a republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts. trump is also lying about the facts, which at least brings our countrys middle east ordeal full-circle. 
according to trump, speaking at a rally in new mexico  and youve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie  hillary brought disaster to iraq, syria, libya and every place that she touches. she empowered iran and she unleashed isis by leaving that big vacuum. 
of course, it was republican president george w. bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with iraq, stipulating that america draw down its combat strength. reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in iraq, or a negation of isis, but a second u.s. invasion on top of the rise of isis. 
we want peace through strength, trump told the crowd. we dont want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads. 
well, in fact we did want to be in that war. we invaded iraq, not vice versa. 
trump went on to say, 
drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand. we havent had  this is medieval times. this is medieval times and then we cant do waterboarding, its far too tough! you know, were fighting on a different level! see, were fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious, to be honest with you. pretty vicious, but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country  weve spent 6 trillion in the middle east. 6 trillion. and we couldve rebuilt our country twice. 
never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law; never mind that a 2014 senate intelligence committees report said torture doesnt work; trumps argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him. 
this is trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale, and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means. 
he doesnt, because he cant, prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesnt make us barbarians ourselves. he certainly cant prove, because that senate report says otherwise, that torturing people will win the war. 
the claim of 6 million, by the way, is one trump made last week in charlotte, nc as well, and politifact ruled it half true at the time, saying, 
trump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in iraq and afghanistan. yet he is confusing money thats been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. 
the point here is that this is a war begun not by obama and certainly not by hillary clinton, who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so, while trump continued to deny he was ever for it, despite the facts to the contrary. 
when trump says we have to be pretty vicious he is also saying we have to be pretty dishonest, and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as donald trump. 
trump has said he loves war. he has said he likes to be unpredictable. he has asked why we cant use nuclear weapons since we have them. this is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands. 
this is a man who, no matter how much he claims otherwise, does not understand how the world works. and he does not understand that by promoting torture, he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the islamic state, by promising to do precisely what they want him to do.",133,736268,real
"early voting is so strong for democrats that clinton could lock up nevada this week on meet the press, clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that early voting is so strong for democrats in nevada that hillary clinton could build an insurmountable lead this week. 
video 
chuck todd asked mook if he believed the email story could cost clinton the election. 
he answered 
i dont think so. look, as i said, we have over 50,000 volunteers out there. were seeing record early voting numbers in north carolina, florida. look, i would wager in nevada turnout is so strong among democrats there hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in nevada. were feeling really good about this record turnout. over 200 million people in our country now registered to vote. fifty million of those are young people. were just nose to the grindstone, and were going to finish this out. but people should not take anything for granted, and were going to have to work hard to earn this. 
hillary clinton could put nevada out of reach for trump this week, but whether or not that happens is up to the voters. if democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states, the email story wont matter. if democrats dont show up, that is trumps only chance of winning. 
the early voting numbers that hillary clinton is running up in florida, north carolina, and nevada are no accident. clinton and the democratic party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states. 
democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the 2016 election, but donal trumps refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area. 
the final week before the election could be just as vital to democrats in swing states as election day. if hillary clinton piles up big margins in early voting, it could leave minimal drama for election night. 
the democratic early voting plan is working to perfection, now as mook said, all that is left is for democrats to put their heads down, work hard, and close the deal.

"lol! british wife of lib actor who said there will never be a president donald trumpwarns americans about president-elect trump video go to article 
political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j. trump and his tough immigration policies. maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders. it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, there will never be a president trump. 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us -mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of president-elect trumps proposals would be violations of international law. 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of george clooney, said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans. 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign, that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the u.s. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that. 
the 38-year-old wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to, are these things actually going to happen?, or is the u.s. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally, according to the hollywood reporter. 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george, a staunch hillary clinton supporter, have spoken out against trump in the past. 
earlier this year, amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views. 
watch george clooney here whine about press giving trump too much favorable press 
when you listen to what the leading candidate on the republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding mexicans and a complete shutdown of all muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about muslims, he kept saying, they only want jihad. they dont believe in our way of life. they dont respect our system, clooney said. via daily mail",0,736288,real
"state that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes state that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes 'this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority' published 3 mins ago about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in 2006 after nearly three decades with the associated press, as well as several upper midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. print dr. eric walsh photo first liberty 
the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church. 
but dr. eric walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons. 
walshs ordeal began in may 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventh-day adventist church. 
lee rudd, the agencys human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately. two days later, walsh was fired. 
at that point, lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks, chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the constitution. order today! 
now, in response to walshs lawsuit, the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, copies of his sermon notes and transcripts. 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church, said jeremy dys, senior counsel for first liberty. 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons, said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so. 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen. 
the mayor at the time, annise parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . 
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case, welch said, i cant believe im saying this, but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from  us. 
welch, the executive director of the texas pastor council, said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons. 
first, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city, he said. also, the state is demanding much more material sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible. its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study. this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in america. 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee, part of the nations largest public policy womens group with 500,000 members, also came to walshs defense. 
penny nance, ceo, said the words of reverend dr. martin luther king, jr., that, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapo-like tactics of his native state. the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, dr. eric walsh, is indeed a threat to every american, whatever our religious beliefs. 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share? 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him. 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon, dys told fox news when the case was filed. he was fired for something he said in a sermon. if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything. the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist. 
state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing. 
the telephone call was between dr. patrick oneal, an agency official, and kate pfirman, an agency financial officer. the call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. 
pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold, because i dont want to say very much. if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through, its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway. 
then there was laughter from both parties. 
oneal then said to inform walsh, youre out, and there was another round of laughter. 
its very funny, pfirman said.

"the only way to save the world is to save yourself the only way to save the world is to save yourself nov 11, 2016 0 0 
we are not here to save the world. we are here to save ourselves, but in doing so, we save the world.  joseph campbell 
as i write this, some shit is probably going down at standing rock . for anybody awake to the tyranny at hand, the events of the last few months have weighed heavily on our hearts. but the thing people need to remember is this were all native americans. if you were born in the usa, and you love the land you were born on which includes the entire fucking planet, by the way!, you are a native american. you are a native earthling, for shits sake. its all connected. their fight is our fight. skin color is irrelevant. where you were born or where you migrated to is irrelevant. the only thing relevant is this are you for freedom, life, cooperation, and love; or are you for statism, profit, divisiveness, and violence? as derrick jensen said, we are the governors as well as the governed. this means that all of us who care about life need to force accountability onto those who do not. 
the media even the alternative media, mind you is trying to spin this as a land issue, or a native american issue. but its not. this is a freedom versus tyranny issue. this is an anarchy versus statism issue. this is a life versus entropy issue. all land is free. we just need to quit focusing on imaginary lines and think cooperation first, competition second. all human beings are free. we just need to quit being obsequious to state-driven authority and start asking and answering the tough questions. 
the only way to save the world is to save yourself. the only way to save the land from being poisoned is to save yourself from being poisoned and from poisoning the land, yourself. the only way to save the environment from pollution is to save yourself from pollution and from polluting the environment, yourself. in other words the only way to save the crashing plane that is the human race is to put the oxygen mask on yourself first before attempting to put it on anybody else, and especially before attempting to right the plane. the oxygen mask, if you havent gathered already, is a metaphor for health, awareness, and truth. save yourself 
only the individual can rise to the heights of consciousness and awareness. the more you belong to the crowd, the deeper you fall into darkness.  osho 
saving yourself is putting on the oxygen mask of health, awareness, and truth. but what does that mean? it means questioning yourself to the nth degree , to the point of self-interrogation, and then questioning some more. it means psychosocial upheaval. it means getting uncomfortable. it means admitting you are wrong. in short it means pain, existential pain of monumental proportions. 
why is it so painful? because much cognitive dissonance must be navigated. everything that youve taken for granted as a fundamental truth must be turned inside out and given proper scrutiny. after such scrutiny, you will likely find that you were wrong about a great many things. but the only tool you need to weigh yourself against your deep questioning is the following anonymous quote when an honest man realizes that he is mistaken, he will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest. 
the question is do you have the courage to be honest with yourself? because if you honestly choose the moral side of freedom, life, cooperation, and love, then youre going to have to admit that statism provides none of these. it only sells the illusion of these. 
statism is about profit, ownership, divisiveness, and violence. it steals peoples freedom by enforcing, and profiting on, outdated and unjust laws but only if the person believes in the law. it stifles life and human flourishing through calculative debt slavery and by convincing people into believing in an illusory debt. it creates physical divisiveness by drawing imaginary lines in the sand and declaring them borders. it creates psychological divisiveness through xenophobic nationalism and conditioned flag worship, setting up an us-versus-them mentality. when, really, the only us-versus-them mentality that holds any moral weight and intellectual validity is the freedom versus tyranny position. 
statism is tyrannical. theres simply no way to wiggle out of this fact. it teaches authoritarianism and oppression. it teaches the individual to oppress and to tyrannize himherself and others. it teaches people to blindly follow and obsequiously respect authority. it teaches extortion and violence. for if the authority of the state is not obeyed, or its many outdated and immoral laws are not followed, the individual is forced, violently if need be, to acquiesce. comply or die, is what it comes down to. either that or your freedom is taken away from you. 
so, when it comes down to it, saving yourself is, first and foremost, waking yourself up from the spell that statism has over you . and then its breaking that spell. break that particular spell, and freedom is at hand. break that particular spell, and  your  life begins. break that particular spell, and you free yourself to learn how cooperation and love actually work, because you will finally begin taking responsibility for your own shit. no masters. no rulers. that means taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions as a social creature on an interdependent planet. no more leaning on the crutch of authority. no more codependence on the state. saving yourself is choosing freedom. save the world 
the modern hero, the modern individual who dares to heed the call and seek the mansion of that presence with whom it is our whole destiny to be atoned, cannot, indeed must not, wait for his community to cast off its slough of pride, fear, rationalized avarice, and sanctified misunderstanding. live, nietzsche says, as though the day were here. it is not society that is to guide and save the creative hero, but precisely the reverse. and so, every one of us shares the supreme ordealcarries the cross of the redeemernot in the bright moments of his tribes great victories, but in the silences of his personal despair. joseph campbell 
so, youve saved freed yourself from the grip of the state. what comes next? freeing others, of course. but not so fast. just because youre free from the state, doesnt mean the state isnt still there, rearing its ugly head. it is still there, oppressing and extorting. it is still there, tyrannizing and destroying the planet under the guise of progress. its still there, trying to suck you back in. it is still goliath and you are still david. and just because you recognize statism as tyranny and oppression, doesnt mean that others do. remember most people are devoted statists who dont even realize they are statists. yes, the ignorance is that thick. but, i digress 
youve secured your oxygen mask on the crashing plane that is the human race. now its time to start helping others to secure their own masks. the problem here is you cant control other people. and, really, you dont want to. you want people to be free, after all. that means youre going to have to convince them . youre going to have to be creative. youre going to have to use your imagination and come up with novel ways to persuade them into being healthy. yes, sadly it has come to that. the only way to bring health to those who are all-too-well-adjusted to a sick society, is to sell it. 
the real kick in the pants is most people dont want to hear what you have to say. people are wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance. people are caught up in their own state driven conditioning and brainwashing. those cops serving and protecting the enforcement of the unhealthy, unsustainable, climate changing game ender north dakota pipeline , are all wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance, conditioning, and brainwashing. theyre simply losing their own inner battle and coming up with the only thing they know the cowardice and violence of a statist. 
so, it comes down to this what do we those who are already free and have their oxygen mask securely fastened do against the cowardice and violence of the inured statist? we teach. we use our imagination to persuade them away from the unhealthiness of the state and toward the healthiness of freedom. we lead by example, influencing them with our courageous words and our actions. we coax them into freely putting their own oxygen mask on. for we know that volition is paramount if freedom is to be had. force is the way of the state. violence is the way of the state. a free human being helping others to be free must never use force or violence, lest they wish to be a tyrant. an authentically free human being wishes other human beings to be just as authentically free. 
but, and heres the rub, as oliver wendell holmes said, your right to waive your fist ends one inch from my nose. 
this means that when our health and freedom are under attack, we are morally justified to defend ourselves. and so, the most important thing we can do as free people, as individuals who have our oxygen masks securely fastened, is to stand our ground. to protect ourselves. which, by extension, means protecting that which immediately sustains us water, and the land that grows our food. the worst thing we can do is back down and play the pacifist. like derrick jensen said,  love does not imply pacifism. the goliath that is the state will trample all over pacifism. indeed, the road to an unhealthy, unsustainable, immoral, and violent world is paved with pacifism. its paved with people turning a blind eye. its paved with the inaction of people who recognized evil and did fuckall with it. 
at the end of the day, goliath the state is going to be goliath. but goliath is only goliath because people believe in it. we dismantle goliath by convincing people not to give into goliaths unhealthy and unsustainable song and dance. first, we extract ourselves from being goliath by transforming ourselves into courageous davids. then, we attempt to extract others from being goliath. and if we cannot, we stand our ground and point out their cowardice and violence as unacceptable. we draw a line in the sand. we stand our ground. we protect our water. we declare, right in the face of the goliath state, these courageous words by thoreau  i was not designed to be forced. i will breathe after my own fashion. let us see who is the strongest.

"british welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims calais deputy mayor british welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims calais deputy mayor british welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims calais deputy mayor by 0 151 
a french politician has blamed britain for the crisis in calais, claiming it was the uks welfare system that drove so many migrants to gather in the border town. 
philippe mignonet, the deputy mayor of calais, believes the demolition of the jungle refugee camp will not stop the thousands of migrants from congregating in the french port town in the hope of crossing the english channel. 
read more 
the uk government says it does not want any more migrants but it never expels migrants who get there, mignonet told the daily mail . 
they claim benefits and housing, and all we get is the british-funded wall and fences. 
for mignonet, the 2 million us2.4 million british-funded wall being built around the loading area of the eurotunnel, which allows goods trucks to come from france into britain, is simply not enough. 
what english city would accept a fence and a wall being built by another country on their land? if the british government want to improve matters, they should come and talk to the city of calais, he added. 
mignonet invited prime minister theresa may to visit the town, and even offered to give her a covert ride from the airport. 
i have a car with dark windows, so she doesnt have to be seen, mignonet said. 
calais was once part of england, and we have often worked together in the past. we can work together again. the people of britain made their choice about brexit, and some of those choices mean they will face difficulty, but putting walls and fences up here is not right. 
the wall, which is seen as a blight on the coastal town, could also affect the price of the land once occupied by the jungle camp, which will soon be ready for private development. 
this is at the door of england, and near to the shuttle terminal for trucks, mignonet said. what better place for british businesses to come? tighter border 
the british public appears unmoved by french concerns. a new poll suggests most brits would rather see their borders tightly secured than stay in the single market. 
according to a poll commissioned by itv, 58 percent of brits approve of mays brexit strategy of prioritizing immigration controls over the negotiation of the uks access to the single market. only a quarter were against. 
just over 40 percent of those asked insisted eu trade benefits should be prioritized throughout the divorce. however, a similar sky news poll found the opposite to be the case. 
a breakdown of the data, however, showed twice as many older brits support mays hard brexit and immigration control policies as the younger demographic.

"ron paul blame government, not markets for monopoly ron paul blame government, not markets for monopoly 11012016 
eurasia review 
when time-warner announced it planned to merge with another major communications firm, many feared the new company would exercise near-total monopoly power. these concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both time-warners competitors and consumers. 
no, i am not talking about time-warners recent announced plan to merge with att, but the reaction to time-warners merger with then internet giant aol in 2000. far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all competitors, the aol-time-warner merger fell apart in under a decade. 
the failure of aol-time-warner demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace. aol-time-warner failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices andor better quality. 
corporate mergers and hostile takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors. these managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with affordable, quality products. thus, laws making it difficult to launch a hostile takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm investors, workers, and consumers. 
monopolies and cartels are creations of government, not markets. for example, the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees. similarly, anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal regulations, they must sign a franchise agreement with their local government. fortunately, the internet has given americans greater access to news and ideas shut out by the government-licensed lapdogs of the mainstream media. this may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web. 
government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry. large companies can afford the costs of complying with government regulations, costs which cripple their smaller competitors. big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business. 
examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the food and drug administrations fda regulations that raise costs of developing a new drug, as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals. another example is the dodd-frank legislation, which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors. 
legislation forcing consumers to pay out-of-state sales tax on their online purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less politically-powerful competitors. this legislation is being pushed by large brick-and-mortar stores and internet retailers who are seeking a government-granted advantage over smaller competitors. 
many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the federal reserves inflationary monetary policy. perhaps the most famous example of this is the aol-time-warner fiasco, which was a direct result of the fed-created dot.com bubble. 
in a free market, mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices. any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices andor higher quality. monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of well-connected crony capitalists. therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the regulations, taxes, and subsides that benefit politically-powerful businesses. the most important step is to end the boom-bust business cycle by ending the federal reserve.

"not guilty the power of nullification to counteract government tyranny go to article 
the people have the power, all we have to do is awaken that power in the people. the people are unaware. theyre not educated to realize that they have power. the system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything. we are the government . john lennon 
how do you balance the scales of justice at a time when americans are being tasered , tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed , hit with batons, shot with rubber bullets and real bullets, blasted with sound cannons , detained in cages and kennels , sicced by police dogs, arrested and jailed for challenging the governments excesses, abuses and power-grabs? 
politics wont fix a system that is broken beyond repair. 
no matter who sits in the white house, the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes. 
relying on the courts to restore justice seems futile. 
indeed, with every ruling handed down, it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice, with government courts, largely lacking in vision and scope, rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law. this is true at all levels of the judiciary, but especially so in the highest court of the land, the u.s. supreme court, which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the constitution. 
even so, justice matters. 
it matters whether youre a rancher protesting a federal land-grab by the bureau of land management, a native american protesting an oil pipeline that will endanger sacred sites and pollute water supplies, or an african-american taking to the streets to protest yet another police shooting of an unarmed citizen. 
unfortunately, protests and populist movements havent done much to push back against an authoritarian regime that is deaf to our cries, dumb to our troubles, blind to our needs, and accountable to no one. 
it doesnt matter who the activists are environmentalists, peaceniks, native americans, black lives matter, occupy, or the bundys and their followers or what the source of the discontent is endless wars abroad, police shootings, contaminated drinking water, government land-grabs, the governments modus operandi has remained the same shut down the protests using all means available, prosecute first amendment activities to the fullest extent of the law, and discourage any future civil uprisings by criminalizing expressive activities, labelling dissidents as extremists or terrorists, and conducting widespread surveillance on the general populace in order to put down any whispers of resistance before it can take root. 
thus, if there is any means left to us for thwarting the government in its relentless march towards outright dictatorship, it may rest with the power of juries and local governments to invalidate governmental laws, tactics and policies that are illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional. 
just recently, in fact, an oregon jury rejected the governments attempts to prosecute seven activists who staged a six-week, armed takeover of the malheur national wildlife refuge. 
in finding the defendants not guiltyof conspiracy to impede federal officers, of possession of firearms in a federal facility, and of stealing a government-owned truckthe jury sent its own message to the government and those following the case justice matters. 
the malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility their lawyers argued the guns were as much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans. they were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers. they were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks, thereby preventing workers from performing their duties as the washington post points out, this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist left-wingers and earth first protesters . 
many other equally sincere activists with eloquent lawyers and ardent supporters have gone to jail for lesser offenses than those committed at the malheur refuge, so what made the difference here? 
the jury made all the difference. 
these seven oregon protesters were found not guilty because a jury of their peers recognized the sincerity of their convictions, sympathized with the complaints against an overreaching government, and balanced the scales of justice using the only tools available to them common sense, compassion and the power of the jury box. 
jury nullification works. 
as law professor ilya somin explains, jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the law in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive . according to former federal prosecutor paul butler, the doctrine of jury nullification is premised on the idea that ordinary citizens, not government officials, should have the final say as to whether a person should be punished. 
imagine that a world where the citizenrynot the government or its corporate controllersactually calls the shots and determines what is just. 
in a world of  rampant overcriminalization , where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day, jury nullification acts as  a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization and the increasing network of confusing laws that are passed with neither the approval nor oftentimes even the knowledge of the citizenry. 
indeed, butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises  
if you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case, i recommend that you vote not guilty  even if you think the defendant actually smoked pot, or sold it to another consenting adult. as a juror, you have this power under the bill of rights ; if you exercise it, you become part of a proud tradition of american jurors who helped make our laws fairer. 
in other words, its we the people who can and should be determining what laws are just, what activities are criminal and who can be jailed for what crimes. 
not only should the punishment fit the crime, but the laws of the land should also reflect the concerns of the citizenry as opposed to the profit-driven priorities of corporate america. 
this is where the power of jury nullification is so critical to reject inane laws and extreme sentences and counteract the edicts of a profit-driven governmental elite that sees nothing wrong with jailing someone for a lifetime for a relatively insignificant crime. 
of course, the powers-that-be dont want the citizenry to know that it has any power at all. 
they would prefer that we remain clueless about the governments many illicit activities, ignorant about our constitutional rights, and powerless to bring about any real change. 
in an age in which government officials accused of wrongdoingpolice officers, elected officials, etc.are treated with general leniency, while the average citizen is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, jury nullification is a powerful reminder that, as the constitution tells us, we the people are the government. 
for too long weve allowed our so-called representatives to call the shots. now its time to restore the citizenry to their rightful place in the republic as the masters, not the servants. 
nullification is one way of doing so. 
various cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to  claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded . 
where nullification can be particularly powerful, however, is in the hands of the juror. 
the reality with which we must contend is that justice in america is reserved for those who can afford to buy their way out of jail. 
for the rest of us who are dependent on the fairness of the system, there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day. police misconduct. prosecutorial misconduct. judicial bias. inadequate defense. prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice. judges who care more about what is legal than what is just. jurors who know nothing of the law and are left to deliberate in the dark about life-and-death decisions. and an overwhelming body of laws, statutes and ordinances that render the average american a criminal, no matter how law-abiding they might think themselves. 
if youre to have any hope of remaining freeand i use that word looselyyour best bet remains in your fellow citizens. 
your fellow citizens may not know what the constitution says studies have shown americans to be abysmally ignorant about their rights, they may not know what the laws are there are so many on the books that the average american breaks three laws a day without knowing it, and they may not even believe in your innocence, but if youre lucky, those who serve on a jury will have a conscience that speaks louder than the legalistic tones of the prosecutors and the judges and reminds them that justice and fairness go hand in hand. 
thats ultimately what jury nullification is all about restoring a sense of fairness to our system of justice. its the best protection for we the people against the oppression and tyranny of the government, and god knows, we can use all the protection we can get. its a powerful way to remind the governmentall of those bureaucrats who have appointed themselves judge, jury and jailer over all that we are, have and dothat were the ones who set the rules. 
we could transform this nation if only americans would work together to harness the power of their discontent. 
unfortunately, the governments divide and conquer tactics are working like a charm. 
despite the laundry list of grievances that should unite we the people in common cause against the government, the nation is more divided than ever by politics, by socio-economics, by race, by religion, and by every other distinction that serves to highlight our differences. 
the real and manufactured events of recent yearsthe invasive surveillance, the extremism reports, the civil unrest, the protests, the shootings, the bombings, the military exercises and active shooter drills, the color-coded alerts and threat assessments, the fusion centers, the transformation of local police into extensions of the military, the distribution of military equipment and weapons to local police forces, the government databases containing the names of dissidents and potential troublemakershave all conjoined to create an environment in which we the people are more divided, more distrustful, and fearful of each other. 
what we have failed to realize is that in the eyes of the government, were all the same. 
in other words, when its time for the government to crack downand that time is comingit wont matter whether we supported hillary or trump, whether we stood with the pipeline protesters or opposed blm, or whether we spoke out against government misconduct and injustice or remained silent. 
when the government cracks down, well all suffer. 
heres the thing the government wants a civil war. 
the objective compliance and control. 
its strategy destabilize the economy through endless wars, escalate racial tensions, polarize the populace, heighten tensions through a show of force, intensify the use of violence, and then, when all hell breaks loose, clamp down on the nation for the good of the people and the security of the nation. 
the government has been anticipating and preparing for such a civil uprising for some time now. 
those protests in ferguson , baltimore and baton rouge to protest police brutality? the militarized police  clad in kevlar vests, helmets, and camouflage, armed with pistols, shotguns, automatic rifles, and tear gas  turning towns into war zones? the kenneling of pipeline protesters in north dakota? 
those were just dress rehearsals for the government to work out the kinks in its operating manual on how to deal with civil unrest. 
they were also previews of whats in store if we continue to challenge the powers-that-be. 
after all, its hard to persuade anyone to stand against tyranny when all you can promise them as a reward is persecution, prosecution and a one-way trip to the morgue. and when the outcome seems to be a foregone conclusionthe government always winsit can seem pointless, even foolhardy, to dare to challenge the system. 
so how do you not only push back against the police states bureaucracy, corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means? 
you start by changing the rules and engaging in some nonviolent guerilla tactics. 
employ militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , which martin luther king jr. used to great effect through the use of sit-ins, boycotts and marches. 
take part in grassroots activism, which takes a trickle-up approach to governmental reform by implementing change at the local level in other words, think nationally, but act locally. 
and then, as i explain in more detail in my book battlefield america the war on the american people , nullify everything. nullify the court cases. nullify the laws. nullify everything the government does that is illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional.",70,736269,fake

"clemson university student's welcome 'ben shapiro is a pig'  daily wire clemson university student's welcome 'ben shapiro is a pig' by hank berrien november 1, 2016 
apparently word has been passed to leftists that daily wire editor-in chief ben shapiro will be speaking at clemson university tonight. ""ben shapiro is a pig"" was chalked in a clemson classroom this morning. looks like the sjws are very excited to hear benshapiro tonight! pic.twitter.comhkd3ygiwmn  caleb ecarma calebecarma november 1, 2016 
there has been no explanation as to who decorated the chalkboard, nor whether the culprit wanted to issue a more eloquent denunciation of shapiro but was hindered by the limits of hisher vocabulary, thus being restricted to words of three letters or less. 
shapiros usual denunciation of political correctness is likely the reason for the gratuitous insult; in october 2015, clemson was plagued by pc when a few students protested clemson dinings ""maximum mexican"" night, tweeting their displeasure with such a ""culturallyinsensitive"" event. clemson senior austin pendergist told campus reform the post-event uproar was ridiculous  this is something that clemson dining has done for years without any sort of backlash. people love the cultural nights in the dining halls. what's next? are they going to take away all potato based food as to not offend students from irish decent? remove the stir fry station so asian-american students don't feel as if they are being misrepresented? when does it end? 
but the administration wound up apologizing for the event; dr. doug hallenbeck, clemson universitys senior associate vice president of student affairs, said the event displayed a flattened cultural view of mexican culture  it is the mission of university housing  dining to create supportive and challenging environments that enrich and nourish lives. we failed to live out our mission yesterday, and we sincerely apologize, adding that the university will continue to work closely with its food service provider to create dining programs that align with clemson universitys core values. 
the administration also apologized on the clemson dining services facebook and twitter pages.

democratic party officials in fairfax county, virginia, are categorically denying that pro-democrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot, arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee, or fcdc. 
earlier this week, jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot. see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article. also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters. 
i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year, jena explained. then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot. 
in recent days, at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots. 
after the report was first published, and shared on facebook by david jones, fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained. 
these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot. the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections. political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots. the two envelopes arrived at the same time, commented anderson. 
that triggered a quick back-and-forth between david jones and anderson. 
i hate to tell you but youre wrong. all items came in one envelope, jones said. 
like the reporting you see here? sign up for free news alerts from wnd.com, americas independent news network. 
impossible. that letter came out of my office. we never have access to other peoples ballots, replied anderson. 
then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters, said jones. who should i believe? you or my lying eyes? 
anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot, and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives. 
i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed. we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots. you can believe what you want to believe, concluded anderson. 
the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response. but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america, anderson protested the premise of the story. 
please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim, stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate. 
he shared a photo sent by state sen. scott surovell, showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy. 
in a formal interview, fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true. 
its not possible, said neilson, who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats. 
voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen, he said. the activity of voting is also a public record. the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot. we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed. 
the same day the ballot is mailed, our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot, said neilson, noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax. 
listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson 
however, he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself. 
that material is mailed in a separate envelope, labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax, virginia, and would be received either the same day, perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government, neilson said. 
its a separate mailing. its a separate stamp. its a separate envelope. its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes, he said. 
jones is standing by her story 100 percent, as is her husband. david says its a very clear memory. 
jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot, the green sample ballot, the two-sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature. there was also the return envelope, which i signed, david said. 
the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters. both of them commented on reddit. 
i can confirm this. i live in herndon, va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot. i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it, stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename. 
get the hottest, most important news stories on the internet  delivered free to your inbox as soon as they break! take just 30 seconds and sign up for wnds email news alerts! 
another, under the reddit handle nightingale-nights, said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week. 
neilson said there is no way the county government, which sends out the ballots, could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot. 
they dont have our materials, he said. our materials are printed for us, by our printer, and we have complete control over our materials in our office, and they come from our office in our mailing. they dont go anywhere else. 
its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials. its never happened before. im not aware of it happening now. and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future, neilson said. 
there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county, leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible. he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot. 
i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots. i believe that, jones said. i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material. i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope. but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues. 
neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true. 
i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail, neilson said. 
he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight. 
i am an election official. on election day, i serve in a non-partisan capacity for our county election office, nielson said. i can assure you, you have democrats and republicans working in the office. you have plenty of oversight of the voting process, and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot. there is no way that happened. 
the following are three images of the democratic party materials jena and david jones say they found stuffed inside the absentee ballot

"michelle obama poses in a pretty dress, so racist conservatives call her a monkey screenshots on november 12, 2016 354 pm  
trump fans may have won the election, but they arent taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of michelle obama. the donalds deplorables were out in force after the first lady posed for the cover of vogue. 
i could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine, obama told the magazine . i could have focused on flowers. i could have focused on decor. i could have focused on entertainment. because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. theres no legislative authority; youre not elected. and thats a wonderful gift of freedom. 
in exercising her freedom, michelle obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans  and in exercising their freedom, the right has responded with nothing but hate. the reaction to the first lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. readers of yahoo news showered obama with racist remarks, calling her an ape and a monkey and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. 
if you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. trump fans are not done by a long shot  and now they have been emboldened by america electing its first official kkk candidate. 
it will get worse before it gets better.

even as the heat continues to rise on donald trump due to his extensive connections to the russian government and other russian entities, new revelations are coming out of the woodwork. senator harry reid has revealed that the fbi has been investigating the russian hackers for months whose actions benefited trumps campaign. and now a group of respected computer scientists has uncovered the secret computer server that trump has been using to coordinate with the russians. 
the group of computer scientists, whose work has been verified by slate and vouched for by other members of the cybersecurity community, initially thought they might have uncovered russian malware. but in studying the specific patterns of data flow, they instead determined that it represented two way communication. while they cant be certain, their belief based on studying the data patterns is that these communications are emails. another outside computer scientist was asked to verify the evidence, and he confirmed that it did indeed represent human-level communication. 
so just whom has donald trump been privately coordinating all this time? alfa bank, the largest bank in russia. 
this falls in line with the months-ago admission by donald trump jr. that his father has taken on a growing and disproportionate amount of investment read debt from the russians since he entered the presidential race. couple that admission with this new revelation that trump has been secretly coordinating with the russians to whom hes suddenly become so egregiously in debt, and it becomes clear why senator reid has outed the ongoing secret fbi investigation in question. read the extensive slate investigation into donald trumps russian server. if you enjoy daily news bin, consider making a contribution contributed by daily news bin staff 776",40,736268,fake

"canadian immigration website crashes as millions hear of trump victory its almost statistically impossible that you havent heard at least one person threaten to move to canada if donald trump won the presidential election. well, he did. and it appears that at least some of those would-be emigrants werent kidding. at around 11 pm tuesday night  just as things really went to hell for hillary clinton  canadas immigration website began to receive record breaking traffic. it then crashed completely. 
in case you were wondering, moving to canada can be quite difficult . it may even take years. to some degree it depends on what profession youre in and how desired the work you do would be to the nation of canada. upon writing this the website still will not load reliably; but in the off chance its running properly by the time you read this ive included a link  here . 
the worlds stock markets have been sent into turmoil at the shocking news that reality tv star donald trump actually pulled off the win. but if youre thinking of moving to canada just because of the impending stock market armageddon, dont bother. its likely that the whole world will go into another recession if trump really scraps the trade deals hes promising to. sort of like a brexit on a much bigger scale. in fact, many are saying that the combined influence of the uks departure from the eu and ours from the majority of our trade relationships might spell a very wide-spread fiscal crisis. 
trump, for one, tried to calm these fears in his victory speech. he said that he plans to deal with everyone fairly. but this is unlikely to work. the market ultimately responds cautiously to change and whether that change is going to be fair or not doesnt really make much difference. trump has promised to do away with the establishment. and thats likely to scare economists. one can only hope that as our new president, he proceeds with the cautious tone he could not find during the campaign. or we could just all move to canada.

"is goat milk better than cow milk? plus a list of health benefits in general health while cows milk remains one of americas most common daily drinks, it is interesting to note that it may also be the reason why many americans experience gas , bloating and other forms of indigestion. when the average cow is given growth hormones, antibiotics, gmo feed, vaccinations and exposed to toxic conditions, it is no wonder that many humans experience negative effects from consuming pasteurized cow milk . goats milk is a much healthier alternative, especially when it is raw and organic. goats produce about 2 of the global milk supply and it is interesting that most of the populations of people who consume goat milks cite a lower incidence of allergies and digestive complaints. the benefits of goat milk goats milk offers a wide variety of health benefits, with very few of the negative side effects of drinking regular cow milk. 1. reaction to inflammation some research suggests that one of the main benefits of goat milk is that it may benefit inflammation. another reason why it is easier for people with bowel inflammation to drink goats milk, instead of cows milk. 2. environmentally friendly goats requires far less space and food than cows. typically, you can comfortably raise six goats on the same acreage as two cows. 3. metabolic agent studies done at the usda and prairie view am university, link goats milk to an increased ability to metabolize iron and copper, especially amongst individuals with digestion and absorption limitations. besides drinking goats milk, you can also take a digestive enzymes supplement to help with this also. 4. bio-availability another main health benefit of goat milk, is that it is closer to human mothers milk than cows milk is. because it has a chemical make up that is much closer to human milk, it is easier to digest and assimilate in the human body. 5. smaller fat smaller fat? does that mean it has less fat? not necessarily, it means that the size of the fat molecules in goats milk are much smaller than those found in cows milk. this makes goats milk easier to digest. 6. high in fatty acids while cows milk has about seventeen percent fatty acids, goats milk averages thirty five percent fatty acids, making it more nutritionally wholesome. in fact, up to 50 of people with lactose intolerance to cows milk find that they can easily digest goats milk, especially if it is raw. 7. calcium-rich many people worry that they need to drink cows milk for calcium intake and the prevention of bone loss. goats milk also offers high amounts of calcium, the amino acid tryptophan, and much less side effects of drinking cows milk. its just one of the many foods high in calcium . 8. anti-mucousal while drinking cows milk is a common reason for allergies and excess mucous, goats milk is not. cows milk is high in fat, which may increase mucous build-up. moreover, the fat globules in goats milk are one ninth the size of those found in cows milk, another possible reason why it does not produce irritation in the gut. 9. ultra-nourishing in naturopathic medicine, goats are referred to as bioorganic sodium animals. they are also associated with vigour, flexibility and vitality. cows are calcium animals known for stability and heaviness. bioorganic sodium is an important element in keeping joints mobile and limber. goat milk has traditionally been used in medicinal cultures to nourish and regenerate an over-taxed nervous system. goats milk is also extremely nutrient dense. it has almost 35 of your daily needs for calcium in one cup. extremely high in riboflavin, just one cup of goats milk offers 20.0 of our daily needs. add to that high amounts of phosphorous, vitamin b12, protein and potassium. in fact, ghandi himself rejuvenated his own health after extremely long periods of fasting through drinking raw goats milk  1  . 10. less toxic than cows milk whereas most cows milk is pumped full of bovine growth hormones as well as a substance known as bovine somatotropin, a hormone specific for increasing milk production in an unnatural way, goats are rarely treated with these substances. because of its use on the fringes of big agriculture, goats milk is not only more nutritious for you, but also less toxic. 11. may boost immune system goats milk has the trace mineral, selenium, a key essential mineral in keeping the immune system strong and functioning normally. why you should drink goat milk over cows milk these are just a few of the many health benefits of goat milk. not only does it contain more nutrients your body craves, but it also has less additives than cows milk. go with the healthier choice. references time magazine. great britain ghandis goat . 1931 november 2. submit your review",195,736262,fake

a hillary clinton-supporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a 20,000 donation funneled through a belize bank to use in this years presidential election campaign  until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by james okeefes project veritas action. 
suddenly, the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donations overseas origin and decided to return it. 
thats one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by okeefe called rigging the election. 
okeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with bob creamer, who was a staffer at americans united for change, a group supporting clinton for president, until the videos started appearing last week. 
he said creamer, who boasted of working directly for the clinton campaign, directed that the 20,000 donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops. 
okeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves. 
creamer was clear about his ties to clinton, stating, every morning i am on a call at 1030 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters. 
sign the precedent-setting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton! 
project veritas first video explained how the clinton campaign uses hidden connections to incite violence at donald trump rallies. its second video showed plans for step-by-step voter fraud and the third exposed prohibited communications between hillary clintons campaign, the dnc and the nonprofit americans united for change. 
the fourth video breaks down the process of the long-term investigation. it comes after creamers announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. 
okeefe and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission. 
among the revelations in the latest video was creamer was boasting of his close links to president obama. 
oh, barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics, i mean the second one, i mean the first was good, too. i was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect, he said. hes a pro, ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago. 
when asked whether a potential donor could meet obama, creamer said ok, you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in 98 days, 97. i was just at an event with him in chicago, friday of last week, he is just as good as ever. i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues, helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. i mean, for immigration reform for the  the health care bill, trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues. 
explained project veritas the more that was promised to creamer, the more access project veritas action journalists seemed to get. project veritas actions 20,000 investment paid off. the story was solid. robert creamer, scott foval, jenna price from the dnc, brad woodhouse from aufc, cesar vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous pva videos. 
in the first video, foval, a democratic operative, boasted of what he called conflict engagement, or sending protesters to disrupt trump events. 
were starting anarchy here, he said. and he needs to understand that were starting anarchy. 
in the second video, creamer explained clintons direct control over those disruption operations. 
in the end it was the candidate, hillary clinton, the future president of the united states, who wanted ducks on the ground, so by god we would get ducks on the ground, creamer said. 
creamer, the husband of democratic rep. jan schakowsky of illinois, has starred in several of the undercover videos. 
heres the third 
that video also revealed a direct conflict between what creamer was confirming  clintons active involvement in such decisions and campaigns  and the claim of her campaign manager, robby mook. 
mook told cnn over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and clinton. 
sign the precedent-setting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton! 
these individuals no longer have a relationship with the dnc, he said. theyve never had a relationship with the clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened i think in february of last year. 
they did not have a contract with the dnc until june. but putting all that aside, this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign, it is edited so we dont know what the full context is. and theres no evidence whatsoever  that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the dnc. 
his comments 
after confirming it was clinton or wanted ducks on the ground, creamer warned undercover project veritas journalists, dont repeat that to anybody. 
creamer ran democracy partners, a consulting company with ties to clinton. 
he has been to the white house 342 times while obama has been president, including 47 meetings directly with obama. 
okeefes organization reported that the coordination between the campaign, the dnc and the americans united for change smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures. 
last week , project veritas filed a complaint with the federal election commission asking for an investigation into the clinton campaigns criminal conspiracy. 
the filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means, such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally. 
the video have resulted already in two democratic operatives losing their jobs. 
editors note be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos. 
one is scott foval, who had worked for people for the american way, a george soros-funded group, and more recently with americans united for change. 
in the video, he said you know what? weve been busing people in to deal with you fing aes for 50 years, and were not going to stop now. 
also, he said he and his agents are starting anarchy by creating conflict engagement  in the lines at trump rallies. 
also out of work is creamer. 
see the second video 
talk-radio icon rush limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome. 
every trump rally would feature none of this violence unless the democrats were paying for it. i think its a big deal, folks. the media is complicit. they know who these people are.  theyre in on it. theyre part of the game.  none of its organic. none of its natural. none of its real. every bit of it is bought and paid for. 
democrats cant leave elections to chance because they know that, despite the way it may look, the majority of americans would not support them if they knew who they are.

"blums anti-empire report a collection of thoughts about american foreign policy. how will the us empire end? the anti-empire report 146 by william blum  published november 6th, 2016 l ouis xvi needed a revolution, napoleon needed two historic military defeats, the spanish empire in the new world needed multiple revolutions, the russian czar needed a communist revolution, the austro-hungarian and ottoman empires needed world war i, nazi germany needed world war ii, imperial japan needed two atomic bombs, the portuguese empire in africa needed a military coup at home, the soviet empire needed mikhail gorbachev  what will the american empire need? above nuremberg tribunal. a new one is in order to try most of the political leaders, ceos, media barons and their prostitutes, and similar agents of domination, exploitation, endless war, and imperialism for the past 100 years. i dont believe anyone will consciously launch world war iii. the situation now is more like the eve of world war i, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. ever since gorbachev naively ended the cold war, the hugely over-armed united states has been actively surrounding russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, nato expansion. at the same time, in recent years the demonization of vladimir putin has reached war propaganda levels. russians have every reason to believe that the united states is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. this mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an evil enemy make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.  diana johnstone, author of queen of chaos the misadventures of hillary clinton all in the family just pals, all of them, just pals. its all been such a joyful ride. obviously neither clinton, nor obama, or carter, find anything amiss in celebrating george w bush, one of the worst criminals in modern history. george w. bush presidential library and museum on the campus of southern methodist university in dallas, texas, april 25, 2013. official white house photo by pete souza in september 2013 president obama stood before the united nations general assembly and declared, i believe america is exceptional. the following year at the un, the president classified russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the islamic state and the ebola virus. on march 9, 2015 president barack obama declared venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states. vladimir putin, speaking at the un in 2015, addressing the united states re its foreign policy do you realize what you have done? since the end of world war 2, the united states has attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments, most of which were democratically-elected. dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries. attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders. attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries. grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries. plus  although not easily quantified  has been more

libya and somalia; from syria and pakistan. germany is taking in many syrian refugees because of its world war two guilt. what will the united states do in the future because of its guilt? but americans are not raised to feel such guilt.  the plan is for the united states to rule the world. the overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. it calls for the united states to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. it calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. it says not that the united states must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful. vice-president dick cheney  west point lecture, june 2002 two flew over the cuckoos nest we are, as a

him. many of the moves the obama administration has made in terms of its cuba policy are in lockstep with bill clintons, as expressed in the recommendations of a 1999 task force report from the council on foreign relations. the report asserted that no change in policy should have the primary effect of consolidating, or appearing to legitimize, the political status quo on the island. a successful american regime change operation in syria would cut across definite interests of the russian state. these include the likely use of syria as a new pipeline route to bring gas from qatar to the european market, thereby undercutting gazprom, russias largest corporation and biggest exporter. assads refusal to consider such a route played no small role in qatars pouring billions of dollars in arms and funds into the syrian civil war on behalf of anti-assad forces. war with russia will be nuclear. washington has prepared for it. washington has abandoned the abm treaty, created what it thinks is an abm shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit us nuclear first strike. all of this is obviously directed at russia, and the russian government knows it. how long will russia sit there waiting for washingtons first strike?  paul craig roberts, 2014 iran signed the nuclear accords with the united states earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. any iranian nuclear ambition, real or imagined, is of course a result of american hostility towards iran, and not the other way around. if the european union were an independent and rational government it would absolutely forbid any member country from stockpiling american nuclear weapons or hosting a us anti-ballistic missile site or any other military base anywhere close to russias borders. full spectrum dominance , a term the pentagon loves to use to refer to total control of the planet land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace. can you imagine any other country speaking this way? henry kissinger at the paris peace talks, september 1970. i refuse to believe that a little fourth rate power like north vietnam does not have a breaking point. in 2010, wikileaks released a cable sent to us embassies by then- secretary of state hillary clinton. she wrote this saudi arabia remains a critical financial support for al qaeda, the taliban, al nusra and other terrorist groups  worldwide. surely this resulted in at least washingtons much-favored weapon sanctions of various kinds. it did not. us general barry mccaffrey , april 2015 because so far natos reaction to putins aggression sic has been to send a handful of forces to the baltics to demonstrate resolve, which has only convinced putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. so we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest putins stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to protect russia-speaking people. for gods sake, the last time we heard that was just before hitler invaded the sudetenland. no, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1978 when the united states invaded the tiny nation of grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. it was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that didnt believe that the american empire was gods gift to humanity. since 1980, the united states has intervened in the affairs of fourteen muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. they are in chronological order iran, libya, lebanon, kuwait, iraq, somalia, bosnia, saudi arabia, afghanistan, sudan, kosovo, yemen, pakistan, and now syria. how our never-ending mideast horror began radio address of george w. bush, september 28, 2002 the iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the british government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. the regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al qaeda terrorists inside iraq. this regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year. yet  just six weeks before 911, condoleezza rice told cnn lets remember that his saddams country is divided, in effect. he does not control the northern part of his country. we are able to keep his arms from him. his military forces have not been rebuilt. the fact is that there is more participation by the cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the american population in the running of theirs. one important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the united states, exert great influence over all aspects of life. the u.s. is frantically surrounding china with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from japan, south korea and the philippines through several nearby smaller pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in australia  the u.s. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol chinas nearby waters. warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon. jack a. smith, hegemony games usa vs. prc, counterpunch crimea had never voluntarily left russia. the ussrs leader nikita khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated crimea to ukraine in 1954. crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin russia after the us-induced ukrainian coup in 2014. russian president vladimir putin refers to the ukrainian army as natos foreign legion, which does not pursue ukraines national interests. the united states, however, insists on labeling the russian action in crimea as an invasion. putin re crimeaukraine our western partners sic created the kosovo precedent with their own hands. in a situation absolutely the same as the one in crimea they recognized kosovos secession from serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a countrys central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary and the un international court of justice agreed with those arguments. thats what they said; thats what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept  and now they are complaining about crimea. why is that? paul craig roberts the absurdity of it all! even a moron knows that if russia is going to put tanks and troops into ukraine, russia will put in enough to do the job. the war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. as putin himself said some months ago, if the russian military enters ukraine, the news will not be the fate of donetsk or mauriupol, but the fall of kiev and lviv. in a major examination of us policy vis-à-vis china, published in march 2015, the authoritative council on foreign relations bluntly declared that there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, peaceful coexistence, mutual understanding, a strategic partnership, or a new type of major country relations between the united states and china. the united states, the report declares, must, therefore, develop the political will and military capabilities to deal with china to protect vital u.s. interests. john f. kennedy changed the mission of the latin american military from hemispheric defense  an outdated relic of world war ii  to internal security, which means war against the domestic population.  noam chomsky cuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an american team are not defectors, a word which has a clear political connotation. boris yeltsin was acceptable to american and europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed western capital free rein in the newly opened russian territory following the collapse of the soviet union. yeltsins era was also a time of rampant corruption by russian oligarchs who were closely associated with western capital. that corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of vladimir putin twice as president between 2000-2008, and again in 2012. many isis leaders were former iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by american troops. the fight isnt against isis, its against assad; at the next level it isnt against assad, its against putin; then, at the next level, it isnt against putin, its against the country most likely to stand in the way of us world domination, russia. and its forever. connecting to the us-based internet would mean channeling all of cubas communications directly to the nsa. george w. bush has been living a comparatively quiet life in texas, with a focus on his paintings. im trying to leave something behind, he said a couple of years ago. yeah, right, george. we can stand up some of the paintings against the large piles of iraqi dead bodies. seymour hirsch america would be much better off, if, 30 years ago, we had let russia continue its war in afghanistan  the mistake was made by the carter administration which was trying to stop the russians from their invasion sic of afghanistan. wed be better off had we let the russians beat the taliban.  deutsche welle , april 2, 2014 interview wed be even better off if we hadnt overthrown the progressive, secular afghan government, giving rise to the taliban in the first place and inciting the russians to intervene on their border lest the soviet islamic population was stirred up. the former secretary of state madeleine albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the us thinks of the un the un plays a very important role. but if we dont like it, we always have the option of following our own national security interests, which i assure you we will do if we dont like whats going on. she is now a foreign-policy advisor to hillary clinton. a leader taking his or her nation to war is as dysfunctional in the family of humankind as an abusive parent is in an individual family.  suey kane it would be some time before i fully realized that the united states sees little need for diplomacy. power is enough. only the weak rely on diplomacy  the roman empire had no need for diplomacy. nor does the united states.  boutros boutros-ghali , secretary-general of the united nations from january 1992 to december 1996 interventions are not against dictators but against those who try to distribute not against jiménez in venezuela but chávez, not against somoza in nicaragua but the sandinistas, not against batista in cuba but castro, not against pinochet in chile but allende, not against guatemala dictators but arbenz, not against the shah in iran but mossadegh, etc.  johan galtung, norwegian, principal founder of the discipline of peace and conflict studies no mention was made that iraqs christians had been safe and sound under president saddam hussein  even privileged  until president george bush invaded and destroyed iraq. we can expect the same fate for syrias christians if the protection of the assad regime is torn away by the us-engineered uprising. we will then shed crocodile tears for syrias christians.  eric margolis, 2014 jewish power is the capacity to silence the debate on jewish power.  gilad atzmon we need a trial to judge all those who bear significant responsibility for the past

dock with earphones like eichmann and make them listen to the evidence of how they killed millions of people and almost murdered the planet and made most of us far more miserable than we needed to be. of course, we wouldnt have time to go after them one by one. wed have to lump wall street investment bankers in one trial, the council on foreign relations in another, and any remaining harvard business school or yale law graduates in a third. we dont need this for retribution, only for edification. so there would be no capital punishment, but rather banishment to an overseas nike factory

occupying the uncivilized world on behalf of the powers that be. i have said that the church invented the concept of conversion by any means, including torture and killing of course, as doing the victims a big favor, since it was in the interest of saving their immortal souls. it is now called, democratization.  rita corriel it is more or less impossible to commemorate the war dead without

"miley cyrus crying over trump victory video miley cyrus crying over trump victory video 2 shares by ike mclean  november 11, 2016  politics  
after it was announced that donald trump would be the 45 th president of the united states, miley cyrus posted a video online of her crying over the results. 
with tears rolling down her face cyrus says, so, probably like most peoplewell, maybe not, because given the resultmaybe i really am different and maybe a lot of people that im surrounded by think with open minds and open hearts like i do. and i do want to say that ive been very vocal for my support for everyone besides donald trump. heavily supported bernie. heavily supported hillary. and i still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president, and thats what makes me so sad. 
i just wish that she had that opportunity. because she fought for so long and because i believe her when she says that she loves this country. this is all shes ever done. shes given her life to make it better. but, like donald trump so ironically played after his speech, it said, you cant always get what you want. and happy hippies, we adjust and we accept everyone for who they are. and so donald trump, i accept you, she said. and this hurts to say, but i even accept you as the president of the united states, and thats finebecause i think now i want to be hopeful. 
she then went on to thank barack obama for everything he has done the past eight years, and thanked hillary for inspiring us.

"trump sets gop fundraising milestone in small-donor contributions republican presidential nominee donald trump has reached a financial accomplishment that no other gop candidate has before.
he has amassed the largest small-donor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the republican party.
zac moffatt, an online fundraising expert, said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate.
 
related stories newt gingrich defends donald trump against sexual predator accusations donald trumps star on hollywood walk of fame vandalized independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio the people who donate are your core believers, said moffatt, who was digital director for mitt romneys 2012 campaign.
romney and sen. john mccain, the 2008 gop nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than trump has in total contributions.
however, trumps campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as 200 or less.
 
in this category, trump has raised more than 78.6 million thus far, based on data from the federal election commission.
in comparison, mccain raised 65.5 million and romney raised 44.8 million by this point in their election races.
while mccain and romney had significant income contributions from other sources, trumps small-donor income makes up 58 percent of his overall funds.
according to opensecrets.org, small donations are a key category because for those below 200 mark the campaigns arent legally required to register personal information on the donor, whereas if the donation exceeds 200 the campaign must give the donors name, occupation, employer and zip code.
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias, trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias you could make an argument that he is the best candidate to refresh the rncs online fundraising database because of the different kind of donor that hes gotten, said vincent harris, a gop digital strategist who did private digital work for trumps campaign.
as of oct. 19, the trump campaign ceased all events meant to raise money for the partys get-out-the-vote effort, electing instead to have trump focus on getting across his final message to voters.
weve kind of wound down, said steven mnuchin, trumps national finance chairman. but the online fundraising continues to be strong.
we have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political events, mnuchin continued. unlike democratic nominee hillary clinton, who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.
this decision has been questioned by some given that clintons campaign has raised 445.4 million, according to opensecrets, which is 226.6 million more than the 218.8 million trump has raised.
clinton has 41 events lined up before nov. 4.

"george soros funds anti-trump riots similarly to how he funded the ferguson riots does someone behind the scenes want to see civil war in the united states? 
the answer is almost certainly yes. 
and it isnt likely to settle down anytime in the next few days. if you arent prepped for this, go here to learn how to stay safe . 
just a little background this has been going on since the midst of the campaign when actors were hired on craigslist and trained to disrupt rallies. 
for example, one craigslist ad was answered by paul horner, who admitted he was paid 3,500 to cause a scene at a trump event in fountain hills, arizona. 
as for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be hillary clintons campaign, horner said. the actual check i received after i was done with the job was from a group called women are the future. after i was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who i was with or communicated with me in any way, i should start talking about how great bernie sanders is. horner continued, it was mostly women in their 60s at the interview that i went to  source  
the same report goes on to say 
when asked about the other protesters at the rally, horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally. 
almost all of the people i was protesting with i had seen at my interview and training class. at the rally, talking with some of them, i learned they only paid latinos 500, muslims 600 and african americans 750. i dont think they were looking for any asians. women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received 300 across the board. i think i was paid more than the other protesters because i was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back 
you can also read this article , in which a quote caught on video from project veritas shows how the clinton campaign caused disruptions via bird-dogging. theres a lot of evidence that someone is funding these protests. 
an eyewitness in austin, texas spotted protesters being transported by chartered coach buses. 
then there was this craigslist ad. 

there are many more tweets along these lines, but suffice it to say, suspicion is high that these, just like the clinton campaign, are rigged to manipulate the american people. why would anyone want to cause all this trouble? 
thats where the web gets tangled. it certainly seems counterproductive to set fire to america. after all, what these people are doing is likely to end up with more tyranny  like martial law, for example. 
exactly. 
thats precisely the plan. 
back in august, hackers from a group called dc leaks got into the private documents of the open society, an organization founded by george soros. soros, whom dc leaks referred to as the architect and sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years is a pro-globalist billionaire who has been trying to take over the world via shadow government for decades. 
zero hedge reported on the findings in the soros leak 
the documents are from multiple departments of soros organizations. soros the open society foundations seems to be the group with the most documents in the leak. files come from sections representing almost all geographical regions in the world, from the usa, to europe, eurasia, asia, latin, america, africa, the world bank the presidents office, as well as an unknown entity named souk. as the daily caller notes , there are documents dating from at least 2008 to 2016. documents in the leak range from research papers such as  european crisis key developments of the past 48 hours  focusing on the impact of the refugee crisis, to a document titled  the ukraine debate in germany , to an update specific financials of grants. they reveal work plans, strategies, priorities and other activities by soros, and include reports on european elections, migration and asylum in europe. an email leaked by wikileaks earlier this week showed soros had advised hillary clinton during her tenure as secretary of state on how to handle unrest in albania  advice she acted on. 
as well, its important to note that soros provided a whopping 33 million to activists in ferguson, missouri, escalating a protest to a siege. the washington times reported 
liberal billionaire george soros , who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts american politics and policy, not unlike what he did with moveon.org. 
mr. soros spurred the ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the u.s., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by the washington times. 
in all, mr. soros gave at least 33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in ferguson , according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit open society foundations everyday carry gear  11 items you should always have on you ad 
this is business as usual for the osf open society foundation, as explained by director kenneth zimmerman  
mr. zimmerman said osf has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early 90s, and that, although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of mr. soros grants, they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of open society . 
the incidents, whether in staten island, cleveland or ferguson , were spontaneous protests  we dont have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say, mr. zimmerman said. but these circumstances focused peoples attention  and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation. 
soros -sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in ferguson , building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign. 
other soros -funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep, and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive. 
the plethora of organizations involved not only shared mr. soros  funding, but they also fed off each other, using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on anothers website, referencing each others news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of facebook likes and twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds. 
soros was busted for paying protesters to go into ferguson and stir things up. this is not theory. its fact. the daily mail reported that soros spent 33 million to bankroll the protests. the washington times reported that it was totally cool, though, because humanitarian that he is, soros just wanted to help the civil rights movement . what a guy. of course, this seems to be a thing with the kabillionaires. the ford foundation and rockefeller foundation also fund social activism. which is kabillionaire code for mess stuff up and wreak havoc. 
keep in mind that the organization black lives matter was born through the ferguson riots. does this look familiar? 
if the modus operandi in these protests looks familiar, thats because moveon.org is organizing a lot of them, and moveon is funded by you guessed it george soros. the organization was originally founded to combat the impeachment of bill clintonare you seeing a link here? another proud instigator is the answer coalition which also  are you sitting down? has links to soros . 
there are a lot of people who are out there because they genuinely oppose a trump presidency. the unfortunate thing is, their opposition comes from propaganda that they passionately believe. they are acting based on misinformation and theyre being professionally manipulated. 
the next step here is martial law, which nobody wants. 
well, nobody except george soros and friends. 
someone who wants to see america ripped apart is causing this division. last summer, it was leaked that soros attempted to destabilize russia and depose putin in 2012. putin responded by banning soros and all of his organizations from russia. in 2014, putin issued an international arrest warrant for soros. 
we could certainly improve both international relationships and our current situation by extraditing soros immediately.

"first iraqi troops enter mosul, but fighting remains largely in suburbs military goal is to 'liberate' eastern bank of tigris river by jason ditz, october 31, 2016 share this 
iraqs invasion of mosul has entered its third week with a noteworthy first, as the first iraqi special forces entered the city itself in the area around karama district, in the far east. there was fighting reported both within the district and in surrounding suburbs. 
indications are that the vast majority of the fighting in the area remains in the suburbs, with only a small incursion into the city itself. still, iraqi military officials say their goal is to take the whole eastern bank of the tigris river, which divides the city. 
the area entered is near a key industrial site within mosul. it is unclear how well secured this area is from isis perspective, as theyve laid heavy traps and tunneled in around the city in anticipation of the invasion, but indications were that a lot of these defensive measures were taken in residential areas. 
isis is believed to have several thousand fighters in mosul, and with the us announcing they intend to kill anyone who tries to escape, they are likely to resist all the more fiercely, knowing they dont have any place to go after mosul. last 5 posts by jason ditz",17,736269,fake
"russia to beef up western defenses with s-400's to counteract us-nato threat november 21, 2016 - fort russ news -  rianovosti - translated by j. arnoldski -  


in response to the deployment of american missile defense systems in europe, russia is being forced to strengthen its aerospace defenses on its western borders, viktor ozerov, the chairman of the federation councils committee on defense and security, told ria novosti. 
as a responsive measure against such a type of threat, we will be compelled to strengthen our aerospace defense system in the western direction and put into operation additional forces and means for resolving the covering of relevant facilities and control points. this strengthening of forces will include the deployment of s-400 and iskander complexes in kaliningrad, as well as the creation of new formations in the western and southern military districts, the senator said. 
ozerov remarked that one of the arguments which russia has put forward in relation to the deployment of american missile systems in europe is the fear that this infrastructure could be promptly converted to accommodate strike weapons, particularly land-based cruise missiles. 
these fears are being confirmed today, ozerov stated. 
according to the senator, along with motorized infantry and tank units, the divisions being created in the western and southern military districts will include troops and anti-air defense means. in addition, we are not hiding this, we are improving our aerospace forces and developing new, modern missiles of both the land-air and air-land classes which would be capable of overwhelming the air defenses that the us has in europe, ozerov explained. 
senator ozerov added that the additional deployment of arms capable of neutralizing the us missile defense threat is a symmetrical response. according to him, russia is constantly monitoring the situation and is ready to respond. 
in may of last year, the construction of the aegis ashore facility was completed which includes american missile systems in the vicinity of the romanian town of deveselu. another such facility is to appear by 2018 in northern poland. 

moscow has repeatedly stated that the us and natos actions in deploying anti-missile defense systems in europe represent a threat to russias national security and could undermine strategic stability in the region.

if youre in one of 16 key states  including battleground states like florida and pennsylvania  make sure you double-check your ballot better yet, bypass the electronic voting machines altogether and request a paper ballot. 
why? because weve discovered that the company providing many of the voting machines for as many as 16 states  smartmatic, has deep ties to leftist globalist george soros. 
these machines were used in venezuela and have been tied to the so-called landslide victory of president hugo chavez and his supporters, wikileaks is revealing . 
since then, smartmatic bought out california-based sequoia voting systems and is now involved in american elections, the truth division is reporting . 
according to smartmatics website, in less than one year smartmatic tripled sequoias market share and has offered technology and support services to the electoral commissions of 307 counties in 16 states. 
in 2007, smartmatic announced the sale of sequoia, given the difficult climate in the united states marketplace, tainted by a non-stop debate against foreign investment, especially in the election technology area. 
their website includes a flow-chart that describes how the company has contributed to elections in the u.s. from 2006-2015 with 57,000 voting and counting machines deployed and 35 million voters assisted. 
after this reports publication, smartmatic updated its website to remove the flow chart and declare that smartmatic will not be deploying

"trump no quiere que eeuu toma parte de acuerdo de parís  us viewer trump no quiere que eeuu toma parte de acuerdo de parís 20161113 1322 twitter el mandatario electo de los estados unidos, donald trump, ya está buscando formas rápidas para que washington salga del acuerdo mundial de parís contra el cambio climático. 
usviewer, eeuu_ así informó reuters, citando a una fuente de su equipo de transición, quien reprochó al saliente presidente barack obama que firmara la adhesión del país mediante una orden ejecutiva, sin contar con el apoyo del senado. 
""fue insensato que el acuerdo de parís entrara en vigencia antes de la elección"" del martes, dijo la fuente, que habló bajo condición de anonimato. el acuerdo de parís obtuvo el 4 de noviembre el apoyo necesario para ser puesto en marcha. 
pues, según la fuente, la alternativa es enviar una carta de retiro de la convención de 1992 que está asociada al acuerdo de parís, lo que restaría la participación de estados unidos en ambos en un año, o emitir una orden presidencial que borre la firma de washington del acuerdo sellado en la capital francesa. 
muchos países se han mostrado optimistas para que ee.uu. se mantenga adherido al pacto, aunque marruecos, sede de las actuales conversaciones, dijo que el acuerdo que busca reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en la segunda mitad del siglo es lo suficientemente fuerte como para sobrevivir al éxodo estadounidense. 
el triunfo del candidato republicano a la casa blanca, donald trump, en los comicios del pasado martes, ha generado diversas reacciones tanto dentro del territorio estadounidense como en otras partes del mundo, una victoria que ha sido acogida con la satisfacción de algunos, el temor o la prudencia de otros. 
en diciembre de 2015, tras 13 días de intensa negociación en un suburbio de parís capital de francia, representantes de 195 países consiguieron el acuerdo histórico para reducir drásticamente las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en un intento por detener el calentamiento global.

"iraqi christians hold first mass in over 2 years pray for trump to win iraqi christians will pray for donald trumps election victory after they condemned us government for abandoning them to the barbaric terror of islamic state.
the christian community in the latest iraqi town to be freed from isis have opened up about how they were terrorised at the hands of the twisted jihadi militants.
the once-bustling qaraqosh, which boasted of more than 50,000 christian residents, was recaptured from the jihadis last week.
residents who stayed in the town have described how isis told every christian to pay a massive tax, convert to islam or face execution.
those who survived the terror have now voiced their outrage that president obama refused to protect them when iraqs largest christian city fell to isis more than two years ago.
a man in the village said he hopes donald trump  a widely favoured candidate in the town  will bring a different approach to iraqi christians.
he told the camera obama has never helped the christians. in fact, he despises them. in the last 26 months, he has shown he despises all of them.
but we have hope in the new president, trump.

donald trump has previously spoken up about how christians have been left to fend for themselves by the us government.
a catholic priest in the town said the us government led by president obama could have protected us  or at least helped us to protect ourselves.
but unfortunately obama abandoned us, and chose not to get involved.
a young girl wearing a crucifix then added we hope this new guy called trump will help us more than obama did.
last sunday, father ammar took mass in a shelled-out church of the immaculate conception for the first time in two years.

what counts is that we can pray here again
the church, still largely in rubble from the chaotic war, is iraqs largest and used to regularly host more than 3,000 people a week to its sunday mass
the liberation comes as kurdish-led forces fight to free both of isis largest remaining strongholds  mosul in iraq and raqqa in syria.

"this is what gold does in a currency crisis, brexit edition this is what gold does in a currency crisis, brexit edition

in june the uk shocked the world  or at least the worlds elites  by voting to pull out of the european union. economists predicted disaster, eu leaders threatened pain for british exporters and tourists, and the media settled in to watch the uk shrivel and die. 
four months later, the appropriate response is a yawn rather than a scream. uk economy set to shrug off brexit in latest gdp figuresfor now

the pound, however, did fall hard in foreign exchange markets 
which is actually great news for british exporters, who are winning round one of the post-brexit currency war by selling suddenly-much-cheaper stuff to the rest of the world.

"with donald trump tanking, a trump supporter waves her hillary in a noose doll at rally at a donald trump rally in north carolina, a proud ginger glover waved a lyin hillary doll with a special edition noose on it. 
watch a clip with glover at the wednesday rally here via nbc news  
glover said the noose was her way of making a point that hillary clinton should be incarcerated at the very least, but when asked said she doesnt think clinton should be killed. 
yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around. for effect. 
where is all of the trump rallies violent rhetoric and imagery going? 
donald trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame. 
the washington post did an incredible story on melanie austin, a trump supporter who said trump sees the world like she does. she realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to calm her, after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against president obama. 
the first time she had seen him, at a rally in june, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. at the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. she had gotten them in february, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a rant, a series of online postings that included one saying that obama should be hanged and the white house fumigated and burned to the ground. on her discharge papers, in a box labeled medical problem, a doctor had typed homicidal ideation. 
donald trump and the alt-right, and indeed way too many elected republicans, have already pointed these folks at hillary clinton and barack obama as evil people who must be harmed. when you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone, as trump and his advisers have done suggesting hillary clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad, you are responsible for inciting violence. 
things are not going well for trump supporters, and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the alt-right media and fox news, they smell defeat. 
perhaps thats not connected to this specific woman who brought a hillary clinton doll in a noose to wave at a trump rally last night, but it is a trend were seeing in general  angry trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric. 
there will be more of this, not less, as trumps likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles. 
this is political intimidation that mimics donald trumps despotic promises to jail clinton even though shes been cleared of wrong-doing in all of the relentless republican investigations into her activities as secretary of state. 
of which there will be plenty more, republicans promise us, should she win  because just like the trump camp doesnt want you to vote, republicans only want government to work when theyre not in power. 
the potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among trump supporters.

"hillary clinton maintains swing state leads as comey email letter flops by jason easley on sun, oct 30th, 2016 at 1052 am republicans hoped that fbi director james comey's letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of trump in arizona. share on twitter print this post 
the cbs news republicans hoped that fbi director james comeys letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of trump in arizona. 
battleground tracker found that by a small margin comeys letter made democrats more likely net 7 to support clinton. 
in the individual battleground states, clinton leads by eight points in pennsylvania 48-40, north carolina 48-45, and in colorado 42-39. the only state of the four polled where trump has a small two point lead in arizona 44-42. 
according to cbs news , and the larger demographic difference defining the race between clinton and donald trump has been a gender gap  slightly larger now than the last time in these states  that offsets a smaller movement of republicans to trump. 
to put it another way, hillary clintons support with women is going up at a larger rate than republican movement towards trump. 
these are the first swing state polls to be taken since fbi director comey released his now infamous letter on friday. the email story isnt moving voters. it is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. democrats are going to vote clinton. republicans are going to vote for trump, and there arent enough undecided voters to swing the election to trump. 
republicans were hoping for a hail mary touchdown to save trump, but clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day. if the comey letter is the big october surprise, it isnt working on voters.

"we are aliens because our souls are extra-terrestrial . we are aliens because our souls are extra-terrestrial we are in this physical world, but we are not from this world. it is important to understand that ...  we are in this physical world, but we are not from this world. it is important to understand that there is an evolution of souls going on through the earthly experience, but also a development for every individual soul. this is how the passage into higher and higher dimensions can be explained in simple terms. there are many immature souls on planet earth, and also many misguided souls. other souls do not possess the best intentions, or are simply controlled by beings without a body , whose intentions and evolutionary process are not commendable. many dope addicts and alcoholics have this unfavorable trait as do many selfish and greedy people.few humans, because of their inclinations or because of their immaturity allow unknowingly those beings to manipulate them from time to time. the beings i am referring to, are not yet developed as souls, nor do they possess a higher self or higher conscious awareness  only the mortal and limited intellect. this is by no way a reproach towards them, since most souls are going through a similar process of evolution on earth, where beings are not born consciously aware, unlike on some other planets. humans on earth, because of heredity, do need conscious spiritual work on themselves in order to set themselves free from their genetic compromised dna and intelligence, and clear their karma in order to ascend to higher dimensions and levels of existence. in other words, perhaps it would help to compare a developing soul on earth to that of one of earths children. when the child grows, he develops certain physical attributes, but also awareness, his feelings and understanding, his brain and endocrine system are in formation. souls undergoes a similar development; they need various experiences to mature, and develop consciousness. the universe is in perpetual growth  creation never stops. life comes under various forms, obeys various rules, and there are as many possibilities as universes. your planet has a heavy history of genetic manipulation and experimentation. your kind, the pure physical human kind, was developed around a soul, in order to experience a 3d dimension level of density, so souls had in effect to descend down the octave of creation in order to experience duality. this occurred because of the atlantean fall of your civilization the anunnaki, mankind's enslavement and the afterlife deception however, many of you have previously lived in much higher densities, but because of the fall, you had to learn to adapt to this 3d dimensional density, which was never meant to be your natural home. other souls have also volunteered to experience life in lower densities, or were sent here from higher densities in order to further their understanding of your world or of their own world or simply in order to help our prime creator on your world. these beings come from a higher plane of existence, which is their natural habitat. none of you, who are reading these messages or have a deep spiritual need, have been created in the 3d dimension, and you long to return home, where you have been created, to a higher dimension. the physical born beings will, in time, mature and become conscious enough to evolve into higher dimensions. these are the ones who are not aware of their higher self, but are given the experience here in order to make them aware of their potential. this is a natural process for all souls, as all souls will eventually make their journey back home towards our prime creator. it is important for you to comprehend also that although all humans look alike, their inner abilities vary greatly . have you also considered the fact that some civilizations are so old and advanced that they can create soulless beings? such beings are called clones or things on your world. this technology is already available to your scientists, and they can create or copy a human body, such as one would grow a plant. however, these beings do not possess a soul , because they were not created by our common creator, but are the results of mechanical genetic engineering. this is another reason why some humans would not have a higher self. while their external appearance is in no way different to that of ordinary humans, the spark of divine life force and consciousness is not inside of them. those beings have mixed their mechanical genetic material with humans having a soul, which has led to much dna damage. there are many animals which are in human form, but not all animals are beasts, nor are all beasts animals. the earths population is comprised of many souls, with many different contracts, coming from various densities of consciousness. what man mistakes for thinking is but an intellectual awareness of things sensed and recorded within the cells of his brain for repetitive usage through what is termed ""memories."" memories have no more relation to knowledge of universal mind which is in man, than a computer records are related to the source of their recordings. what he thinks of as his living body is but an obedient and motivated mechanical construct which simulates life through motion extended to it from its soul, which alone lives and wills the body to move. your physical clay body is terrestrial, but that is not you. your soul, that consciousness which you are, is that which has a temporary physical experience for its own development. the mechanical clay body you use has a conscious experience. but you are that consciousness. the physical world and anything in it cannot and never has created conscious awareness. intelligence, as found in snakes or spiders, yes, but not conscious awareness. some people think that the human body  which is flesh evolved at conscious awareness  is soul, by some totally unexplained and totally unproven method. think of that for a minute, pilgrim. common sense tells us that it is not reasonable that the human sex act can create a soul in the prime creators image, since if it was so, we would not be creations of the prime creator, but of our physical parents mortal mechanical primate bodies. the human body, which your physical parents gave you, is the vehicle you use. but you are the soul , created in the prime creators image, using the human flesh body your parents made ready for you to use. and if a soul is pre-existent, which it is, and can enter into a body at some time in the babys development stage and leave the body when it dies, then logic and reason tells us that the soul can also enter many more times. all the physical effects in your life are only the effects of the thoughts of your conscious mind. the so-called sins and evil are not in the action of what your mechanical body does, but in the thoughts that come from what you think. your soul is accountable and will reap its own harvest. all the actions and words of your body are the effects of your thoughts. countless religious and cultural teachings, as well as many different philosophies, commands us to do good, but sadly, goodness is still veiled like in a thick mist. many souls have been stumbling in darkness, scraping their knees; but worry not, for eventually they all learn to walk! soon after this dark period we live in, there will be so much light that you will have to wear shades. new information and better comprehension periodically transforms mankind into more conscious beings and a new awareness cycle  which will last for many thousands of years to come  is now commencing. the prime creators omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence are centered in the consciousness of each and every man; but there are only few who know of the oneness of their soul with the creator. man requires millennia to become aware of that. each cycle brings him nearer to the awareness of his oneness with the source. mankind lives in a bewildering complex world of effects and doesnt know the original cause . because of its seemingly infinite multiplicity and complexity, mankind fails to see or visualize the simple underlying principle of all things. he complicates truths and half-truths until its many angles, sides and facets have lost balance with each other and with him. all knowledge exists and is available. all knowledge will come to mankind in its own season, as needed. enlightened souls and messengers, periodically come and give such universal knowledge, but only when man is able to comprehend it and only that he can bear at the moment, for man is just beginning to comprehend the wholeness. when we will master enlightenment, we will know no limitations  but man must know the light within oneself, the ever present universal consciousness . and man must want to know and to experience it oneself and then no one can tell otherwise, for light knows light intuitively. mankind is aware of some of these illusions, but we are not aware of the fact that all effects are not what they seem to be. thus we are misled into forming conclusions which have no relation to nature and reality whatsoever. an intelligent person has mostly knowledge of the effect, but all real knowledge and understanding lies in the cause. new fundamental laws and principles must be based upon knowledge of the cause . what little knowledge man has acquired during these last few thousand years, has been given to us by the very few geniuses, prophets, mystics and other messengers of the light who have come to re-inspire mankind with their insight and knowledge. from these rare few, the beginnings of our culture have sprung. without them there would be no understanding of beauty in this materialistic world. without grasp of beauty man would still be living in caves. through beauty alone will man gradually become consciously aware of his oneness with the light? when man knows the light he will know all things. today, that light is so dim in all men that no one, perhaps only a few, have fathomed the secret of light, life, love, growth, reincarnation and about the third wave of souls entering now . the great unanswered questions of man have simple answers. the silent voice within every man is ceaselessly whispering it to his awakening consciousness. every desire written upon the heart of man is carried to the source of the original cause, and its answer will come, but only few ask from their heart and there are fewer still who listen. many are the ages of preparation for worthiness, for man's consciousness is insulated from his source by the sensations of his per-conditioned intellect and his selfish personal self which he wrongly thinks of as being his mind. what man calls his objective human mind intellect is mortal and the seat of both right and wrong information absorption and a multitude of vibrating sensations of his mortal body. what he calls his subjective mind is his sub-consciousness, his spiritual storehouse of memory of all-knowledge, all power, and all-presence. that consciousness is his individual self, his eternal self through which his omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence are expressed as he slowly becomes aware of their presence within him. the electrically vibrating nerve-wires which operate his bodily mechanism act almost entirely through automatic reflexes and instinctive control, and to a very little extent through mental decisions. each cell and organ of his body has an electrical awareness of its purpose and each fulfills that purpose without any mental action whatsoever upon the part of the intelligence which occupies that body. the heartbeat, for example, is purely automatic. the white corpuscles of the blood rush to repair an injury to the body as automatically as a bell rings when a button is pushed. in this body and its electric recording brain, man thinks that he thinks and lives, loves and dies. he thinks himself conscious while awake and unconscious when sleeping  unaware that in all nature there is no such condition as unconsciousness when sensation ceases in sleep. man does not say that his tooth is unconscious when it is put to sleep by short-circuiting the electric current in the nerve-wire which gives sensed electrical awareness to his tooth. he knows that his tooth cannot be conscious, but he does not know that his mechanical body cannot be conscious. nor does he yet know that consciousness never sleeps, and never changes, for consciousness in man is his immortality. man is still new. he is barely out of the dark of his jungle of ignorance. for the million or more years of his unfolding he has relied upon sensation for his actions and the evidence of his senses for his knowing. few have been aware of the spirit life force, conscious awareness in them. in this beginning of his new awareness he is confused, not knowing which is mind in him, which is consciousness in him and which is sensation. he has not yet learned that bodies are but self-created mechanisms which manifest their centering self, and that self manifests the prime creator as one with it. dolores cannon  we are living in the most important time in the history of the universe  likewise, he has not yet learned that bodies neither live nor die, but repeat themselves continuously ashes to ashes, dust to dust. and forever as all idea of mind likewise repeats itself. free will is a gift to everybody from our creator, by following orthodox religions, scriptures, man-made systems, having blind faith, or admiring individual orators blindly without pondering and wondering if the information you get is real, truthful, or not, many have abdicated their own god given free will to the will of others by being followers and joiners. they became the effects of other people instead of making their own cause by being creative, just like the prime creator. like being loving co-creators. think, make up your own mind about what is real and good and what is not! there is so much good in all of us, so use it lavishly and unselfishly toward everybody, but dont be naïve or gullible. if something doesnt make sense, it is non-sense. if you dont search, you wont find. light will not come from others, it comes from within your own consciousness  it is already there waiting to escape. there is no dead, ever. the body was never alive; it is a created machine that gets the life force and instructions from the soul consciousness that uses it  but only temporarily. yes, we are aliens  extra-terrestrials. humbly compiled in love,i am rene descartes, humansarefree.com i am still conscious, therefore i

"reason of why the fbi reopened clinton investigation decoded some of you may wonder and ask yourselves why has the fbi reopened the the clinton email case. anthony weiner is just the surface reason.
fbi director james comey saw the mutiny within the fbi with many fbi agents revolting over his decision not to prosecute hillary clinton back in july 2016.
so heres the bombshell comey decided to reopen hillarys email investigation because he is fearing that he will get arrested and put behind bars for corruption and collusion in case donald trump wins.
he reopened the case, to create an escape route in case trump wins. its quite simple actually. james comey did not provide any recent proof he stumbled upon and neither will he until the election is over. yes hes technically not allowed to but he could just indict hillary in a second if he truly wanted just for lying to the fbi or wiping the server to get rid of all the evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena.
so if hillary clinton wins, comey will simply close the case and declare that nothing was substantial after all and she dust made a mistake, just like he did before.
if donald trump wins, he will finalize the investigation and put hillary clinton behind bars, then he will tell donald trump see? i was fair and i wasnt corrupt! i did arrest her after all and i did my job! hoping to get away with what he did during the first investigation.
make no mistake about it, this isnt coincidence, comey surely fears trumps retribution, the decision to reopen the investigation came just 1 single day after trump called the fbi corrupt and called for a reopening of the investigation, see for yourself .
trump is pretty tolerant guy so this may actually work out for comey. he wrongfully forgave many people! for example, after having an conflict with paul ryan refusing to endorse trump back in the primaries, trump finally decided to forgive ryan and endorse him right before the wisconsin congress elections. if trump wasnt soft regarding some of those traitors, he would have endorsed paul nehlen instead but he didnt and it was a mistake as we now know.
comey however will have to look authentic though and he will have to prove to trump before the elections that he is truly on to something and that this isnt just a political move. dont expect for comey to go to hard because hes well aware that if he goes too hard on queen of the underworld hillary and she wins, then he will rot in jail for the rest of his life because hillary is the revengeful type.
just to prove the case that she is revengeful, look at what she did after trump slammed bill clinton as a rapist during the 2nd debate. before the 3rd debate even started, she paid a couple of skanks to go out and publically lie, falsely accuse trump of raping and groping them. during the 2nd debate she was looking at trump with hatred while he was speaking and she was looking like she was thinking to herself things similar to this ohh yeah? fk you! wait till you see what ill do to you next time! youre gonna regret this! and yes she was even seen on live tv telling trump fk you! during the 2nd debate . hillary was infuriated because trump brought bills rape victims up during that debate, but most people didnt catch it! she was clearly infuriated and already plotting revenge in her mind.
so with that said, dont expect hillary clinton to get indicted before the election. its not gonna happen. comey is a weasel appointed by obama. basically hes a democrat. the funny thing is that even though hes a democrat in disguise, fellow democrats are already calling comey traitor, russian agent and putin puppet on twitter . everyone who disagrees with them must be a russian agent these days. they really love their conspiracy theories. after all isnt john podesta interested in aliens, ufos and area 51? you cant make this stuff up. really funny stuff to watch those crazy liberals going full psycho.
but even if comey is playing on the safe side with both candidates, hillary would definitely sink her fangs into his neck for reopening the case, should she win. even if he does nothing and just closes the case after a hillary victory, she would still take her revenge. its in her character, shes revengeful and besides its a classic mafia tactic, leave no traitor alive or among your ranks. she would at the very least replace him.
additionally comey wanted to calm down an fbi which was facing a full pitchfork revolution from within with many agents being angered by this. jill mccabe, the wife of the fbi deputy director andrew mccabe who investigated hillary clinton, received a 675.000 donation bribe from hillary clinton. the agents were angry. so this move to reopen the case was also strategic with his agents. it will calm the waters down for a while. if hillary wins he will just tell the agents to go f themselves and look for a another job if they dont like it, if trump wins and comey indicts hillary after the election, the other agents will be pleased.
hillary probably has something on comey on which she could blackmail him with but it wont matter because if he will do his job and arrest hillary shortly after the election, trump will be pleased and keep him on as the director.
james comey would prefer hillary to win though because thats why he didnt indict her during the first investigation, but hes gotta defend his ass by preparing for a different scenario, like a trump victory so thats exactly why he reopened the investigation now.
trump will win in a landslide and comey will most likely be fine should he prove himself worthy before the election and actually do something.
expect more of those two-faced people to come out and do the same in the next days. expect event he likes of cnn, new york times to stop bashing trump as everyone will have to prepare for the possibility of a trump victory, out of fear of a huge retribution in case they dont change. remember those libel laws cnn?",62,736267,fake
"election crossroads socialism or capitalism? election crossroads socialism or capitalism? exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems' 'living wage' proposal published 20 mins ago jane chastain about   archive jane chastain is a southern california-based broadcaster, author and political commentator. despite her present emphasis on politics, jane always will be remembered as the nation's first female tv sportscaster, spending 17 years on the sports beat. jane blogs at janechastain.com. she is a pilot who lives on a private runway. print 
our country is at a crossroads. never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. one road, the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. the other, favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward free-market capitalism. 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. in this system they control the lions share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. in this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. as the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hard-earned money he or she spends. yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the free-market system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. no, it isnt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard. there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around 85,000 a year in some parts of the country. the democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. 
ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. 
unfortunately, this so-called living wage will destroy jobs. it will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness. 
this, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. 
wages have remained flat for far too long, but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes. they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as weve seen in obamacare, there is a large outcry. thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut. 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. our benevolent government will take care of us. they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. and if we dont get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. under president hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. what a country! 
if we dont reach our goals, everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isnt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke? how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses? they never talk about that. 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said, the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money. 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. the other offers a free lunch.

"new report uncovers secret trump server that repeatedly communicated with russia by sean colarossi on mon, oct 31st, 2016 at 847 pm while the media continues to focus on the clinton email non-story, news about donald trump's ties to russia continues to gain steam. share on twitter print this post 
while the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a non-story  fbi director james comeys vague letter regarding more emails related to hillary clinton  news about donald trumps ties to russia continues to gain steam. 
not only did nbc just report that the fbi is now in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps ex-campaign managers connection to russia, but slate also reported on monday that a trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a russian bank. 
slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the russian cyber attack of the dnc, they stumbled onto something unexpectedly. 
the report 
in late july, one of these scientistswho asked to be referred to as tea leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their datafound what looked like malware emanating from russia. the destination domain had trump in its name, which of course attracted tea leaves attention. but his discovery of the data was pure happenstancea surprising needle in a large haystack of dns lookups on his screen. i have an outlier here that connects to russia in a strange way, he wrote in his notes. he couldnt quite figure it out at first. but what he saw was a bank in moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the trump organization on fifth avenue. 
more data was needed, so he began carefully keeping logs of the trump servers dns activity. as he collected the logs, he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world. six of them began scrutinizing them for clues. 
the researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. the communication wasnt the work of bots. the irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversationconversations that began during office hours in new york and continued during office hours in moscow. it dawned on the researchers that this wasnt an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called alfa bank. 
this news doesnt come out of nowhere. trump has repeatedly praised vladimir putin as a strong leader, all while taking pro-russia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a kremlin wishlist. 
the clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by clinton senior policy adviser jake sullivan 
this secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of trumps ties to russia. it certainly seems the trump organization felt it had something to hide, given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists. 
this line of communication may help explain trumps bizarre adoration of vladimir putin and endorsement of so many pro-kremlin positions throughout this campaign. it raises even more troubling questions in light of russias masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt hillary clintons campaign. we can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between trump and russia as part of their existing probe into russias meddling in our elections. 
trumps pro-russia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence. the more information that comes out, the clearer it is that the republican nominee has connections to russia that he is hiding from voters. 
with just a week until election day, this is the explosive story the media should be focusing on. its critical that the american people know what kind of financial ties a potential president has with an american adversary, especially when that adversary is russia.",133,736269,real

did huma create the âlife insuranceâ folder to use as leverage, just in case her boss, hillary clinton, ever turned on her? or, did anthony weiner create the folder, for his own bargaining options? so did huma steal 10,000 emails and saved it on her comp just in case clinton targeted her?

many u.s. muslims prefer sharia law 
washington d.c.  usa  president elect, donald trump has today made his plans for muslims in america known to reporters. 

donald trump visited the white house today to meet with outgoing president barack hussein obama on plans for the transference of power. to say the meeting was edgy and cold would be an understatement. 
trumps landslide victory at the recent u.s. elections caught many off guard, and liberals are all still in deep shock that their delegate hillary clinton was not elected. 
after the meeting at the white house, when asked about muslims, trump was at first hesitant about revealing his plans, but then answered emphatically that muslims are a danger to the national security of the nation. 
no sharia 
i have already spoken in depth about muslims. our solution will be humane and just. their religion is abhorrent and cannot be trusted. we cannot trust muslims in our cities, our streets, our jobs. look what happened in the san bernardino shooting or the orlando massacre? these atrocities were all committed by muslims on u.s. citizens going about their daily lives. we cant have this savagery amongst us. thats why im calling for every muslim to be registered in a database. we need to find out who the devout ones are, who the others are. we need to know if they own guns, and we need to stop their permits. we need to know and watch every muslim in this country, and when the time comes i will make the final decision. we need to detain them until all the attacks stop. detain or deport. well give them a choice. lets not forget their mosques either, shut them down, we can and will do that. they have no place in america, a christian god loving country. 
another reporter asked about muslims who wish to visit the united states. 
its common sense. we have no choice. there is already a no-fly list in place for known terrorists and criminals. our policy in the name of homeland security will be that all muslims are potential terrorists. until the war of terror is over, this will be our policy. they can go and visit some other country, but muslims will not be welcome in america while i am president. 
as reporters rushed to ask further questions, trump halted them and moved on with his entourage. 
there are fears for many muslims in america today, as attacks on their person have risen by 25 already since trumps election victory. many are now making plans to leave of their own volition. share on",41,736279,fake

in a decade on the house financial services committee keith ellison hasnt targeted the credit card racketeers, or the banksters who flooded the market with predatory home and student loans or federal officials who refuse to relieve underwater homeowners. democratic party leaders need another empty black face to front the dnc, someone who blames wikileaks and the russians for hillarys defeat. ellison will do just fine. keith ellison as dnc chair another high place, another empty black face a black agenda radio commentary by bar managing editor bruce a. dixon 
in the wake of donald trumps election, democratic party honchos are scrambling to reassure their funders and to shore up the careers of democratic elected officials who serve those funders. they must justify and retain whatever hold they still have on the millions of nominal democratic voters who actually have no voice whatsoever in what their party stands for. 
at bottom, the two capitalist parties are owned by the same class of elite one percenter funders but with different voting bases at least one us party is always the self-declared white mans party. since the late sixties republicans have reserved that slot for themselves, leaving democrats to claim the allegiance of racial minorities and some other groups. the different voting bases of the two parties mean they have different campaign styles, but when the campaigns are over theyre both as barack obama affirmed, on the same team. both parties deliver the mandate of their constituencies to their common funders, big ag, big oil, big insurance, big pharma, big real estate, the military contractors and wall street. 
after the departures of debbie wasserman-schulz and donna brazile, both deeply implicated in the sabotaging of bernie sanders and hillary clintons loss, democrats need a new face at the head of the democratic national committee, the national partys executive body. ideally it should be someone who reassures the funders and can help rally the base voters. the leading contender is keith ellison, just elected to his sixth term in congress from minneapolis. 
keith ellison seems a good fit. he was the first muslim ever elected to congress, a member of the congressional black caucus and current co-chair of the large and virtually impotent house progressive caucus. he was an early endorser of bernie sanders who did his duty trying to lead leftward strays back into hillarys big tent . in a decade on the house financial services committee, ellison managed not to deeply offend the banksters who flooded the market with predatory housing and student loans, or the payday lenders and credit card racketeers, and he didnt embarrass or insult the colleagues who openly shill for them. in that target rich environment ellison managed not just to keep from hitting anything, but not even to take aim. 
by contrast, senator elizabeth warren in 2014 made headlines when she grilled ellison's former congressional black caucus colleague mel watt , on why the agency he heads, despite a clear mandate from congress to reduce the principals on potentially millions of unpayable predatory home loans, refused to reduce the principal on a single one. three years later the news is that the agency may reduce principal on a mere 3,100 home loans at most . were still waiting to hear from ellison and the other eight black democrats on the committee on this failure. 
but ellison is black. hes the first muslim elected to congress, hes smart enough and telegenic. he votes infallibly to support the apartheid regime in israel, and he says if it were up to him thered have been a no-fly zone and possible shooting war with the russians a long time ago. 
hillarys indispensable firewall was supposed to be the black vote, for which she needed to do little else than mumble about black lives mattering and pose occasionally with the mothers of some of those murdered by police. democratic shot callers seem to still believe that all they need is another empty black face in a high place. they wont get another first black president. it was hillarys turn and that didnt work out. now its keith ellisons another empty black face in a very high place.

"our consciousness is part of the material world leave a reply 
dylan harper  the human aura is an electromagnetic field that emits from any living thing. it is comprised of many layers, with each aura layer having its own function or role. an aura is not separate from the physical body but is an extension of it in different composition. 
to compare, the characteristics of planet earth include physical and atmospheric layers. the attributes of each layer are different in likeness, appearance and function; each is an interconnected part incorporating the entity as entirely complete. 
continuing to use the earth as a working example of how the human aura serves to function, its layers interactively exchange information with each other. the layers serve as a system of feedback and can indicate states of health, patterns of activity, stagnancy and warn of forthcoming ailments or disease. 
as the earth becomes more densely polluted, sections of its atmosphere will suggest the presence of ailment. by observing patterns of the wind, temperature, air flow and pressure, it allows for accurate predictions of stormy weather between different zones. our awareness or neglect of this system of feedback can mean the difference between preventive maintenance and a result that is costly in damage. all of this information can be detected through observation of atmospheric changes. 
human auras are similar  the aura layers relay specific feedback between our physical body and its functioning systems, our mental and emotional states of being, and they exchange information with other auras that we interact with. 
using the aura as a more direct way to gauge health has been snubbed in the past because auras were not readily seen or were still thought of by many as mythical apparitions. 
however, present technology now has the capability to detect and record the human energy field, and the existence of auras is becoming more widely accepted as an authentic physiological marvel. 
documented research on the physics of the aura phenomenon has been ongoing since as early as the year 1777. modern notable research carried out by dr. seymon kirlian in 1939, for which kirlian photography has been coined, openly made the controversial claims of their existence, exhibiting photographic proof of auras through his technique of electrophotography. 
more studies were done to further advance our knowledge about what the presence of this energy field means, how it functions and how to analyze what it does. united states scientist, dr. thelma moss, author of the body electric, led uclas parapsychology laboratory during the 1970s to study kirlian photography in an effort to document and explain the aura images that are present in an electrophotograph. 
at present, dr. konstantin korotkov at the russian university, st. petersburg state technical university of informational technologies, mechanics and optics, uses a process called gdv gas discharge visualization, a development in aura detection technology based on the kirlian effect. 
we are developing the idea that our consciousness is part of the material world and that with our consciousness we can directly influence our world, said dr. konstantin korotkov, a professor of physics at st. petersburg state technical university. 
to bridge our understanding of the unseen world of energy, scientific experiments are being carried out using a technique called bioelectrophotography. the assumption is that we are constantly emitting energy. bioelectrophotography aims to capture these energy fields seen as a light around the body  or what some people would call your aura. 
in 1999 the russian academy of science approved korotkovs methods and use of gdv techniques and equipment for use in hospitals and athletic training programs as a means of detecting stress in the body to apply preventative measures. sf source dreamcatcher reality nov. 2016 share this",162,736275,fake

"life everyday hero this woman woke up and went to work today thirty-two-year-old samantha collins she may not look like your typical hero, but her incredible story is one you absolutely need to read right now. against all odds, this courageous young woman woke up and went to work today. 
amazing! we should all strive to be as fearless as samantha. 
when her alarm sounded this morning at 6 a.m., samantha dug deep and did something unbelievable summoning all the willpower she had, she somehow found the strength inside herself to pull back her sheets and put two feet on the floor as if this were any other day! 
samantha then headed straight into the shower, where she miraculously managed to shampoo her hair, turn off the water, and even get dressed for work before resolutely grabbing a granola bar as she headed out the door. 
her remarkable heroism didnt stop there. defying all her basic instincts, samantha was soon sitting on a bus while it drove in the direction of her office! faced with a situation where other women might have given up, samantha bravely stood up, pressed the button to request her stop, and even had the conviction to get off the bus when it came to a halt! 
this womans courage and determination should be an inspiration to us all. 
as if this story werent already inspiring enough, samantha then went to all three of her morning meetings, battling through intermittent waves of nausea and behaving as if nothing at all had changed since last night. 
incredible! the world could use a few more heroes like samantha who refuse to let anything stop them from going through the motions, returning home, and getting ready to do it all again every day for at least the next four years. keep fighting the good fight, samantha!",30,736277,fake
"inner earth glows like in the movie avatar can there be light below the surface of the earth, without any exposure to the sun? surprisingly, the answer is yes. by robert sepehr
bioluminescent organisms have the ability to glow almost like magic. many organisms use their natural ability to produce light to trick predators, to attract mates and even to communicate.
the word for this seemingly magical ability is called bioluminescence, which comes from bio, meaning life, and lumin, meaning light.
most of these organisms, such as plankton, glow blue, but a few glow red, green, or orange. some tiny animal plankton zooplankton are big enough to see with the unaided eye.

most bioluminescent zooplankton dont glow in the dark themselves, but instead squirt globs of glowing chemicals into the water.
some zooplankton use bioluminescence to attract a mate, or to form reproductive swarms. not only is natures biochemistry fascinating, it can also be extremely beautiful, especially given the backdrop of a dark, misty cave.
glow worm is the common name for various groups of insect larvae and adult larviform females that glow through bioluminescence. they may sometimes resemble worms, but are actually insects.
the glow they produce, through by a chemical reaction, is incredibly efficient; nearly 100 of the energy input is turned into light compare this to the best light-emitting diodes at just 24.
australia and new zealand have some of the most spectacular caves, where one can go on guided tours to witness this natural phenomenon up close. see video below
why do some mushrooms emit light? making light isnt common in fungi; scientists have described about 100,000 fungal species, and only 75 glow. lab work has shown that the glow did not happen randomly or by accident.
scientists found that these mushrooms made light mostly at night, so experiments were conducted to determine why.
according to studies  referenced in the book , in dark environments, bioluminescent fruit bodies may be at an advantage by attracting insects and other arthropods that could help disperse their spores.
conditions that affect the growth of fungi, such as ph, light and temperature, have been found to influence bioluminescence, suggesting a link between metabolic activity and fungal bioluminescence.

the diversity of creatures with this ability is equally astonishing, from algae and the common firefly to deep-sea dwellers that are rarely seen by humans.
whats also fascinating is that many of these creatures are not closely related, and bioluminescent traits have seemingly evolved separately at least 30 times.
with countless well lit subterranean caves and glowing caverns, it makes one wonder what could be dwelling in vast unexplored areas under the crust.
the idea that our planet consists of a hollow, or honeycombed, interior is not new. some of the oldest cultures speak of civilizations inside of vast cavern-cities, within the bowels of the earth.
according to certain buddhist and hindu traditions, secret tunnels connect tibet with a subterranean paradise, and they call this legendary underworld agartha.
in india, this underground oasis is best known by its sanskrit name, shambhala, thought to mean place of tranquility.
mythologies throughout the world, from north and south america to europe and the arctic, describe numerous entrances to these fabled inner kingdoms.
many occult organizations, esoteric authors, and secret societies concur with these myths and legends of subterranean inhabitants, who are the remnants of antediluvian civilizations, which sought refuge in hollow caverns inside the earth.
assuming that the myths are true, and the earth is partially hollow, how could life survive underground? how would organisms receive the ventilation required to breathe miles below the surface?
surface trees and rainforests are responsible for less than one-third of the earths oxygen, while marine plants, such as phytoplankton, are responsible for between 70 to 80 percent of the oxygen in the earths atmosphere. the vast majority of our oxygen comes from aquatic organisms.
phytoplankton, kelp, and algae produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, a process which converts carbon dioxide and light into sugars which are then used for energy.
phytoplankton is responsible for half of earths oxygen
while the process of photosynthesis usually implies the presence of sunlight, the sun is not the only available light or energy source able to power photosynthesis.
before the discovery of hydrothermal vents, and their ecosystems, scientists believed that only small animals lived at the ocean bottom, in seafloor sediments.
they theorized that these animals received their food from above, because the established model of the marine food chain depended on sunlight and photosynthesis, just as the food chain on land does.
mainstream academia taught that this was the only way life could survive in the darkness of the deep seafloor. the discovery of hydrothermal vents changed all that.
it became clear that vast communities of animals grew quickly and to larger than expected sizes in the depths without the aid of the sun.
instead of using light to create organic material photosynthesis, microorganisms at the bottom of the food chain at hydrothermal vents used chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis.
at the seafloor, there are thriving ecosystems that receive energy not from the sun, but from the heat and chemicals provided by the planet itself.
for many thousands of species dwelling in the deep, the energy to sustain life does not flow down from above, but comes up from the interior of the earth.
even in the unlikely scenario where every single tree were chopped down, we would still be able to breathe thanks to aquatic plant-life ex. algae.
the earth has a tremendous amount of water, and these oceans, rivers, and lakes are teeming with numerous species of biologically active, oxygen-producing organisms.
are there any known sources of sustenance available that could provide for a large human population?
what evidence is there that a sustainable biosphere could exist miles below the surface, totally isolated from the nourishment and the established life cycle provided by the sun?
where are the entrances to inner earth, and which races live inside?
author and anthropologist, robert sepehr , explores these questions and attempts to unlock their riddles, which have eluded any consideration in mainstream academia.
numerous endeavors have been undertaken to access the interior of the earth.
polar expeditions and battles, such as operation highjump, still remain largely classified, and have been shrouded in secrecy for decades, but scientific revelations validating the rumors surrounding these covert events, and their implications, are finally being exposed to daylight.
what are the mysteries of inner earth?

a youtube video that's making the rounds appears to show a man being beaten and robbed in the middle of the street by a group laughing and shouting that he voted for trump. 
in the clip below, what appears to be a middle-aged white man is on the ground while two younger black males are hitting and kicking him in the head. the camera person yells, ""happens when you vote trump, dummy,"" while a woman next to him shouts, ""you voted trump? you voted trump? damn! yeah, he voted trump! damn!"" 


the man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. 
""get out of my car,"" the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, ""you're gonna pay for my shit!"" one of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. 
the camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, ""beat his ass! don't vote trump! don't vote trump!"" 
the video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive. 
in the longer version of the video below posted on twitter, one of the attackers gets into the driver's seat and closes the door. the beaten trump supporter stands at the car window, presumably telling the thief to get out, as the woman starts to punch him in the back of the head and is joined by the second attacker. 
the criminal then hits the gas and takes off in the car as the man desperately holds on from outside through the rear door's window while being dragged through the streets.

whatever happens on november 8, donald trump can claim this achievement his candidacy exposed the fact that the two-party system of democrats and republicans is an illusion.

as the daily bell observes 
there is only one party pro-war and pro-technocratic corporatist. 
the fundamental mythology of us politics is that the democrats are socialist-oriented and republicans believe in freedom and individual human rights. 
but hillary is corporatist, not socialist. 
important republicans call trumps stances brutal, substantively incoherent, and authoritarian. 
strangely, hillarys actions and statements provide evidence of the very authoritarianism and brutality that trump is being accused of. 
when she and her husband entered the white house, one of the very first things hillary did was fire the staff of the travel office in order to put her own people in place. 
she didnt just fire the staff however, she also tried to get the head of the office, director billy dale, put in jail for embezzlement. he was subsequently found not guilty and hillary herself was investigated for initiating the firings and making false accusations. 
her intimidation and blackmailing of her husbands lovers is well known by this point- and thus her campaigns emphasis on womens rights is ironic to say the least. 
her voting record and statements reveal an individual who is most comfortable with us serial wars abroad, no matter the reason or lack of reasons. 
additional accusations against hillary and her husband include violence and even murder of individuals whose interests diverged from theirs. 
most notably, hillary has been accused of orchestrating the death of deputy white house counsel vince foster. 
none of this seems to register with republicans who are crossing over. 
conclusion whatever else takes place during this federal election, the disintegration of the credibility of the two-party system is perhaps the most important development of all.

if rep. murphy can beat sen. rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to rubios national political career or at least force the florida republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. 
democrats have a real chance to send marco rubio to the unemployment line. rubio has been a disinterested senator, who just like ted cruz, seems only interest in his senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions. rubio has provided poor service to his constituents , and doesnt deserve to return to the us senate. 
sen. rubio has refused to commit to serving his full senate term, which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them. 
democrats have a chance to solidify their potential senate majority by sending marco rubio home. with cash to spend and less than two weeks left in the campaign, theyd be foolish not to take it.

"wallonia caves in? belgium reaches secret eu-canada trade deal compromise thu, 27 oct 2016 1645 utc  yves herman  reuters the belgian government has reached a deal with the wallonia region on the free trade agreement between the european union and canada, according to belgian prime minister charles michel. michel said ""an agreement"" was found after a last minute round of negotiations with belgium's french-speaking community who have been holding up the deal. brussels has not released the details of the compromise. the signing of the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta was cancelled on thursday after the deal was blocked by wallonia's regional parliament. comment belgium's wallonia region defying eu junker's ceta trade deal canadian prime minister justin trudeau was forced to cancel thursday's trip to brussels as the negotiations had stalled. wallonia premier paul magnette said the region was not opposed to an eu trade deal with canada. however, he insisted the secret arbitration scheme allowing corporations to sue governments had to be dropped from the agreement. regional leaders in wallonia voted 46 to 16 against ceta over fears of job losses due to cheaper farming and industrial imports. ceta promises to eliminate tariffs on 98 percent of goods immediately after ratification and also encompasses regulatory cooperation, shipping, sustainable development and access to government tenders. ceta's supporters say the deal would yield billions in added trade through customs and tariff cuts and other measures facilitating business ties. opponents claim the trade deal will only benefit the wealthy and large corporations. for ceta to be ratified, all 28 european union countries have to agree the treaty. until now, belgium has been the main obstacle to the free trade deal.

"limbaugh democrats would 'destroy jesus christ' actor jim caviezel portraying jesus in the passion of the christ. 
jesus christ of nazareth is not the republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
but if he were, democrats would try to destroy him in the same manner theyre attacking the 2016 gop candidate, donald trump. 
thats according to radio host rush limbaugh, who hypothesized what this years race would look like if the son of god were at the top of the republican ticket. 
should president trump try to prosecute hillary? sign the hottest petition in america now to show your support! 
it doesnt matter who the republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment trumps getting. it wouldnt have mattered, limbaugh said wednesday. 
they would go out of their way to find ways to destroy jesus christ if he could be nominated as a republican. the democrats would do everything they could, include calling him a liar, the bible a fake book, whatever it took. rush limbaugh 
and despite the fact the bible never indicates jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, limbaugh suggested democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of his offspring 
they would scour the historical record looking for children he had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit jesus. thats who they are. thats what they would do. 
limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that republicans would never escape this kind of media assault based on who we nominate. donald trumps rnc acceptance speech photo screenshot from rnc live feed 
i say this because a lot of you never trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like trump. no, its exactly what you get when you nominate a republican. whenever there is any opposition to the democrats, this is what they do. it doesnt matter. theyre gonna do it. they did it to romney  
ive made this point til i blue in the face. they turned romney, who is mild-mannered mr. gosh, cant even get noticed into the biggest walking satan, el diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick so this is why i think trump has so many people supporting him. hes fighting back against it when most republicans havent and dont. 
as an example of how media treatment of republicans has not changed, limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from cbs. commentator bill moyers characterized the race before it was known that republican ronald reagan would easily defeat democrat jimmy carter. moyers stated 
those of you who might speak spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember, said carter, whos been your friend. and there under the california sun in san diego at a shopping center, ronald reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which hes been a master since his days at eureka college. suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their era signs. reagan took his cue and snapped back, aw, shut up! 
and thousands of supporters roared their approval. those are the people for whom ronald reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. jimmy carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, enoughs enough. 
does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world? limbaugh asked. not an iota!

"illegal immigrant advocates pledge to resist deportation under trump email 
following the surprisingly strong electoral victory of donald trump to the white house in this years presidential election, a spokesperson for a group founded to revive the rejected 2007 dream atct  which would have granted amnesty to minors illegally in the united states  pledged to resist mass deportation of illegal aliens. the spokesperson also called border patrol cbp and immigration and customs enforcement ice personnel ""agents of racism. 
in a statement quoted by the washington times , cristina jimenez, co-founder of united we dream which describes itself as the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the nation said immigrants are declaring a state of urgency and resilience. over the coming weeks, our families and community members will need to tap into the incredible strength that brought us to this country and which we use to survive. 
in her statement, jimenez not only expressed dismay at the election of trump but also castigated the agents of the federal agencies charged with protecting our borders. 
all people with love in our hearts are angered and disappointed tonight and pledge to resist mass deportation, she said. ice and cbp have proven themselves to be agents of racism and agents of hate. 
both the national border patrol council nbpc and the national immigration and customs enforcement ice council  the two unions that represent border patrol and ice agents, respectively, had announced endorsements of trump during the presidential campaign. 
we reported in our article last april that the nbpcs leaders  including brandon judd, the unions president; kenneth palinkas, its past president; shawn moran; the unions vice president; and chris cabrera, a spokesperson for the nbpcs rio grande valley council  have all been vocal in criticizing the obama administrations lack of enforcement of our nations immigration laws. 
the nbpc issued a press release on march 30 that stated part of the reason for its endorsement of trump mr. trump is correct when he says immigration wouldnt be at the forefront of this presidential campaign if months ago he hadnt made some bold and necessary statements. and when the withering media storm ensued he did not back down one iota. that tells you the measure of a man. when the so-called experts said he was too brash and outspoken, and that he would fade away, they were proven wrong. we are confident they will be proven wrong again in november when he becomes president of the united states. 
the union representing the nations immigration and customs enforcement officers and staff, the ice council, endorsed trump last september. their endorsement statement noted donald trump reached out to us for a meeting, sat down with me to discuss his goals for enforcement, and pledged to support ice officers, our nations laws and our members. in his immigration policy, he has outlined core policies needed to restore immigration security including support for increased interior enforcement and border security, an end to sanctuary cities, an end to catch-and-release, mandatory detainers, and the canceling of executive amnesty and non-enforcement directives. 
a notice on the united we dream website stated that when the dream act failed to get 60 votes in the senate in 2007, a group of dreamers, organizers, and advocates came together to reflect on the dream act campaign and talk about building a movement and organization that would not hinge on votes in congress. 
president obama, frustrated that the dream act the development, relief, and education for alien minors act had repeatedly failed to pass, had already decided to bypass congress by creating the daca deferred action for childhood arrivals program to allow youth who had brought into the country illegally by their parents as children immigrants to work legally in the united states. 
critics of daca have pointed out that the program is a means to circumvent congress and grant amnesty to those who reside here illegally. 
the daca program was created in 2012 via policy memo by then-secretary of homeland security janet napolitano. in 2014, homeland security secretary jeh johnson further expanded the daca program by removing its age cap and extending the work authorization to three years. subsequently a group of states challenged this executive action in the case of state of texas, et al v united states, et al. 
the daca program was brought to a halt after u.s. district judge andrew hanen of the u.s. district court for the southern district of texas responded to the plaintiff states by issuing an order of temporary injunction to block the federal government from implementing the obama administrations policy memorandums that expanded daca and implemented the deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents dapa program. 
the obama administration appealed hanens ruing in a case that went all the way to the supreme court. after the court issued a tied 8-8 decision on the appeal, hanens injunction was allowed to stand. 
with the election of donald trump, it is expected that the new president will issue an executive order of his own to reverse those issued by obama administration officials to create daca. it is the anticipation of this move that has groups such as united we dream worried.

"loretta lynch takes on 'killer cops' -- except in d.c. print 
have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own? 
for the federal government, its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. 
you will recall, of course, how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. 
now loretta lynch, his successor, also known as hillary clintons guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington. 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians, she reported this month. 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations, lynch said. in the days ahead, the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve. 
the irony here is thick, indeed. 
one of lynchs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. 
meanwhile, lynch presides over the most egregious cover-up of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital. 
lynch wants reports? 
so does wnd, which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey. unfortunately, lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the 92-page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation. this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have, based on the evidence. why officers used deadly force. whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave., maryland ave. and 2nd street. only stills have been released. video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger, as doj claimed, when he fired fatal shot to careys head. not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer, as the doj claimed. police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey, two from the capitol police and two from the secret service. not one statement from those officers was in the report. their names were also redacted. redacted information an attorney in the washington, d.c., mayors office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. it turned out much more was redacted than names. the report was riddled with blacked-out sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. some of the blacked-out pages just included a heading marked evidence. some just had a date. witness statements an astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. the police report stated there were seventy-two 72 witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings. copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review. copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad. of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to wnd, leaving 38 missing. statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk. white house guard post video stills were released but not the video. it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up; whether she tried to drive around the off-duty guard who dragged a gate in front of her; and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material. also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters. ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. 
i could go on and on. for people who want facts and reports, the u.s. justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. 
weve been at this for a long time  years. yet the stonewall and cover-up of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that?

"ashton kutcher rescues 6,000 sex trafficking victims, arrests over 2,000 traffickers video christopher ashton kutcher is a well-known figure in the american entertainment industry. apart from acting, kutcher is also an investor. a venture capitalist, kutcher has successfully invested in several high technology startups with some of his investments including skype, foursquare, airbnb, path and fab.com. but despite being a businessman and a public figure, societal problems are dear to his heart. in 2008, kutcher and his ex-wife, demi moore decided to tackle one of the more serious crimes facing our modern world  humansex trafficking.
by basic definition, human trafficking is the trade of humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. the trade is a modern form of slavery . it involves controlling a person through force, fraud, or coercion to exploit the victim. over the years, the united nations, international non-governmental organizations, human rights activists, and individuals have all stepped up efforts in order to end the trade. however, due to the high rate of unemployment and rising poverty levels in some nations, the trade is still secretly thriving.
also, with the rise of the internet and technology, it is becoming increasingly easy for traffickers to lure people, especially young girls, into the dirty business. mostly, traffickers will hide on the deep web, using sophisticated gadgets to carry out their trade.
kutcher and moore decided to concentrate their efforts on the internet, to thwart the trade of the traffickers. they set up an organization called thorn. thorns mission is very simple to eliminate sex-trafficking and child exploitation over the internet.
with the help of around 20 technology companies, they set up the thorn task technical force. technology companies such as facebook, google, twitter, yahoo!, snapchat and imgur are all part of this task force.
they dedicate their time and resources to searching the darker corners of the internet, hunting out traffickers who have been involving in trafficking innocent people. since establishing thorn in 2008, the organization has so far, identified and rescued over 6,000 trafficking victims and captured over 2,000 traffickers  many of which are now in the process of facing criminal charges.",16,736266,fake
"hillarys healthcare fix exposed, millions of americans will end up dead share this 
dont be deceived by hillary clintons lie that shell fix obamacare. she already tried to fix healthcare in 1994 when president bill clinton put her in charge of transforming our healthcare and insurance plans. she called it hillarycare, and like obamacare, it failed miserably. now, her plans for obamacare have been exposed  along with how millions of americans will end up dead thanks to her fix. 
hillary clinton is a very dangerous woman. the one thing that scares healthcare professionals is her plans to fix obamacare, which is falling apart with premiums going through the roof. it was always going to fail. 
as a registered nurse for over 20 years, working in the inner city in los angeles, i saw firsthand how health care works. when barack obama and his democratic minions passed obamacare in 2010, i freaked out, knowing this would bring untimely deaths to many of my fellow americans, and now that hillary says shell fix obamacare, i can be silent no more. hillary promises to fix obamacare with full blown socialized medicine 
the first thing you need to realize is that obamacare was never the ultimate plan. it was meant to be a step toward total socialized medicine. hillary will put obamacare on steroids, and the goal is for a complete government controlled system that every american is enrolled in, where that is the only choice you have. 
this is the same system that plagues canada and great britain, and it means americans will die. instead of your doctor deciding what type of care you get, there are strict guidelines which all doctors must follow. if you are a woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you will only be given one path to take. you will not be allowed to find out about cutting edge drugs or treatments. you will be sent home to die. kathleen sebelius said, under obamacare, someone lives and someone dies. 
under socialized medicine, its all about cost effectiveness, and ovarian cancer has a high death rate. so, youre not worth the expensive treatment that may cure you or help you live longer. you wont even know those treatments exist. theyll pat you on the head, say how sorry they are, and tell you that they will do everything they can to keep you comfortable. 
this wont affect the ultra-rich. this will affect the lower and middle class, who cant afford to seek treatment on their own. 
socialized medicine will affect even happy events like having a baby. in keeping with the culture of death that surrounds socialized medicine, heres what happened to one mother in great britain whose baby was born at 22 weeks  an age at which some infants have survived when life-saving measures were used. tracy goodwin watched in horror as they let her baby die. 
forty-six minutes later after he was born, and despite her desperate pleas to midwives for assistance, miss godwins son died as she held him. 
she has since been told that the hospital has a policy not to resuscitate babies born earlier than 24 weeks into pregnancy. via daily mail  tracy goodwin left holds her baby boy, born at 22 weeks right. 
if you need to see a doctor, good luck. in canada, they have to wait 3-4 months just to see their primary care physician. canadians wait on average 35 weeks, or 6 months, to see a specialist after getting a referral, according to the fraser institue . if you have cancer, you could be dead by the time you can see an oncologist. 
this is why most doctors and nurses are fleeing healthcare. we can no longer help our patients the right way, with clear consciences, and those doctors and nurses who support this kind of system are lying to themselves into believing that this system is healthcare. its managed deathcare, and that is what big brother does best. 
whats the answer? donald trump . he will repeal obamacare, and even if he does nothing else, its a win. he is putting healthcare back into the free market where it belongs. what drives insurance prices down? competition  and that is what he will do when he opens up buying healthcare across state lines. 
lastly, a brain surgeon should be paid more than a truck driver, no offense to truck drivers. yet, under socialized medicine, doctors are made to take a salary which is capped. this, in itself, does not give our smartest kids any incentive to become a brain surgeon. making a lot of money drives those interested in medicine to become doctors. its just a fact, and it made our healthcare system the best in the world before obama came along. 
back in 1994, hillary tried to pass socialized medicine called hillarycare, and it failed. now, she is back, promising to fix obamacare with hillarycare, but if you value your loved ones lives, there is only one thing to do. make sure people realize what is at stake in this election. literally, their lives are on the line if donald trump doesnt win.",108,736264,fake

fox news sundays chris wallace tried to blame hillary clinton for the email scandal that republicans created and got destroyed by clinton campaign manager robbie mook. 
this exchange between fox news sunday host chris wallace and clinton campaign manager robbie mook highlighted why the email scandal isnt working for the gop. 
video 
transcript via fox news sunday wallace the last question i want to ask you is that youre acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was hillary clinton who brought this into the election. 
i want to go back to the e-mail exchange on march 2nd, 2015, when the new york times broke the story about hillary clinton using private e-mails. were going to put it up on the screen. 
clinton adviser neera tanden, why didnt they get the stuff out like 18 months ago? so crazy. 
campaign chairman john podesta, unbelievable. tanden, i guess i know the answer, they wanted to get away with it. 
robby, it was clinton who delayed and it was clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign. 
mook and it is secretary clinton who has said this was a mistake. it is secretary clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation. and it was secretary clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation. and what secretary clinton is doing now is saying, if theres new information, get it out on the table. lets get it out. these could be duplicates. 
again, its been reported these e-mails may not have been sent or received by secretary clinton. we dont know anything. and this close to an election, this unprecedented announcement of new information, when  when, again, its been reported by yahoo! news that  that the fbi may have not even seen it. that  that  that director comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesnt even know what the information is. thats disturbing. and were just asking him, get everything out there that he knows. 
fox news has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of clinton, so they have been reduced to whining about why she didnt release the emails sooner. what wallace left out was that the release of clintons emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure. 
hillary clinton didnt cause this email scandal. house republicans misused their benghazi select committee to go on a fishing expedition for hillary clintons emails. 
robbie mook destroyed fox news with facts, because unlike donald trump, hillary clinton hasnt worked to keep information hidden from the public. trump has not released his tax returns, medical records, or an accounting of his business dealings with russia. trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than 40 years. 
republicans and conservative media are blaming clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election. 
clintons campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing.",133,736267,real
"women everywhere cringe in horror watching donald trump sexually humiliate a woman for revenge by sarah jones on sat, oct 29th, 2016 at 1203 pm donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn. a newly surfaced video via ryan grim shows the trump humiliation game in action, which i walk everyone through from the pov of the woman. share on twitter print this post 
if youre a woman whos worked in any business where youre forced to try to appease the massively sensitive ego of a sexually aggressive, vulgar man in power, you will know exactly whats about to happen in this video. 
donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn. and theres a newly surfaced video via ryan grim at huffington post that shows the trump humiliation game in action. 
in the video, trump publicly sexualizes and shames the 2004 miss universe winner from australia, jennifer hawkins as revenge. before he does it, trump tells the audience, get even with people. if they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. i really believe that. 
watch this newly surfaced 2011 corporate speech here via huffington post major trigger warning if youve been there 
watching this you see the trump modus operandi in action. this is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning trumps advances. the harassment as revenge. the sexual shaming. 
trump sets the audience up for the roman gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should screw people back if they screw you. the sexually angry verb foreshadows whats to come, because he is going to screw jennifer hawkins in public, when she realizes that because its public, she cant further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions. 
trump says hes going to give them an example of his revenge theory, jennifer hawkins. 
trump orders hawkins to the stage. the audience cheers and jeers, delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl. its to be a public spanking. so much fun. 
first of all, how beautiful is jennifer, trump asks, claiming ownership of jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking. the message he can make or break her. she better play nice. 
warning shot, this is about getting even. 
trump tells the audience that he was mad at hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in sydney. he tells the audience how mad he was, and then says, as shes crossing the stage, shes my favorite miss universe. so she thinks maybe this isnt going to be as bad as she fears. 
but then he stabs her publicly for the first time, but i think i like the new one better. 
the audience loves it. he is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnt a good girl. she reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport. 
hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing trump, playing along with his game because she has to, but there will be no easy way out of this one. it wont be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience. she will have to pay. 
i was actually going to get up and tell you that jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but shes not very bright, trump tells the audience, signaling that hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for. 
that wouldnt have been true, but i would have said it anyway, trump proudly tells the audience. this is his alpha male routine, except in real life, the alpha male doesnt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl. but in the mind of little men like trump, this makes him a winner. 
trump points out that hawkins is a big star now, but he helped her make it and then dissed him. he owns her. she must comply or face his wrath. hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him, but trump pushes her away from the microphone. this public shaming will be done from trumps pov only. no need for hawkins to assert her personhood.there will be no defense allowed, because shes already guilty. 
and you know what? she came tonight, she came  came, she came, she came, trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at christmas. he waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming, and they do. they get it. hee heee. so clever. came. knuckles dragging on the floor clever. 
see, so they have the same filthy minds in australia, trump says. 
trump grabs hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her, just like he bragged about doing on the bush tape. 
hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them. the kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek. she is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him, but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact. shes allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him, and pretended to fawn over him as required, but she will not, cannot, allow the kiss. the repulsive kiss. 
im telling this story as i imagine it to be from her point of view, although she has refused to comment. of course she refused to comment, women are told they will be blackballed if they comment. the world is full of men like trump, and they stick together. see roger ailes. women have to play along and appease and if that doesnt work, they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public, especially if they said no in private. 
i can only do this because i have lived it, somewhat like this, in public. and i have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job, while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body. 
from talking to so many women during this election, i know that im not alone. i know that many other women will watch this and know. they will feel the creep of fear and revulsion, the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest. how dare hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce trump. 
and other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it, setting you up to be humiliated even more. they will laugh about it and gossip about it, which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like trump. ironically, if you give in youre not humiliated. its only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object. 
its not just the unwanted kiss, although that is disgusting and assault, much like donald trump bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape. its the public humiliation and denigration. 
its the way the woman is forced, in front of thousands of people, to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge. 
its the way she tries to make it okay, to sweet-smooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire, and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her come and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss. 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people, and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault. its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. 
in fact, this is shades of what trump did to hillary clinton in the stalking debate, after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed.

"why is the foreign policy establishment spoiling for more war? look at their donors - dennis kucinich citizen journalism with a punch why is the foreign policy establishment spoiling for more war? look at their donors 
 war is first and foremost a profitable racket   the nation 
washington, dc, may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo-intellectuality by banding together, declaring themselves think tanks, and raising money from external interests, including foreign governments, to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real-life concerns of the american people. 
as a former member of the house of representatives, i remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular, rococo thinking devoid of depth, reality, and truth. i remember other hearings where the pentagon was unable to reconcile over 1 trillion in accounts, lost track of 12 billion in cash sent to iraq, and rigged a missile-defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target. war is first and foremost a profitable racket. 
how else to explain that in the past 15 years this citys so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in iraq and libya, and interventions in syria and yemen, which have opened pandoras box to a trusting world, to the tune of trillions of dollars, a windfall for military contractors. dcs think tanks should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia. 
according to the front page of this past fridays washington post, the bipartisan foreign-policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than president obama. acting at the urging of liberal hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention, read war, the obama administration attacked libya along with allied powers working through nato. 
the think tankers fell in line with the iraq invasion. not being in the tank, i did my own analysis of the call for war in october of 2002, based on readily accessible information, and easily concluded that there was no justification for war. i distributed it widely in congress and led 125 democrats in voting against the iraq war resolution. there was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for, so, against millions protesting in the united states and worldwide, our government launched into an abyss, with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants. the marching band and chowder society of dc think tanks learned nothing from the iraq and libya experience. 
the only winners were arms dealers, oil companies, and jihadists. immediately after the fall of libya, the black flag of al qaeda was raised over a municipal building in benghazi, gadhafis murder was soon to follow, with secretary clinton quipping with a laugh, we came, we saw, he died. president obama apparently learned from this misadventure, but not the washington policy establishment, which is spoiling for more war. 
the self-identified liberal center for american progress cap is now calling for syria to be bombed, and estimates americas current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on mission accomplished. cap, according to a report in the nation, has received funding from war contractors lockheed martin and boeing, who make the bombers that cap wants to rain hellfire on syria. 
the brookings institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments , notably qatar, a key player in the military campaign to oust assad. retired four-star marine general john allen is now a brookings senior fellow . charles lister is a senior fellow at the middle east institute , which has received funding from saudi arabia , the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend assad and install a sunni caliphate stretching across iraq and syria. foreign-government money is driving our foreign policy. 
as the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder, allen and lister jointly signed an op-ed in the sunday washington post, calling for an attack on syria. the brookings institute, in a report to congress , admitted it received 250,000 from the us central command, centcom, where general allen shared leadership duties with general david petraeus.pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war? this is academic integrity, dc-style. 
and why is central command, as well as the food and drug administration, the us department of transportation, and the us department of health and human services giving money to brookings? 
 former secretary of state madeleine albright, who famously told colin powell , whats the point of having this superb military youre always talking about if we cant use it, predictably says of this current moment , we do think there needs to be more american action. a former bush administration top adviser is also calling for the united states to launch a cruise missile attack on syria. 
the american people are fed up with war, but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation, with russia in syria. 
the demonization of russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a raison dêtre for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of russian world domination. 
its infectious. earlier this year the bbc broadcast a fictional show that contemplated wwiii, beginning with a russian invasion of latvia where 26 percent of the population is ethnic russian and 34 percent of latvians speak russian at home. 
the imaginary wwiii scenario conjures russias targeting london for a nuclear strike. no wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two-thirds of uk citizens approved the new british pms launching a nuclear strike in retaliation. so much for learning the lessons detailed in the chilcot report. 
as this years presidential election comes to a conclusion, the washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept america at war since 911 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place. 
the dc think tanks provide cover for the political establishment, a political safety net, with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention, capitol casuistry. im fed up with the dc policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other peoples lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country. 
any report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tanks sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the reports authors. 
it is our patriotic duty to expose why the dc foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes. 
it is also time for a new peace movement in america, one that includes progressives and libertarians alike, both in and out of congress, to organize on campuses, in cities, and towns across america, to serve as an effective counterbalance to the demuplican war party, its think tanks, and its media cheerleaders. the work begins now, not after the inauguration. we must not accept war as inevitable, and those leaders who would lead us in that direction, whether in congress or the white house, must face visible opposition.",157,736266,fake
"concert plus campaign clinton turns to celebrities in homestretch by reuters   716 pm heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, democratic candidate hillary clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states.   
by roberta rampton 
daytona beach, fla. reuters  heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, democratic candidate hillary clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. 
jennifer lopez will headline a free concert for clinton supporters in miami on saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach  and some visual counter-programming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the white house. 
the federal bureau of investigation said on friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into clintons use of a private email system  a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the nov. 8 vote 
celebrity-driven events like the concert can serve as a bit of a distraction from the controversy, said eric kasper, a political scientist at the university of wisconsin-eau claire. 
it is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive, kasper said. 
the jlo concert is the first in a series. next week, clinton will take the stage with jay z in cleveland, and then with katy perry in philadelphia on nov. 5. 
a harvard university poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, clinton is leading republican rival donald trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show the apprentice. 
but turnout is a concern. the exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the white house has soured young americans on politics, reutersipsos polling shows. 
presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said tevi troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book what jefferson read, ike watched, and obama tweeted 200 years of pop culture in the white house. 
campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture, said troy, a presidential historian who worked in the george w. bush white house. 
the events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a groundswell of support behind a candidate  and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. 
it can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance, kasper said.

"lights, camera, propaganda! washington's anti-russia campaign invades hollywood - danielle ryan lights, camera, propaganda! washington's anti-russia campaign invades hollywood 
keep those russian baddies coming! originally appeared at rt 
for years the influence of the cia in hollywood was hidden and unacknowledged. now its more of an open secret; not publicized, but pretty easy to read up on if you care. just ask the spy agencys entertainment industry liaison. 
yes, such a thing really exists . 
you see, the cias man in hollywood wants to help actors, authors, directors, producers and screenwriters gain a better understanding of the intelligence agency in order to ensure accurate portrayals of its activities. it even wants to help fire up the neurons and actually give you some good ideas if youre coming up short in that department. indeed, the cia provides inspiration for future storylines and lists them on its website. of course, its all in the interest of creating authentic and balanced portrayals of us intelligence agencies and the us military. and theyre quite busy, too. between 2006 and 2011, the cia public relations office had input into at least 22 film and movie projects. 
in a column for the washington post in 2011, david sirota noted that the pentagon too enlists the help of hollywood for pr purposes when things are going awry and americans are becoming weary of war. movies like top gun in the 1980s and zero dark thirty more recently were made in consultation with the pentagon and white house. the result of thiscreative input for pentagon assistance bargain created an entertainment culture rigged to produce relatively few anti-war movies and dozens of blockbusters that glorify the military and which amounts to government subsidized propaganda, 
the cia has had a hand in creating tv shows like 24, homeland andalias. the americans  an fx show about two russian spies living undercover in the us  was created by a former cia agent, and the agency reportedly approves the scripts for each episode. 
a piece in the guardian in 2008 called the cias involvement in hollywood a tale of deception and subversion that would seem improbable if it were put on screen. of course, its unlikely to be put on screen, given that the agency which provides guidance on cia-related movies ... is the cia. 
enlisting hollywood help with anti-russia messaging 
remember the inspiration for future storylines list mentioned earlier? well, guess what? the liaisons current pick for a possible future movie project is about one ryszard kukliński  a polish colonel and spy for nato who spent years passing secret soviet documents to the cia. i wonder why theyd be interested in that sort of thing right now. it couldnt be anything to do with deteriorating relations between russia and the west, could it? 
it may sound like conspiracy theory, but the 2014 hack of sony pictures entertainment revealed that the the us state department has actively sought out the biggest players in hollywood and tried to enlist their help with what they calledanti-russia messaging for the publics consumption through innocent entertainment. in other words, the government asked hollywood for help producing propaganda  although im sure the state department would call it something nicer. 
richard stengel, the us under secretary for public diplomacy, wrote to sony ceo mark lynton explaining that the government needed help countering both isis and russian narratives and said this wasnt something the state department could do on its own. he suggested convening a meeting of media executives to discuss ideas, content, production and commercial possibilities. lynton responded with a list of media executives at other entertainment companies including disney and fox. its unclear from the emails whether that meeting stengel requested ever happened, but judging by much of the recent entertainment industry output, one might be forgiven for assuming it did. 
negative depictions of russia in american and british news and entertainment media are hardly new  but at least as far as i can tell, theres certainly been an uptick over the past 12-18 months, and it coincides nicely with a major us government-led anti-russia messaging campaign which has also spilled over into much of western print and broadcast media. gratuitous mentions of russia and vladimir putin where they are not necessary are becoming tiresome. for me, the last straw was sitting down to watch bridget joness baby last month and being subjected to an entirely unnecessary and irrelevant subplot about the anti-putin punk band pussy riot and their struggle for free speech. it was the last straw because it was just one more in a long line of useless allusions to big bad russia that seemed to come from nowhere. 
for me, the last straw was sitting down to watch bridget joness baby last month and being subjected to an entirely unnecessary and irrelevant subplot about the anti-putin punk band pussy riot and their struggle for free speech. 
in the netflix political drama house of cards, pussy riot  the real ones this time  got their own cameo alongside evil putin not the real one. but even when there isnt a major storyline attached to russia, somehow the country frequently gets thrown in anyway. russia is still the go-to country when there needs to be a joke about scary or immoral foreigners. there are endless examples. 
in nbcs scandal, one character suggests putin might randomly invade belarus. in cbss madam secretary, one character spews the line i cant go back to russia, its a pigsty. in the recently released movie bad moms, one of the bad moms, protesting something or other which i cant recall, shouts what is this, russia? the short-running show allegiancewas entirely about a russian sleeper cell in the us which was suddenly reactivated and whose members  now fully adapted to blissful life in america  no longer wanted anything to do with russia. how original. 
nbcs blacklist has given us multiple russian baddies and the sitcom 2 broke girls has made its fair share of putin jokes. the third installment of the purge introduced us to a gang of menacing russian murder tourists who take advantage of the annual 12-hour period during which any crime, including murder, becomes legal. i could go on, but you get the idea russians are bad. 
is it all cia influence? is it all the result of the state departmentsanti-russia messaging campaign? not necessarily. while the cia does have huge influence in hollywood on specific projects, many of the random negative references to russia are probably the result of a media information war which naturally spills over into the creative output of writers and directors. many of them probably shouldnt be blamed too harshly. theyre fed a diet of anti-russia messaging through the news media, so its no wonder these kinds of lines end up in their movies and tv shows. 
interestingly, in june, the senate intelligence committee included an amendment to congress annual intelligence spending bill which would require the director of national intelligence to submit reports detailing the relationship between the cia and hollywood. but the senate committee is no doubt less worried about the propaganda effects and more worried about the cia divulging sensitive and classified information to movie directors, as was the case, controversially, with zero dark thirty.

"democratic congressman threatens violence if gop tries to defund planned parenthood  daily wire democratic congressman threatens violence if gop tries to defund planned parenthood by hank berrien november 21, 2016 
the democratic congressman who is challenging house minority leader nancy pelosi, ohio rep. tim ryan, threatened a youngstown street fight if donald trump attempts to defund planned parenthood.

russias recent parliamentary elections were, by and large, a dress rehearsal for the more important presidential elections coming up in 2018. between now and then, members of the political establishment will be able to try on new roles, experiment with new campaign slogans, and determine who will play a starring role within the kremlins inner circle. the central consideration is how to consolidate power in a way that balances the interests of the government and the population.
to get an inside look at russias current political landscape, russia direct sat down with andrei kolesnikov of the carnegie moscow center. according to him, the 2016 parliamentary elections provide a preview of what to expect in 2018 and beyond.
russia direct to what extent were the 2016 parliamentary elections fair and legitimate, in your view? andrei kolesnikov in fact, they were juridically legitimate because they were conducted in accordance with russian law. however, the degree of the political, not juridical legitimacy is a debatable question because of the low turnout it means that the representation of russian citizens in the parliament became even less than previously. about one-third of the russian population voted at the elections. ;
even though the united russia ruling party garnered four million fewer votes than during the 2011 elections, it received more seats in the parliament. in addition, liberal politicians are not included in the parliament at all. thus, politically, the legitimacy of the elections is a matter of question.
regarding honesty, these elections were fair in the polling stations with observers, to a large extent. they were honest in the regions, in which the central election commission controlled the electoral process in cooperation with observers. ;
to a lesser extent, these elections were fair and transparent in the distant russian regions or  in the words of prominent political expert dmitry oreshkin  zones of peculiar electoral culture, which saw an abnormally high electoral turnout. i mean, for instance, the republic of tuva in southern siberia, the north caucasus, kemerovo region etc. ;
these regions were controlled by the central election commission to a much lesser extent  no wonder that people were compelled to vote in accordance with the orders of local authorities. the violations in these regions were likely to be common. ;
andrei kolesnikov, ;senior associate and chair of the russian domestic politics and political institutions program at the carnegie moscow center. press photo 
rd does russias central election commission have any tools to influence voting in the distant regions? a.k. there are some instruments, but local authorities limit and restrict them. i dont think the administration of the russian president hampered the work of the central election commission head, ella pamfilova. she tried to balance the interests of russian president vladimir putin and the interests of the countrys civil society. ;
this is the middle-of-the-road position and it is very difficult. she just tried to take into account all positions and signals that were coming from the regions during the electoral campaign and could not ignore them. there were so many of these signals that she objectively and physically could not control the shy;elections throughout the country, especially, in the distant regions.  ;  ;  ;  ;
rd what kinds of violations took place during the 2016 elections, if any? a.k. violations took place, even though they were not large-scale, like previously during the 2011 elections. these violations included the use of administrative resources for influence, rigged and fabricated voting, stuffing the ballot box, and dirty political techniques against the liberal and communist parties during the political campaign and before election day. ;
there was also orchestrated voting, when cadets, students and governmental employees were ordered to vote. this also should be taken into account. all these violations took place not only in distant regions, but also in those under the steady control of the central election commission.
rd why did the united russia party win despite its declining popularity throughout russia? ; a.k. the fact the united russia won the majority in the state duma and the partys popularity are basically different things. its popularity has been decreasing indeed. it is one reality. but it doesnt prevent the party from winning most of the seats. that is the other reality. ;
russian citizens dont see the party as a body that deals with the problems of the population . the credibility and approval rankings of almost all governmental bodies, except law enforcement agencies and the president himself, are dropping. and united russia is not the exception, because people perceive it not as a party, but as a kind of a governmental body. its rating will keep going down, but slowly, step by step.  ;  ;  ; ;
usually, if you vote for united russia, it means a mechanical, symbolic process, a sort of political law-abiding ritual. if you are law-abiding and go to the polling station, you are likely to vote for united russia, because it is necessary. this is the very logic and motivation that drive average voters to elect united russia.  ;
even though some people preferred not to vote for the ruling party, they voted for the current authorities, because there were no real alternatives they voted either for one of the three systemic parliamentary parties or the spoiler parties, which aimed at distracting the attention of voters and preventing the opposition from gaining parliamentary seats.  ;
rd why did the russian opposition fail and what is its key problem? a.k. the reason why they failed can be traced back to the personal ambitions of the opposition leaders. they couldnt team up and compete with each other. in addition, they have different values, in fact. i mean right-leaning liberals and left-leaning liberals dont always agree. this does matter, after all. moreover, these leaders dont have enough political heft. most of them cannot be considered powerful and influential political figures.  ;
another problem is that the authoritarian regime in russia will prevent the emergence of new powerful liberal forces in russia. if such a party emerges and poses a serious challenge to the authorities like opposition leader alexei navalny did, it will be either destroyed or discredited and marginalized. so, in such a situation, it is very difficult to come up with a pragmatic solution. however, this years parliamentary elections proved that the only political democratic force  ;noticeable on a scale of a whole country is the yabloko party and its leader grigory yavlinsky, no matter how you view them. ;
indeed, it is losing popularity year after year, but this party remains firmly within the countrys political landscape and if the opposition is able to persuade voters that yabloko brings together different representatives of liberal and democratic forces as well as well-educated intelligentsia, they might succeed in the future. but in reality its hardly probable. ;
rd you said that the kremlin would prevent the emergence of a new powerful liberal political force in russia, because the existence of such a force contradicts the nature of the authoritarian regime. yet why are the russian authorities afraid of everything that is associated with liberals, if those within the kremlin are pretty confident, if their approval rankings are high among the majority of russians, if people dont trust liberals and the idea of liberalism is totally discredited in the country? a.k. well, first, it is a matter of the logic of development of any authoritative regime. it adds up to total political control. second, in fact, the authorities are not so confident that they are so popular among the people, as implied by the words of russian president vladimir putin, who came to the united russia headquarters after the elections and said that, despite economic challenges and the difficult situation, people voted for united russia. if you read between the lines, you can detect the feeling of the lack of confidence. ;
it means that the social contract  economic well-being in exchange for political freedoms we restrict your political freedoms, but feed you instead  doesnt work anymore and might be not so relevant. thats why the authorities find it necessary to feed people with imperial pride, wars, crimea and increase political control and establish a political monopoly, which also means creating fake liberal parties such as the party of growth. after all, it is a good example of the spoiler artificial party created within the kremlins test tube. and this control is likely to persist as long as this regime exists.  ;
rd what will the 2016 parliamentary elections change in russian politics? a.k. basically, there wont be big changes. tactically, these elections aimed at preparing the groundwork for the 2018 presidential elections and testing russias current political system . and in this regard, this task was fulfilled. by 2018 putin is going to look for new faces and figures to renew his team, but this is going to be a different political process, even though it is partly related to the parliamentary elections. ;
rd you said the 2016 parliamentary elections were a proving ground for the 2018 presidential elections and tested russias current political system. could you be more specific? ; a.k. these elections confirmed the legitimacy of the current russian authorities. once again, the kremlin sees that it does have the mandate to rule the country. putin himself does have this mandate, because the ruling party is associated with his name, and the countrys political unity is based on the crimea narrative and the parliament itself. ;
the system passed the test successfully. so, it can work for a certain period of time as long as everybody is satisfied with this model. thus, the system is ready to live for another 18 months until the 2018 presidential elections, with the parliament organically embedded in this system and ready to fulfill blindly all orders from the president. ;
the other question is how will these elections be conducted in terms of obvious predictability and the absolute absence of interest toward them given the fact that nobody can compete with putin. in fact, he is the only candidate who will win. so, there is the lack of motivation for voters to come to the polling stations in 2018.  ;  ;
rd do you mean that the turnout at the presidential election will be low? ; a.k. the turnout is going to be the key question. in fact, the 2018 election is a referendum that will test the credibility and approval of one person putin. in this situation, the authorities have to create an artificial rivalry to putin, but it is hardly likely to work. the real rival wont be allowed to compete with putin openly, if we are talking about navalny. thus, if putin is once again elected president, there is no motivation to vote. ;
on the other hand, as indicated by this years parliamentary election, those who came to the polling stations observed a sort of political ritual. it is a matter of carrying out a law-abiding commitment. and this might drive people to vote in many russian regions and have an impact on the electoral turnout. however, i expect it to be lower than during the parliamentary elections, especially in moscow and st. petersburg. importantly, the turnout will be low not because people do not trust putin  it will be low because of the absolute predictability of the elections, because of the absence of competition.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ; ;
rd to what extent were this years parliamentary elections different from the ones in 2011  and why didnt they lead to protests ? ; a.k. well, the situations are totally different. in 2011, people were waiting for changes and the continuation of modernization, with urbanites frustrated by the rigged voting and obvious violations during the parliamentary elections. they were also disappointed with the presidential swap, when then president dmitry medvedev decided not to stand for the 2012 presidency and let putin come to power once again, depriving them of the opportunity of a choice. eventually, they took to the streets. ;
yet their protests failed to bring changes among the authorities. moreover, these protests brought about a series of arrests, which had a chilling effect on the protesters. afterwards, the authorities took very repressive legal measures  including the dima yakovlev law that bans foreign families from adopting russian orphans, the laws that restrict the right to organize rallies, laws on foreign agents and undesirable organizations, and other restrictive measures. ;
thus, by the beginning of this years elections, people had been very discouraged. they didnt believe that they could change something. they were not ready to take to the streets. they were totally apathetic and disappointed politically. on top of that, there was the incorporation of crimea. this narrative played its role in bringing people together around the authorities.
also read russia direct's report "" decoding social transformations in russia "" rd remarkably, those who took to the streets in 2011 supported crimeas incorporation. ; a.k. statistically, it is difficult to make any conclusions, yet the correlation does exist. indeed, crimea helped to mobilize people, even part of the liberal-minded citizens. it became the key narrative that mobilized the nation. those who didnt support the incorporation of crimea are seen as outcasts. they are considered to be outsiders. ;
rd how long will the crimea effect be able to unite people around the authorities? ; a.k. it is difficult to say for sure. probably, the abrupt worsening of living standards and drop in income might influence the behavior of the population. yet this is just a hypothesis, because people are still very satisfied with crimeas return to russia they see themselves as being part of a great power. ;
according to the polls of the levada center, people are still supporting the kremlins foreign policy, they dont want the sanctions to be canceled, and they believe they are above these sanctions. they think that russia should keep the counter-sanctions policy instead of trying to persuade the west to lift these sanctions. this mobilization  being in the state of quasi-war  helps them to deal with the economic crisis and adjust to it. honestly, there are no signs of political indignation, which means that people wont orchestrate large-scale political protests.  ;  ;
rd shortly after the parliamentary elections, russian media reported about the kremlins plans to create the ministry of state security or mgb in the russian abbreviation, which is expected to bring together all russian law security agencies. so, it seems to be a reanimated version of the old kgb. what does it mean for russias political future? a.k. russian law enforcement officers play today a significant role in the countrys decision-making process. so, if these plans come true, it means that the authorities are trying to hedge political risks it is a matter of the system defending itself in advance. one of the goals of the mgb is to provide security for the president and this problem will be more relevant by the end of the state dumas tenure, by 2021, because it will be the time when the future of putin will be determined. ;
after 2021, there will be the questions from people and political elites if putin will remain at the helm after 2024 or not, if he will nominate his successor or not, if he will be a lame duck or not. all these questions need to be clarified. and to feel more confident and secure, he needs absolute control. and the creation of such a monstrosity like the mgb is quite logical in such a situation. but this leak about mgb was no more than proving public and elites opinions. presumably, right now this body will not be created.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;
rd there is some speculation that putin might be concerned with a plot prepared by some members of russias political elite. is it really the case? a.k. in fact, today there are not any signs of a conspiracy against putin. the stakeholders within the russian political elites are not interested in it, given a great deal of solidarity and unity around the crimea narrative. even though putin is autocratic in his nature, nevertheless he is very popular among the elites. he builds such a political machine that guarantees him security and prevents any possibility of a coup détat.  ;  ;
rd yet recently putin reshuffled his political deck and asked his chief of staff, sergei ivanov , a former kgb officer, to resign. anton vaino , who was seen by some experts as a political unknown and a neutral technocratic political figure, replaced ivanov. does this resignation mean that putin hedges the risks and just wants to get rid of those who might compete with him? ; a.k. actually, this is the trend, which means the 2018 new team of the president will consist of docile, absolutely loyal bureaucrats, who will be distant from the leader and wont have any claims for power. this is in contrast to putins cronies  governmental oligarchs and his close friends. ;
this team will also comprise the bureaucrats and average men from law enforcement agencies, including security guards and representatives of the special services. this is how putin sees effective governance; this is how he is going to reform the governance system. this is part of his strategy to save his personal security during his next presidential term. these people will have to provide putin with security when he either retires or hands over power to his successor.

""putin is an observer. he is like a weighing-machine that takes into account all views and tries to balance them."" ; photo ria novosti  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ; ;
rd there is also speculation that putin is trying to fuel an artificial rivalry between different law enforcement agencies to strengthen his positions in the kremlin. do you agree? a.k. partly, it is the case. the logic of the mgb is to control this rivalry, watch over it closely and make it more transparent within one big entity. after all, putin is an observer. he is like a weighing-machine that takes into account all views and tries to balance them. he gives them room to compete with each other up to a point and makes certain conclusions. it is a matter of effective political management. ;
look at alexander bastrykin, the chairman of the russian investigative committee. he has been very influential until recently, but he started expressing political claims and got in trouble in july 2016 the federal security service fsb conducted a series of inspections in the investigative committees offices and arrested high-profile officials suspected of corruption and embezzlement  editors note. ;
today, putin doesnt need independent and very corrupt figures. he is ready to put up with the riches of his governmental oligarchs, but as long as they can hide it and fulfill their commitments within their governmental corporations. ;
summing up, putin is creating the environment that can provide him with security and insurance and control the wars with the kremlins inner circle . russias political elites have already received a lot of signals from him if somebody behaves in a wrong way, he will be either dismissed or accused of corruption.
rd how do you see the role of medvedev, given that he has acquired the reputation of a very weak and docile politician? to what extent does he fit into the system? ; a.k. his weakness is his power. his purposefully technocratic nature is his competitive capability. he is convenient, docile. he is between the loyal systemic liberals and law enforcement officials. in addition, his informal agreement with putin is still intact and relevant. politically, it is not in putins interest to replace medvedev with a more powerful and independent politician. ;
in this case putin should choose between liberals and hawks  between former finance minister alexei kudrin and igor sechin the head of russias largest oil company rosneft. yet putin cannot do it right now. he has to choose a middle-of-the-road, technocratic and docile figure like medvedev, who will become a very convenient way to shift responsibility for the economic crisis after 2018. ;
in this regard, the ideal candidate to replace medvedev is anton vaino, putins current chief of staff, or his deputy sergei kiriyenko, who in the eyes of russians was responsible for the 1998 economic default. however, medvedev is a much more experienced politician.
also read "" inside the anti-corruption campaign against russia's liberals "" rd you mentioned the hawks and liberals within the kremlins inner circle. who is more influential today? a.k. you can look at this hierarchy both simplistically and from a more sophisticated point of view. if we tend to simplify, there are the hawks or conservatives and doves or liberals while the former are responsible for politics and foreign policy, the latter deal with the economy, business, the budget and fiscal policy. ;
on the other hand, all these players, especially, law enforcement officials hawks are involved in clan wars to a larger extent than the liberals, who, basically, have nothing to compete for if we dont take into account the debates between the economy ministry, finance ministry and the central banks about the nuances of russias economic policy. ;
the closer we look at the political groups within the kremlin, the more obvious it becomes that all these players are included in putins team in fact, they have less differences than commonalities. after all, all of them support the crimean consensus. they support putins domestic and foreign policy, even though some of them liberals dont approve it. they are just adjusting to the current political situation without openly expressing their disagreement.
rd sooner or later putin will have to step down. to what extent will the transition of power be difficult in russia? a.k. this transition will be very difficult at any rate. after all, there hasnt been a rotation of power for years. the nuance is putin can accelerate the transition to democracy only if it brings benefits to him to save his personal security. if technocrats and liberals are able to persuade him that his security depends on democracy, he might chose this path, yet, again, not because he likes democracy. today he is not ready for liberalization.

"6 miracle drugs big pharma now regrets 6 miracle drugs big pharma now regrets with big pharma, first they promote it, then they discover the risks. by martha rosenberg posted on november 1, 2016 by martha rosenberg 
are you depressed? it may have less to do with your mood than your birth control pills, high blood pressure pills, antibiotics or even anti-hair-loss drug, according to new research. new risks have also emerged with popular gastroesophageal reflux disease medicines and even the top-selling painkiller, tylenol. 
there are two reasons the risks associated with popular drugs seem to trail their aggressive promotion. certainly, as millions use brand name drugs, dangerous side effects and adverse events are seen that did not emerge in much smaller clinical trials. who knew? but also, as intrepid report has noted before, dangerous side effects that might be considered major drawbacks to prescribing the drugs often emerge only when drugs have gone off patent and all their profit potential is realized. for both reasons, drug safety activists recommend waiting five years before taking a new druguntil it is not new anymore. 
here are drugs and drug classes that have raised new concerns. 
1. proton pump inhibitors 
one of pharmas most successful gambits has been its proton pump inhibitors ppis like nexium the purple pill and prilosec that reduce stomach acid. to sell the drugs, pharma aggressively raised awareness of gastroesophageal reflux disease or gerd a rare condition which, over time, can change the lining of the esophagus and lead to cancer. actually, most ppi users have simple heartburn. even babies are now given ppis for baby reflux because they spit up 71 times a daya normal occurrence that has been pathologized. 
are addictive. once a patient has taken a ppi for longer than a few weeks, acid hypersecretion can occur on discontinuation, says a recent article in pharmaceutical journal. this causes rebound symptoms, and frequently establishes a vicious cycle of drug reinitiation and long-term continuation. 
clostridium difficile c diff, bone thinning and fractures and vitamin and mineral deficiencies to chronic kidney disease and heart attacks. now there is a new reported risk dementia. 
jama neurology of 73, 679 people 75 or older with no dementia and taking ppis found the patients had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving ppi. other studies have also found a link. 
fluoroquinolone class which includes cipro and levaquin. even as the fda tries to curtail use of antibiotics on the nations farms to make animals grow faster a use which accounts for most u.s. antibiotic sales drug use on the farm is actually increasing. the fdas 2014 summary report on antimicrobials sold or distributed for use in food producing animals reveals that cephalosporin sales increased by 57 percent between 2009 through 2014, sales of antibiotics like clindamycin increased by 150 percent and sales of antibiotics like gentamicin, a dangerous drug class, increased by 36 percent. 
1974, navy recruits were given antibiotics to see if they would gain weight, and after only seven weeks, they did. similar results were seen in children in guatemala and in babies . but making people fat or encouraging antibiotic resistant microbes like mrsa are the least of the risks, it turns out. 
the bacteria in our gut, the microbiome, which antibiotics compromise as they kill the bad bacteria, are responsible for much more than good digestion. antibiotics also affect the brain and influence our mood and temperament, says food expert michael pollan. if you transplant the gut microbiota of relaxed and adventurous mice into the guts of timid and anxious mice they become less stressed and more adventurous. antibiotic-affected microbiomes may also be behind asthma and autoimmune diseases, acn published reports. 

the doctors case against the pill by barbara seaman was published, wisconsin senator gaylord nelson held hearings about clear links between the pill and depression, blood clots and decrease in libido cited nowhere on the label. no women were asked to speak at the hearings, moving alice wolfson, a co-founder of the national womens health network, to say, it must be admitted that women make superb guinea pigs. they dont cost anything, they feed themselves, they clean their own cages, pay for their own pills, and remunerate the clinical observer. we will no longer tolerate intimidation by white-coated gods antiseptically directing our lives. 
fast-forward to this year, when medical studies again c links between birth control pills and depression, especially in young women, and corresponding higher use of antidepressant drugs. 
the risk of depression has been recognized since women were able to get their hands on oral contraceptives, says cindy pearson of the national womens health network. its been reported by women for 50 years. 
sweetening the pill or how we got hooked on hormonal birth control might also be vindicated, writes lara prendergast. the book was called a dishonest anti-pill treatise because the author dared to point out that hormonal contraceptives are ranked by the world health organization as a class-one carcinogen alongside tobacco and asbestos, she writes. 
about propecia, a popular treatment for male pattern baldness linked to disturbing side effects in men including sexual dysfunction and actual reduction in penis size. at the time, propecias label assured users that sexual side effects went away in men who stopped taking propecia; however, the current label warns about sexual dysfunction like erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility andor poor seminal quality that continues after discontinuation of treatment. 
bmj found the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased for users of finasteride 1mg compared with unexposed men with alopecia hair loss, but reports of the disturbing side effects abound in medical j ournals and popular magazines. 
mens journal last year. 
post-finasteride syndrome foundation . 
 johnson to increase warnings in 2014. unintentional acetaminophen overdoses cause as many as 26,000 hospitalizations and 458 deaths per year reported the fda. 
soon after the increased warnings, medical journals linked acetaminophen to birth defects in the children of women the drug such as poor motor development, behavior problems and language delays. a study in jama pediatrics identified an increased occurrence of adhd by the age of seven in children whose mothers took acetaminophen. a study in the international journal of epidemiology found children more likely to have behavior problems and slow motor development by the age of three if their mothers had taken acetaminophen. not all medical voices concur. some said the studies were poorly designed or that fevers , for which the mother presumably took acetaminophen, are responsible for the birth defects. 
in recent years, acetaminophen has been found to have psychological and mental effects not before described. the pain reliever may blunt individuals reactivity to a range of negative stimuli in addition to physical pain, says study. another study found acetaminophen reduced the psychological pain caused by social rejection. 
6. beta blockers 
one out of americans has high blood pressure and beta-blockers like atenolol tenormin, carvedilol coreg, metoprolol, propranolol inderal, sotalol betapace and timolol timoptic which treat the condition have been linked to depression for many years. 
early as 1967, the british medical journal reported that hypertensive patients treated with propranolol for cardiac arrhythmias experienced a rise in the incidence of depression. still, it has not been known if patients depressions were caused by the actual actions of beta blockers like blocking the effects of epinephrineadrenaline and slowing heart rate or mood conditions associated with the diseases for which beta blockers are prescribed such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. 
hypertension found that beta blockers may have a role in the pathogenesis or course of mood disorders and increased hospital admissions for mood disorders. a bidirectional relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease exists, says the study , because of the overlapping pathophysiological processes that underlie both conditions. 
there is a lot of data that depression and cardiovascular disease are related . . . but current hypertensive practices do not consider depression, said the studys lead author sandosh padmanabhan. there could be some people who are predisposed to depression who we should not be giving these drugs.

"awakened humanity awaits fully scripted ending as controversial election day nears in consciousness , government corruption , society , special interests , us news no event in american history if you ask me has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming november 8, 2016 presidential election. face it. this presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. evil and corruption was brought into the light. weve observed what a george soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. we had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the us overthrew with their democracy tactics using special forces, ngos, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters isis, moderate rebels. this time the engineered chaos was happening here in the us. this 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. we have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from parkinsons disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. this is the stuff hollywood films are made of. the list of the insanity goes on and on, right? weve witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and jerry springer show-like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that americans are not looking into the events in aleppo or mosul much less the hillary-dnc- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the us criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. actually, this understates the situation. what really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs hillary and together their campaign the dnc-hillary-soros-moveon.org-michael moore-hollywood-mainstream media complex has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. actually, im understating the situation again. all or most americans awakened or not are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the us presidential elections. the question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? and to answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. they have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. not sure of this? then please research sandy hook or boston bombing events. or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. thats right. while they were staging one event after another, too many americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. too many americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media stories and narratives unless we could prove that the account didnt happen the way mainstream media said it did. in other words, many americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise, we should believe mainstream media. well here we are in october of 2016 and finally though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. no longer can it be considered a conspiracy by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. that said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 us presidential election. will staged  political terrorism , a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the american psyche, be staged as mike adams at natural news is writing about ? will this terrorism or planned event mark the beginning of the end of america? if so, what will happen? how will it all go down? many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy america? the one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many events of the past several years have been scripted and planned. so today i invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in todays events. the fact that they are planned. the notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. they hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. they need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. do you see a pattern here? one consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness think ruling elite and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free, will allow you to see whats coming this november 8th 2016. whats coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. so the real question is, will their operation succeed? looking at the election day ending from a birds-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan theyll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. in this what ill call wait-and-see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. in other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. this ultimately is all we need to know to plan our truth seekers and freedom lovers next move. and our next move should look something like this if you ask me 1- have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones food, water, shelter and other personal needs 2- expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. lets not let one of these traitors including crisis actors and operatives working for the state get away with what they have done. 3- dont rely only on the internet to keep track of developing events. you might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents proof. also download important videos dont assume these videos will always be available on youtube or the internet. remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. the main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed america and humanity. 4- beware of layered psychological operations. question everything you hear and dont discount that some news is designed for you to hear it get it?. unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war. in deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming russian president vladimir putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the clintons, the mainstream media, the dnc and many others. now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge the occult because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. we truth seekers are all in this together. we didnt ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. perhaps we awakened humanity are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. this species we call humans needs some members of its kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. there is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted. we like them will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. what we need to do more than anything else is . pay attention  think ahead just like they do. and so today im thinking ahead. i have plans for both scenarios trump or hillary declared victory. i have plans for no political terrorism and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. in my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the us constitution. this is more important than any presidential election. will a trump victory make this accountability more possible? many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. finally, im reminded of the very last line of the film  the american dream  when the villain asks what do you think this is? and the answer this is america!!. likewise, lets remember, this is america, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the us constitution. will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? that question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. this is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day. submit your review",195,736264,fake

dailycaller  tens of thousands of pages detailing the case for impeachment against former president bill clinton have remained locked away from the public for almost 20 years. 
although many believe that the report issued by then independent counsel ken starr revealed the final findings of his investigation of clinton in the late 1990s, around 60,000 pages of documents seen by only a few people describe the house judiciary committees case against the 42nd president.

"israeli troops demolish three palestinian homes in al-quds palestine palestinians inspect the damaged house of zaid amer, after it was demolished by the israeli army, in the west bank city of nablus, may 3, 2016. photo by ap 
israeli troops have razed to the ground at least three houses in the east jerusalem al-quds, in the latest demolition of palestinian property in the occupied territories. 
local media reported that israeli forces demolished the buildings in the neighborhoods of beit hanina and silwan on wednesday without prior notice, displacing at least 44 palestinians including children. 
the united nations has documented a dramatic rise in demolitions, saying 124 palestinians, including 60 children, were left homeless in the occupied west bank in a single day in april. 
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha also said in august that a total of 726 palestinian structures had been razed in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem al-quds since january, and that the demolitions had affected 1,020 palestinians. 
the world body noted that there were 533 demolitions and 688 displaced palestinians in the entire 2015, meaning that demolitions so far this year have increased more than 36 percent. this picture taken on march 14, 2011 shows a general view of a construction site in the west bank settlement of modiin illit. photo by ap 
the demolitions have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over tel aviv's sustained violation of international law. the demolished structures include houses and schools. 
the israeli razing of palestinian homes along with its illegal settlement expansion in the occupied palestinian territories have dimmed hopes of any peace in the region. 
over half a million israelis live in more than 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 israeli occupation of the west bank, including east al-quds. the settlements are considered by the international community as illegal. 
the occupied territories have witnessed increased tensions ever since israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of palestinian worshipers into the al-aqsa mosque compound in east jerusalem al-quds in august 2015. 
nearly 250 palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of israeli forces since the beginning of last october. loading ...",139,736264,fake

"breaking florida election employees caught faking 1,000s of stolen absentee ballots in massive voter fraud scheme - usapoliticsnow usapoliticsnow admin 2016 election , us news 
broward county is one of the largest swing counties in florida. it would not take much voter fraud there to flip it. 
the voter fraud whistle-blower is a former secretary of elections department employee and she has filled out a sworn affidavit 
you can read the affidavit here. the affidavit by chelsey marie smith accuses broward county officials of filling out blank absentee ballots to officials who she saw filling the ballots out at the supervisor of elections headquarters. smith said she was asked to deliver numerous ballots to a secret locked room where employees were filling out the absentee ballots. at first she was not clear as to what was happening. when she finally clearly saw what was up and reported it, she was terminated and told to never come back! 
after being caught red-handed engaging in voter fraud, broward country fl sec of elections brenda snipes claimed staff were replicating damaged ballots in the locked secret room without official monitors present. yeah, that was a good one brenda! 
according to the whistle-blower, the massive voter fraud went on day after day and included what had to be thousands of ballots. brenda snipes is already under lawsuit for deliberately misprinting absentee ballots! why is she still around?

recently, numerous florida voters have complained that they have not been receiving their absentee ballots. it seems we have found where some are going! how many other counties have a secret locked room!! 
democrats live by an ends justify the means mentality. cheating and stealing is of no issue to them as long as the outcome is the one that they want! voter fraud is entirely legitimate to them. 
update 
fox news reported that the florida gop has also filed a voter fraud lawsuit for illegally opening absentee ballots! 
the state gop alleges that officials in broward county, which includes fort lauderdale, have been opening tens of thousands of vote-by-mail ballots prior to them being cleared for counting. 
chairman blaise ingoglia told shapiro that florida law prescribes that when the supervisor of elections takes in all these ballots, they have to be approved by the canvassing board. 
therefore, the officials have no legal authority to open the ballot envelopes. 
ingoglia said none of the ballots had been approved, so the party will be filing a lawsuit at 9 a.m. et thursday if county officials do not respond to his complaint by close-of-business on wednesday.

before the recent torrent of daily podesta email dumps brought renewed attention to wikileaks and accusations julian assange was working with the kremlin despite his recent denial, which ultimately cost him his internet access, the medias attention was closely focused on the recently emerged hacker known as guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be behind the hacking of the nearly 20,000 democratic national committee emails and other documents distributed over the summer by wikileaks, and who likewise was accused of cooperating with russia. 
earlier today, after a two week silence, guccifer 2.0 reemerged, with a post on his blog , in which he alleges that he has information from inside the federal election commission, according to which democrats may rig the elections. he then adds this may be possible because of the software installed in the fec networks by the large it companies. info from inside the fec the democrats may rig the elections id like to warn you that the democrats may rig the elections on november 8. this may be possible because of the software installed in the fec networks by the large it companies. as ive already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. i have registered in the fec electronic system as an independent election observer; so i will monitor that the elections are held honestly. i also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the u.s. society about the facts of electoral fraud. 
it is unclear what fec information the hacker was in possession of, or was referring to, and how he intends to observe the elections. a recent video by bev harris of blackboxvoting provided a real-time demo of the gems vote-fraud system, fraction magic, an election theft mechanism with context and explanation. there is much more detail on the blackboxvoting website . 
the demonstration below used a real voting system and real vote databases and takes place in seconds across multiple jurisdictions. over 5000 subcontractors and middlemen have the access to perform this for any or all clients. it can give contract signing authority to whoever the user chooses. all political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors. its a product. its scaleable. it learns its environment and can adjust to any political environment, any demographic. it runs silently, invisibly, and can produce plausible results that really pass for the real thing. 
it is possible that this is the process that guccifer is referring to, although we are merely speculating. we are confident he will provide more detail shortly.

"jesus christs burial slab uncovered during restoration posted by eddie a burial slab believed to have held the body of jesus christ before he was resurrected has been uncovered for the first time in centuries by a restoration team in jerusalem. the original limestone shelf, known as a burial bed, was exposed during the restoration of the church of the holy sepulchre after being covered by marble since at least 1555 a.d. it will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of christ was laid, fredrik hiebert, an archaeologist involved in the discovery, told national geographic . according to scripture, jesus christ was laid on the shelf in the tomb after dying at the crucifixion around 33 a.d. after three days his remains were discovered to be missing and jesus was said to have appeared over a span of 40 days before ascending into heaven. the discovery was made by a team of scientists from the national technical university of athens ntu who were making restorations to the edicule  little house , a structure which had been built around the tomb. researchers now hope to study the original surface to better understand the original tomb and how it evolved to become one of the most sacred sites in christendom. we are at the critical moment for rehabilitating the edicule, chief scientific supervisor professor antonia moropoulou told national geographic. the techniques were using to document this unique monument will enable the world to study our findings as if they themselves were in the tomb of christ. the newly-uncovered surface was described as having a grey-beige stone surface. also known as the church of the resurrection, its custody is shared between six christian sects including the greek orthodox church, the roman catholic church and the armenian orthodox church, whom together invited the ntu to undertake the restoration. at a cost of us4 million, 3.7 million the restoration was not cheap, with major donors including jordans king abdullah ii and mica ertegun, widow of atlantic records co-founder ahmet ertegun. from around the web founder of worldtruth.tv and womansvibe.com eddie  8899 posts

"donald trump is the 45th president of the united states  guardian liberty voice after a long night and a hard election, donald j. trump was elected as the 45th president of the united states. in the early hours of november 9, 2016, hillary clinton conceded the election.
both candidates helped usher in a new political era; she is the first woman to get this far in a presidential election successfully. whereas, trump is the first person to be elected to the highest office in the u.s. who never served in the military and never served in a political capacity.
when the night culminated with trump winning well over the required 270 electoral votes, the election was called. the reality star now holds a new title, president elect donald j. trump.
his presidency will begin with republicans holding the majority in both chambers of congress. president-elect trump will be nominating a new supreme court justice to fill the seat vacated when antonin scalia died in february.
surprising night at the polls on november 8, the polls began to close at 600 p.m. et on the east coast. whereas on the west coast, the polls closed 1100 p.m. there were early projections, which made hearts race. the numbers bounced back and forth in many key swing states. that is until eastern states tallies began to roll in, then the numbers evened out.
polling site glitches many polling sites experienced technical issues. trump attempted early in the day to sue nevada because the polls in clark county remained open for an hour and a half on nov. 7. the judge stated there was no fraud since the states law indicates if a person is in line before the polling site closes, they must be allowed to cast their ballot.
in durham county, n.c., there was a delay beginning the votes, so the democratic party sought to have the time extended to make up for time lost. this was granted, and the polls remained open for 30 of the 45 minutes requested.
donald trump needs to reunite the country commentators on cnn politics agree that the campaign tore through the fabric that makes america great. during the campaigning, citizens became polarized into two drastically divisive and hateful camps.
how is president elect trump going to heal the wounds he inflicted on clintons supporters, the muslim community, latino citizens, and every other group?
during trumps campaign, he threatened to have clinton arrested when he won, build a wall between the u.s. and mexico, close the mosques, and restart stop and search policies. he said he would repeal the affordable care act, and lower the tax ceiling for the richest americans.
his supporters are thrilled, and clintons voters are stunned. there are fear and confusion in the air.
hillary clinton concedes clinton sent out her campaign manager to tell her supporters that it was late and the final tallies were not going to happen soon. she asked them to go home and get some rest. the announcement was made that clinton would speak in the morning.
within an hour, trump told his supporters that she had called him and conceded. the president-elect proffered a simple acceptance. he stated that his was not a campaign but a movement for change.

"'they live'  possibly the most powerful message in a movie . 'they live'  possibly the most powerful message in a movie they live is a science-fiction movie from the eighties that features aliens, a wwf wrestler and a ... print email  they live is a science-fiction movie from the eighties that features aliens, a wwf wrestler and a whole lot of sunglasses. whats not to like? while, at first glance, the movie appears to be a bunch of nonsense, they live actually communicates a powerful message about the elite and its use of mass media to control the masses. is the movie describing the control of the illuminati over our society? this article looks at the deeper meaning of john carpenters strange but fascinating movie  they live . warning major spoilers ahead get over it, the movie is 24 years old. watching they live is a conflicting experience. it is an odd combination of eye-opening messages with lackluster acting, powerful social commentary with 1950s b-movie special effects and gripping satire with odd punchlines. constantly making viewers oscillate between wow, that was genius! to wow, that was corny!, it is difficult to properly evaluate the movie from a cinematographic point of view. however, from a message point of the view, they live is gold. based on ray nelsons short story eight oclock in the morning, the movie is one of those rare subversive stories that forces viewers to question their world and their surroundings. because, despite the fact that the movie is about ghoulish aliens, it communicates truths to the viewers that are only alluded to in mainstream movies. in fact, looking deeper into the storyline, one might realize that theres probably more science than fiction in the story of they live  especially when one has truth-seeing sunglasses.the hero of the movie, played by wwf wrestler rowdy roddy pipper, is a drifter that is apparently nameless. in the short story and the movies credits, he is referred to as nada, which means nothing in spanish. while this nameless nothing is broke and homeless, he still manages to expose the aliens hidden rule of the world. how did he accomplish that? with the only thing hed ever need the truth. oh, and also guns. he used a lot of guns. most importantly, despite the fact that nada was tempted several times to shut up in exchange for generous compensation, he kept his integrity and never agreed to sell out to the aliens. now, thats a role model. to top it off, he says the best things ever. im here to kick ass and chew bubble gum  and im all out of bubble gum. are the aliens in the movie an imaginative way to portray the worlds elite , those who secretly run the world, those we call the illuminati? lets revisit this cult classic and see how it describes the hidden rule of the elite. the premise right from the beginning, as we see nada walking around los angeles with his backpack, the movie sets a particular mood something is not quite right. while nada appears to be a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, the city is not happy and it is not too kind to happy-go-lucky kind of guys.quite the contrary, there is a sense of impending doom in the air poverty is rampant, helicopters fly around the city and street preachers speak of soulless beings ruling the world. the venom of snakes is under their lips. their mouths are full of bitterness and curses. and in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery. and the fear of god is not before their eyes! they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders. they have recruited the rich and powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth! and our human spirit is corrupted. why do we worship greed? because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death are our owners. our owners  they have us. they control us. they are our masters. wake up. theyre all about you, all around you!. is the preachers description of the masters applicable to the illuminati? i believe so.as we follow nadas aimless drifting across the city, the camera often focuses on people gazing blankly at television screens, mindlessly absorbing the vapid messages it communicates. regular joes appear to truly enjoy their television shows  until an obscure organization hacks the airwaves to broadcast subversive messages about the hidden rulers of the world. our impulses are being redirected. we are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.  the poor and the underclass are growing. racial justice and human rights are nonexistent. they have created a repressive society, and we are their unwitting accomplices. their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness. we have been lulled into a trance. they have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others. we are focused only on our own gain. please understand. they are safe as long as they are not discovered. that is their primary method of survival. keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated. can the above statement be applied to those in power? i believe so.the average joes who watch this pirated tv broadcast all get a massive headache  the raw truth is indeed too much for most people to bear. one such viewer switches the channel after telling the guy on tv blow it out your ass. just like today, most people do not want to hear about this kind of stuff  they just want to go back to their mindless tv viewing.nada realizes that the street preacher and the man on television are connected through a local church. when he sneaks into the church, he discovers that it is actually the headquarters of an underground organization.on a wall inside the church is written they live we sleep, a phrase that describes the fundamental difference between the elite and the masses. those in power know the truth about the world and possess the means and the power to truly live.the rest of the population is sedated, dumbed-down and manipulated into a zombie-like status in order for it to be as easily manageable as possible by the masters. the masses ignorance equals a state of endless slumber.nada learns that the rebellious organization is attempting to recruit people to take down the rulers. however, a few days later, nada discovers what happens to those who plot against those in power.helicopters, bulldozers and police in riot gear raid the place, destroy everything and violently arrest the members of the underground organization. that is how the elite responds to contrary views.after witnessing the violent police shakedown , nada begins to realize that something is wrong in america. the happy-go-lucky guy who believed in working hard and following the rules is starting to believe that something is amiss here.determined to learn more, nada re-enters the church and finds a few interesting things.the police painted over they live we sleep. obviously, they dont want that message to be known .more importantly, nada discovers a box full of sunglasses that allows his to see the world as it is. added bonus they also look pretty cool. seeing the truth while the sunglasses found by nada appear on the surface to be worthless, they actually provide him with the greatest gift of all the truth. when nada first puts on the sunglasses, the experience is shocking.when he has his sunglasses on, nada sees through the smoke and mirrors projected by advertisement and mass media . he only sees the core of their message and the only reason why they exist.no matter which magazine nada flips open, he sees the same subliminal messages, which tells a lot about the true function of celebrity and fashion magazines.despite the fact that they are all different, they all ultimately serve the same purpose to reinforce messages from the elite to the masses. nada also quickly understands the truth about money . in god we trust? some people are not human . they are from another race that has infiltrated society. nada realizes that they are everywhere and that they hold positions of power, like this politician giving a typical politician speech on television. is this a way to portray the illuminati, or something much-much deeper ?upon discovering this truth, nada became pissed off. really pissed off. how did he react to the situation? he did not go home and write a poem about it. nope, he grabbed a shotgun and started shooting aliens.when the aliens realize that nada can see through their disguise, they immediately alert the authorities saying ive got one that can see. being able to see is obviously frowned upon by the aliens  they do not like to be exposed. nada quickly becomes a social pariah and aliens start closing in on him. confronted with this situation, nada says profound and timeless words i dont like this ne bit.many aliens are part of the police force as its sole purpose is to ensure that the aliens rule is not disturbed. most policemen are however regular humans and just follow the orders because thats their job  a little like actual policemen who do the illuminatis work.nada and everyone in the city are constantly monitored by flying surveillance cameras that are oddly similar to the new unmanned drones that are currently appearing around the world.flying surveillance cameras were considered science fiction in 1988. they are reality today.an actual, modern unmanned drone mounted with a video camera.the concept of truth-seeing sunglasses is an interesting way to illustrate the importance of knowledge in ones world perception. two people can be looking at the exact same thing yet perceive two very different realities, depending on the level of information and awareness possessed by each person. nadas sunglasses can therefore represent ones knowledge of the truth, which allows a clear perception of reality. looking for others who know the truth upon learning the shocking truth about the world, nada feels the need to share this vital information with his friend frank armitage. nada however quickly realizes some people do not want to hear about it. in fact, many actually get angry and offended at the simple mention of something that alludes to it. when nada asks frank to put on his sunglasses so he can see what he sees, frank firmly refuses and calls him a crazy motha.nada replies with another classic line either you put these sunglasses on or start eating that trash can.then ensues one of the longest one-on-one fight scene i ever seen eight minutes of punching and kicking, a scene that is dragged out for so long that it becomes utterly absurd and even comical. while the scene maybe appear ridiculous, it says something about the difficulty of making regular, average people wake up from their blissful ignorance.frank finally sees the truth. all it took is nada beating the crap out of him, sticking the sunglasses on his face against his will and forcing him to look around. yes, convincing other people of the truth can be a hard task.it takes a lot of effort on nadas part, but frank finally sees the aliens controlling the world. the two pals are then invited to a secret meeting of the underground organization that is attempting to rid the earth from the aliens.during the meeting, nada and frank are given truth-seeing contact lenses. the sunglasses gave truth-seers a nasty headache, especially when they are taken off. when first exposed to the truth, adapting to the new reality can indeed be difficult, and even painful. however, after a while, it becomes seamless part of the person. a little like wearing contact lenses.during the meeting, nada and frank learn that humans are being recruited by the aliens in exchange for wealth and power. as the leader of the underground organization says most of us just sell out right away. it is rather easy to make a correlation between the movie and actual politicians and celebrities weve seen in previous articles on this site who readily sell out to the illuminati in exchange for wealth, power and celebrity.the meeting doesnt last long, however, as police barge in the place and start shooting everyone there. they are designated a terrorist organization by the elite. nada and frank manage to escape and accidentally find themselves behind enemy lines, in the aliens underground base. behind enemy lines while exploring the aliens underground base, nada and frank stumble upon a party thrown by the aliens for human collaborators to thank them for their partnership. although humans will never be considered equals to the aliens, those who sell out to them get monetary benefits  much like those who are not part of todays elite who nevertheless sell out to push the elites new world order agenda . our projections show that by the year 2025, not only america but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance. the gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite. frank and nada then discover the source of the aliens brainwashing signals a television studio. the aliens use the network to broadcast hypnotic and subliminal signals to humans, blinding them from the truth about their rulers and the world. the message that is communicated here mass media is the elites favorite tool indoctrinate the masses and to keep them in servitude. the tv station cable 54 is used by the aliens to hypnotize humans. is this science-fiction? barely. nada realizes that the only way to save humanity from the grips of the aliens is to go to the roof of the tv stations building and to take down the emitter of the subliminal messages, disguised as a satellite dish. indeed, without an elite-controlled mass media, indoctrinating the masses will be a lot more difficult. so nada and frank start shooting their way towards the roof, not an easy task. the disinformation agent while this lady appeared to be nice at first, she tried to mislead, deceive and even kill nada during his quest. she ends up shooting his pal frank in the head.nada met holly thomspon, a cable 54 network executive, at the beginning of his wild rampage. while nada appears to be somewhat enamoured with her, she always somehow brings trouble. during the terrorist organization meeting, holly infiltrated the group, posing as a sympathizer and claiming that cable 54 was clean and was not the source of aliens signal, which was false and misleading. today, disinformation is widely used by the elite to confuse and mislead those who attempt to discover the truth about the world.during nadas rush towards the roof of the networks building, holly appears again, claiming that she wants to help him. however, she is simply trying to kill him before the mission is accomplished. she is therefore another human that sold out to the aliens being used to disrupt non-corrupted humans attempting to liberate themselves and others. taking down the aliens heres the biggest spoiler of them all nada manages to take down the aliens transmitter and saves humanity. this heroic move gets him killed, however, as a policeman inside a helicopter shoots him dead. nada therefore becomes the quintessential hero, sacrificing his life for the good of humanity  a martyr for human freedom from soulless rulers .even though it cost his life, nada visibly does not regret exposing the aliens to the world. with his last once of strength, nada gives the aliens a uniquely human parting gift the finger.tv viewers around the world now realize that those giving the daily news were also those who controlled them. in conclusion although they live is usually described as a science-fiction movie that criticizes consumer culture, the scope of its message actually goes way beyond the usual consumerism is bad lecture. they live can indeed be interpreted as a treatise on the thorough and systematic conditioning of human experience in order for a hidden elite to covertly control, manipulate and exploit the masses. in the movie, the rulers are portrayed as a completely different race that perceives humans as inferior  something that can easily be correlated to the attitudes about the bloodlines of the illuminati. the presence of these strong messages in the movie is one of the reasons they live became somewhat of a cult-classic, despite the fact that it was panned by movie critics. as the years go by, the movies message is becoming increasingly relevant  and freakishly realistic.many of those who seek the truth about the world realize that its reins are held by an un-elected elite, one that is essentially hidden from the public eye. as the movies promotional poster says you see them on the street. you watch them on tv. you might even vote for one this fall. you think theyre people just like you. youre wrong. dead wrong. working behind the scenes, this secretive elite constantly works towards the creation of a global system that would serve its interests a new world order , ruled by one world government. as a human collaborator says in the movie to justify his selling-out there aint no countries anymore. no more good guys. theyre running the whole show. they own everything. the whole goddamn planet! to facilitate the rulers work, the masses are kept in the dark and are distracted with the fake puppet show that is politics and the no independent thought programming that is mass media . apathy, ignorance and indifference are the elites best friends.despite its unimpressive special effects and odd dialogue, they live manages to describe the world elites motives and strategy in a way that can be understood by all. and that is no simple task. however, in order to fully understand the movies message, one must be wearing truth-seeing sunglasses. do you have yours on? reference   they live is available on amazon. dear friends, humansarefree is and will always be free to access and use. if you appreciate my

""because of the sniper fire from the militants, another attempt of the syrian authorities and the russian reconciliation center to evacuate around 40 people from eastern districts of aleppo to safe regions of the city was derailed,"" russian defense ministry spokesman maj. gen. igor konashenkov said on thursday, adding that the incident happened overnight . the general also said that russian and syrian planes have stayed at least 10 kilometers 6.2 miles away from aleppo for nine days, after the sorties were halted on october 18. two days after the strikes ceased, damascus and moscow organized safe passage corridors for those wishing to leave the besieged neighborhoods. six safe routes are now being offered to civilians, while two have been designated for armed rebels. the jihadists, however, refuse to surrender and constantly shell escape routes and government-controlled parts of the city.

"wikileaks email proves democrats manipulate polls email 

an email published by wikileaks on friday reveals the extent to which democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. 
the 2008 email appears shows democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. 
fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. sample too small otherwise, operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala, campaign chairman john podesta, media matters for america founder david brock, and operative susan mccue. good, begala responded. 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. there is ample evidence that this occurs in democrat-friendly newsrooms. 
hillary clinton has opened up a 7-point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week, the daily mail reported in june. 
""but the weekly tracking poll, from nbc news and the surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more self-identified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the poll's topline result,"" the article noted. 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics.

""i think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout,"" rand paul said in an interview on wednesday on ""the tom roten show"" out of west virginia.

"idaho mom loses two children for using medical cannabis to stop seizures idaho mom loses two children for using medical cannabis to stop seizures image courtesy of kutv.com 
by paul fassa health impact news 
an idaho mother has lost custody of her two children due to her states strict laws regarding marijuana, where it is not legal even for medical purposes for physicians to prescribe. 
kelsey osborne, 23, has lost custody of her two young children, son ryker and daughter madyson aged two and three respectively, to state child protective services cps. both children were removed even though only madyson was allegedly treated with cannabis during a horrific seizure episode. kelsey now faces the charge of causing injury to a child. 
idaho is a bastion of resistance to medical marijuana bordered by three very liberal cannabis states, washington, oregon, colorado, and one medical marijuana state that is improving its access to patients, montana. not long ago, a state congressional panel in idaho rejected a proposal to allow cbd non-psycho active cannabidiol for children with seizures. 
this allowance has been granted in several states that still oppose medical marijuana generally. theyre comfortable with allowing it due to the absence of thc chemical that makes people high with cbd oils and the fact that more and more children are severely epileptic than before, and many pharmaceutical medications are not working but worsening their conditions. 
instead, idaho governor c.l. butch otter opened up pharmaceutical research for synthetic cbd to be tested among 25 children. problem is, synthetic pharmaceuticals of any herb or plant cannot exactly duplicate the active ingredient and do not contain the entourage effect of the many balancing compounds the marijuana plant offers. 
cbd and thc are the two major cannabinoids among 60 others in the whole plant. cbd extracted from whole plant hybrid cannabis grown to minimize thc, has demonstrated strong efficacy and safety for epileptic seizures among young children. 
this was the dilemma kelsey dealt with to pull her daughter madyson from her intense agony and seizures during her withdrawal from risperdal, an anti-psychotic drug madyson was prescribed after her adverse reaction with the mmr vaccine. 
madyson was prescribed such a strong and dangerous anti-psychotic pharmaceutical because her doctor couldnt determine the cause of her aggressive behavior and angry outbursts, a manifestation of one aspect of the autism disorder spectrum. obviously, he wouldnt confirm that the mmr vaccine caused her spells of aggressive anger. most pediatricians wont dare go there. 
during madysons time with kelseys ex-husband, he took madyson off risperdal cold turkey. thats a no-no, considered by many as even more dangerous than taking the drug. 
the next day, madyson was screaming in pain, vomiting with intense seizures, hallucinating, and begging for help. evidently, kelsey was up somewhat on medical cannabis research. if cbd would have been an option, she would have allegedly used that instead. 
but thats not an option in idaho. so kelsey somehow got marijuana with thc then infused it into butter, which she spooned into a smoothie. within a half-hour, madyson was relieved of her agonizing symptoms. 
kelsey had made an appointment with madysons pediatrician and brought her there soon after using the marijuana infused butter to calm her down. the pediatrician took a blood sample. thats when the thc showed up, compelling the pediatrician to call cps and report the discovery of thc in a three year old child. 
this is what led to kelsey losing all custody of her children and being charged with causing injury to a child. her case is scheduled to be heard on december 22, 2016. a case for the legalization of medical marijuana 
a group called moms for marijuana international has picked up the cause of allowing medical marijuana for children by backing up kelsey in her fight to regain custody of her children and getting acquitted of the prosecutions charge of causing injury to a child. her trial has been extended for december. 
the cps case is based solely on the fact that cannabis is completely illegal in idaho. kelseys attorney r. thomas curl argues 
the state is relying on injury to a child because its illegal. it cannabis is illegal in idaho but they cannot demonstrate injury to this child. and if they cannot demonstrate injury to this child they are missing one of the elements of the crime. and if they are missing one of the elements, then they have no case. 
the fact is that risperdal, especially with the sudden withdrawal conducted by the father, is what caused considerable harm, or actual injury to madyson. also, that prescription was given out of refusing to acknowledge the harm allegedly caused by another legal pharmaceutical, the mmr vaccine. 
the reality is that kelseys intervention with cannabis seemed to have rescued her daughter from a hellish nightmare of agonizing seizures, pain, and constant vomiting. 
interestingly, another group similar to moms for marijuana calls itself mothers advocating medical marijuana for autism mamma . their primary mission is for medical marijuana states, which are currently increasing in number, to consider cannabis, even with thc, as a legal alternative for children diagnosed with autism. 
only one state, delaware has that provision in its medical cannabis bylaws. anecdotal reports have demonstrated that children with resistant cases of autism, especially aggressive behavior, are not always handled with cbd oils or tinctures. 
often it takes the full spectrum of cannabis oil with thc. until autism is included as a valid reason for using cannabis, families have to resort to using one or more physiological manifestations of autism that fit within any states allowances for their autistic children to benefit. 
kelsey osbornes case may prove to be instrumental in furthering the cause of permitting autism to be included in several medical marijuana states, which have expanded significantly in the recent november 8th, 2016 election.

"trump erupts at secret meeting with the press, transition in chaos tweets  addicting info  the knowledge you crave on november 21, 2016 758 pm  
donald trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and hes only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the president-elect. 
on monday, trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. this meeting was particularly important because trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. 
some reporters in attendance were nbcs deborah turness, lester holt and chuck todd; abcs james goldston, george stephanopoulos, david muir and martha raddatz; cbs norah odonnell and charlie rose; fox news bill shine, jack abernethy, jay wallace, suzanne scott; msnbcs phil griffin; and cnns jeff zucker and erin burnett. it was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. 
unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. or, as one person put it , it was like a fcking firing squad. 
trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. according to the new york post , one anonymous source said 
the meeting was a total disaster. the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration, but instead they got a trump-style dressing down. 
this claim was backed up by another person, who said 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
trump kept saying, were in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar, and cnn was network of liars. 
this attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, trump barely let them speak. while this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of trump. he has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. 
americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is twitter twitter twitter 
interestingly enough, trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. she said 
excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.

"the catholic church uses tax-exempt funds to stop marijuana legalization by rmuse   1003 am ""the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. if passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries""   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
for almost all secular humanists, organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation. throughout recorded history, the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents, but any humans it comes in contact with. that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the 21st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women. apparently, the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population. 
on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a last-ditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use. other reports reveal that the tax-exempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure, question 4 . question 4 simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over 21 and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts. question 4 contains no references to the catholic, or any other church, and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries . 
a spokesman for the boston archdiocese, terrence donilon, made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying  
 it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. its a recognition that, if passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries . 
seriously, that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use tax-free congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered. nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned, much less affected by the outcome of an election. catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis. and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes, the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes, and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women. no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry, but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession, free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests, and relieve americas over-burdened judicial system. 
now, the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally, whether they inhale or eat it, will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries . that is an odd assertion on yet another point; surely part of catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible. it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet, including those in massachusetts, are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter 2, verse 9 the catholics  almighty god  said 
 out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food.  and he continues in verses 15-17 ,  then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it. the lord god commanded the man, saying, from any tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die . 
although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities 10,000 years ago , there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;  weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past two-thousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal. 
in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with tax-exempt money, an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question 4, jim borghesani, said  
 the archdiocese has come up with a position that, frankly, we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science. what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color, to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested . 
one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans, mainly americans of color, sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat . obviously, that is the case and according to a new set of data, keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every 25 seconds of every day of the year. 
why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed war on drugs in general, and the criminalization of marijuana in particular? as noted by michael stone over at patheos, what the massachusetts catholics, and mormons, are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color . mr. stone really nails it when he said that by spending tax-exempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana; the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow . 
the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy, besides implicit racism. because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using tax-exempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible . mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry, but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites; at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned. 
the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an anti-marijuana super pac , but they are using tax-exempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives; the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society. however, if the church is so flush with money; why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests? or, dog forbid, use that tax-exempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need. 
the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents, and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right, what is wrong, and how to stay out of the proverbial hell; that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity. but for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated tax-exempt money to impact read control their private lives. the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question 4 will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hard-earned money. 
this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen, except donald trump. it is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with tax-exempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans, many of whom use recreational cannabis.

the increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites, gallup reported in analyzing its results.
the sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive  both politically and for their lives while they are on duty  amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings, it added.
gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.
its unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer, it wrote.

"trump has gotten the republican party sued for trying to intimidate voters the washington post reported  
the democratic national committee has filed papers in federal court against the republican national committee, accusing it of violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation. 
the motion filed in new jersey says the rnc has supported the efforts of presidential candidate donald trumps campaign to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 presidential election. trump has recently been urging his supporters to monitor polling places on election day. 
democrats arent going to stand by and let trump supporters waltz into polling places in heavily democratic areas to intimidate voters. 
trumps call for his supporters to go to polling places that arent their own to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree. 
the republican party, which has completely abandoned the idea of winning elections based on ideas, is firmly standing behind their nominee because the same party that was too weak to stop trump during the primary is certainly not going to stand in the way of what might be their only chance of winning. 
people should not be afraid to go to the polls and vote. no matter who you are voting for, democrats have your back. the republican party has been trying to suppress the vote and intimidate voters for years. 
democrats are on to their tricks, and as the lawsuit demonstrates, trump and the gop are not going to get away with intimidating voters.",133,736264,real

"what was the halloween death smog disaster? and other scary questions and answers about fluoridation license dmca 
1. why do some people object to water fluoridation? doesn't fluoride occur in the water naturally anyway? 
the fluoride products used in water fluoridation sodium fluoride or fluorosilicic acid are classified as hazardous waste products of the fertilizer, aluminum, and nuclear industries. they are even more toxic than naturally-occurring fluoride, since they contain other components, such as arsenic and lead. 
however, even naturally-occurring fluoride, in areas with high concentrations over 1 ppm have been found to have extremely adverse health effects. even before additional fluoride is added, the level of natural fluoride in the water in many areas in the u.s. is already equal to the amount of naturally-occurring fluoride that has been found to cause skeletal fluorosis in other countries. studies done in india and china found skeletal fluorosis in areas containing naturally occurring fluoride as low as .07 ppm. gupta r, kumar an, bandhu s, gupta s. 2007 skeletal fluorosis mimicking seronegative arthritis. scandanavian journal of rheumatology 362154-5. that same amount, .07 pmm is the current amount recommended by the cdc to be added to community water supplies. 
in addition to the natural fluoride in groundwater, most people are exposed to multiple sources of fluoride pesticides in wine and food, tea, some ceramics, anti-depressants, pollution from manufacturing, soft drinks, teflon pans, toothpaste etc.. they presumably are being exposed to well over the equivalent of 1 ppm before any fluoride is added to the water, however no industry or government testing has ever been done to find out how much fluoride the public is absorbing from all sources. this massive exposure to fluoride did not exist in the 1950's, when fluoride was first introduced. 
2. don't all advanced countries fluoridate their water? and hasn't it been proven that countries that do fluoridate their water have better dental health than countries that don't? 
no. fluoridation has been almost completely abolished in europe. recently other countries, such as israel and many parts of australia, have discontinued fluoridation. statistics gathered by the world health organization do not show any difference in rates of dental caries in fluoridated vs. non fluoridated countries. who collaborating center for education, training, and research in oral health, malmo univ., sweden, 2012. where fluoridation has been discontinued in communities like canada, the former east germany, cuba and finland, dental decay has not increased but rather has continued to decrease maupome' 2001; kunzel  fischer, 1997, 2000; kunzel 2000; seppa 2000. 
in the u.s., the state of kentucky, which has been fluoridating the longest, and has achieved almost complete fluoridation of its water supply, has the worst dental health of any state in the country. from an article appearing in the lexington herald leader 10142009 ""governor beshear said kentucky led the nation in 2004 in terms of the number of people age 65 or older who had lost teeth. about 27 percent of kentuckians of all ages had lost six or more teeth to decay or gum disease, compared with 18 percent in the rest of the nation."" and yet, in 2004, 99.6 of kentucky's public water systems were providing fluoridated water to their customers. this ranked kentucky first among all states."" kentucky epidemiologic notes and reports, vol. 40. no. 8, dept. of public health. - advertisement - 
similar results were reported in texas ""after 9 years and 3 million of adding fluoride, research shows tooth decay hasn't dropped among the poorest of bexar county's children, it has only increased--up 13 percent this year."" conger j., 2011, san antonio added to our drinking water a chemical 'more toxic than lead? ' kens 5 news. 
for the best article analyzing the research on fluoridation worldwide, see the article by john colquhoun, dds, phd former chief dental officer of auckland, nz why i changed my mind about water fluoridation perspectives in biology and medicine 41 29-44 1997, university of chicago press. colquhoun studied the effects of fluoridation around the world, with the intention of proving how beneficial it was, but discovered, to his astonishment, that people in countries using fluoridation had the worst teeth. he then began crusading to put an end to the practice. 
since 1990, 144 cities have rejected water fluoridation. 
3. where did the idea of fluoridating the water come from? 
industrialists in the aluminum and nuclear industries were under fire because of the harmful effects of the fluoride waste products being emitted from their plants--animals and people were being sickened for miles around. they hired edward bernays, who was the inventor of mass public relations campaigns bernays also happened to be the nephew of sigmund freud to convince the american people that putting toxic waste in our water supply was good for us. - advertisement - 
bernays had organized a successful campaign, on behalf of lucky strike cigarettes, to convince american women that smoking was both glamorous and liberating. he hired models to pose as debutantes in a march for women's rights. when bernays gave the signal, all the women lit up their cigarettes. another successful propaganda campaign that he orchestrated was the overthrow of a democratically-elected government in guatemala on behalf of the united fruit company. the nazis studied and made use of bernays' techniques for their propaganda programs. a more in-depth discussion of bernays' role in the campaign to convince the public to accept fluoridation can be found in the video ""the fluoride deception"" at youtube.com, and the book with the same name by christopher bryson, seven stories press. 
4. ok, so maybe fluoridation hasn't been proven to be effective in improving dental health, but what harm can it do to add it to our water supply? 
first there is the cost factor. at a time when there is no money for schools, dental treatment for kids, support for the homeless and basic community services, counties are spending millions of dollars to fluoridate the water. even worse, fluoridation has been associated with increased rates of kidney disease, alzheimer's, bone cancer, damage to the thyroid, increased bone fractures, hyperactivity, and decreased iq in children. see  . 
although adding hazardous waste to our water is not beneficial to anyone, it is particularly harmful to people with kidney disease who can't excrete it properly, infants when mixed with formula it far exceeds the safe amount of fluoride, farmworkers already exposed to fluoride in pesticides, tea drinkers, people taking anti-depressants, people with low thyroid, and those who have chemical sensitivities. also adversely affected would be people who drink lots of water such as diabetics, athletes, and manual laborers.",127,736267,fake

yes, donald trumps republican running mate mike pence has finally found something hes offended by, but its not donald trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting african americans or mexicans or women or a gold star family. 
nope. 
did pence read the story? no. but hes offended. so offended. because that kind of language is offensive. not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because its not our operation. 
watch here via msnbcs morning joe  
twice saying he hasnt read the article, pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadnt read, thats offensive to me, that kind of language. its not our operation, pence denied. 
donald trump and i want every american who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. and thats our message, is to tell the american people that this country really belongs to them. that we can have government as good as our people again, but its going to take all of us. 
and you saw donald trump  say that people who havent traditionally voted republican, weve got an agenda to bring our cities back 
pence is twice offended, so super offended 
ive never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thats just not the approach donald trump has taken to this campaign. its not the approach were taking. were reaching out to every american. 
pence then claimed independents and even democrats are breaking for trump. in fact trump and pence are even losing groups that voted for mitt romney in 2012. pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame republicans into voting for them by saying, its time for republicans to come home because trump won the primary. 
mike pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because its just not what i see out there. 
trump also loves to cite what he sees and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist  like videos he claims to have watched. 
this explains why mike pence and donald trump ended up together. it turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the republican establishments efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. both pence and trump dont care a whit about facts. this is more than typical campaign spin, its appalling in context. 
the context is that mike pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womans pssy without her permission, but he is publicly saying hes offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. 
pence didnt even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesnt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. but why would he? 
pence didnt care about any of the groups donald trump insulted  not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. but he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. 
like trump, pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior.

"hillary clinton is brilliantly forcing broke trump to spend money defending arizona by jason easley on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 102 pm if donald trump wants to keep arizona in the republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because hillary clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. share on twitter print this post 
if donald trump wants to keep arizona in the republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because hillary clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. 
the clinton announced that the democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in arizona, on wednesday, november 2,  hillary clinton will campaign in phoenix, arizona, days before election day. clinton will lay out what is at stake in the election. with more people voting in this election than any in history, clinton will urge arizona voters to take advantage of in-person early voting. voters can check their registration status and early vote location at iwillvote.com. 
the fact that clinton will be in usually reliably red arizona in november during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race. 
hillary clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue. 
the trump campaign already deployed vp nominee mike pence to utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling, and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving arizona to prevent clinton from winning a state that has been a given for republicans in previous elections. 
the trump campaign is broke. the nominee had to give his campaign 10 million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads. 
the clinton campaign is trying to stretch trump past his breaking point by making a serious play for arizona. it is a brilliant move from a campaign that has outwitted its republican opponent at every turn.",133,736265,real

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan. the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision. donald trump, you see, is racist because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my african-american. hillary clinton, on the other hand, is not anti-semitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a f-ing jew bastard. 
with a republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small, real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass. so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flat-out lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers, as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
in heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear. clinton, a year ago, flat-out said, the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment. to normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. 
meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal, when the accurate description is national security scandal. the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. the law does not require, as fbi director james comey falsely stated, an intent. nor is it relevant, as clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was hacked. 
five people who worked with or for clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. but the target, that is to say hillary clinton, was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. so why the immunity deals? who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares? 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy. this would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie, given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are under-employed. 
meanwhile, its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist gloria allred. allred, a clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers. one such accuser, juanita broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, hillary clinton verbally threatened her. 
hillary clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation. never. and only one national reporter, sam donaldson, has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation. ever. clintons answer? he referred donaldson to his lawyer, david kendall. donaldson quickly tried again, asking the then-president to simply deny it. same answer my attorney  speaks for me. and that was that. 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since 1949; who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk; who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different; whose charitable foundation engaged in pay-to-play in haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and non-donors went to the back of the line; who wants to gut the second amendment; who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis, russia and the chinese; and whose media compadres, including scribes with the new york times, washington post and cnbc, have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign. and she is now odds-on favorite to become the next president of the united states. receive larry elder's commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elder's alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email. name",238,736263,real

conservative house republicans are plotting with one another and openly pining for ryans ouster because he refuses to change the house rules to all more conservative legislation to be passed. the hill is also reporting that conservativehouse republicans are deeply divided on keeping ryan, but donald trump could be the wild card that mobilizing an opposition effort to the speaker, the businessman has repeatedly criticized ryans leadership and was stung after the speaker said he would not longer defend trump after a 2005 tape emerged in which the gop nominee speaks lewdly about groping and kissing women. win or lose on nov. 8, trump could put pressure on house republicans to oppose ryan in a speakership contest. 
ryan is certain to be leading a smaller house majority in january. the size of trumps defeat on election day will help decide how many seats republicans lose. 
eight of the nine house republicans who cast votes against ryan for speaker initially will still be around to vote against him again in january. 
those close to ryan say that he would step down as speaker before getting into a protracted fight with his own party, but the walls are closing in on speaker ryan. 
the damage trump is causing isnt limited to their white house dreams. trump may also cost paul ryan his job as speaker of the house.",133,736264,real
"discrimination and condemnation australias war on boat people email 
the boat, along with other means of travel, are often undertaken as matters of freedom. movement keeps one alive in times of peace, and in conflict. the australian government, and those backing its practices, have wished over the years to limit, if not halt such movement altogether. 
since the last decade, extreme measures have been implemented that effectively qualify australian sovereignty while singling out a particular breed of asylum seeker. the former aspect of that policy was specifically undertaken to excise the entire mainland from being qualified as territorially valid to arrive in. 
the entire policy effectively assumed a military character, most conspicuously under the abbott governments embrace of a creepily crypto-fascist border protection force, equipped with uniforms and patriotic purpose. operation sovereign borders effectively meant that the refugee and asylum seeker were fair game  not to be processed and settled equitably with a minimum of fuss, but to be repelled, their boats towed back to indonesia, and people smugglers bribed. 
an entire intelligence-security complex has also been created, fed by private contractors and held in place by the promise of a two-year prison sentence for entrusted officials in possession of protected information. 
such statements as those made today by prime minister turnbull, announced with note of grave urgency at a press conference, tend to resemble a typical pattern in australian politics since the howard years. 
the borders, even if supposedly secure, are deemed to be in a permanent state of siege, forever battered by potential invaders keen to swindle parliament and the australian people. yes, boasted the abbott, and now turnbull government, the boats laden with desperate human cargo have stopped coming. yes, all is well on the sea lanes in terms of repelling such unwanted arrivals. but for all of this, the island continent is being assaulted by characters of will, those keen to avail themselves of desperate people and their desire for a secure, safe haven. 
the policy has also received international attention from such establishment institutions as the new york times. while that arrangement, went an editorial this month, largely stopped the flow of boats packed with people that set off from indonesia weekly, it has landed these refugees  many from iran, myanmar, iraq and afghanistan  in what amounts to cruel and indefinite detention. 
as the editorial continued to observe, this policy costs australian taxpayers a staggering us419,000 per detainee a year and has made a nation that has historically welcomed immigrants a violator of international law. 
while this obscenity has been powdered and perfumed as humanitarian, designed to halt the spate of drowning cases at sea, the latest announcements have abandoned the stance. they must know, claimed prime minister malcolm turnbull, that the door to australia is closed to those who seek to come here by boat with a people smuggler. 
finally, an honest statement twinning two perceived demons in australian refugee policy the people smuggler and the asylum seeker, both equivalently horrible to australian authorities. to that end, not a single asylum seeker arriving by boat will be permitted to settle in australia. this policy will also affect arrivals from july 2013. 
such a stance of finality seems little different to pervious ones made by abbotts predecessor, kevin rudd. what is troubling about it is the element of monomania never will any asylum seeker, who had arrived after a certain date, will be permitted to settle in australia. 
the intention there is to make sure that those designated refugees on manus island and nauru, facilitated by australias draconian offshore regime, will have the doors shut, effectively ensuring a more prolonged, torturous confinement. absurdly, they will then be permitted to slum away indefinitely in such indigent places as nauru, with a population hostile to those from the middle east and africa. 
turnbulls stance may also suggest a degree of desperation. not all has gone swimmingly with the offshore detention complex. the png supreme court rendered an aspect of the australian refugee policy redundant in finding that detaining individuals indefinitely on manus island breached constitutional rights. 
peter dutton, the hapless minister for immigration, has struggled in managing what can only be described by the border security obsessives as an administrative disaster. rather than admitting to the realities that searching for refuge over dangerous routes will always find a market, the australian government persists in a cruel delusion that continues to deny international refugee law while punishing the victims.",39,736268,fake
"19 men cry rape by iran's top quran reader print saeed toosi, right, and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal, the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping 19 of his students and charged with advocating corruption. 
saeed toosi, 46, winner of the first prize for reading the quran, both internationally and locally, fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi, reported al arabiya. 
in an audio recording, toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and, together with the head of irans judicial authority, had agreed to a cover-up to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime. 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts. the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a much-needed dose of truth about the religion of peace. 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake. one of the victims  a recent first-place winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was 12 while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition. the mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. 
all victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions. 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei, current supreme leader of iran. he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan. last may, toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council, with many of irans top officials in attendance. 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man. 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality, sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture, causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced. the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic. 
according to the reformist amad news, officials held a two-hour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast. the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged. 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani, whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents, defended the regimes handling of the case, london guardian reported. larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story, so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not. 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling, though there will be no public trial. awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation. 
toosi, who has denied the charges against him  calling them total lies meant to discredit irans religious institutions and the ayatollah  is reportedly threatening to release the names of 100 of irans top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children, if the prosecution proceeds.",238,736264,real

"women only hate female objectification when they can no longer profit from it with her hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up, former charmed actress and constantly near-naked attention-seeker rose mcgowan is now a leading feminist. as you would expect, this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of co-star alyssa milano had well and truly begun to fade. mcgowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift. pamela anderson and professional sjw natasha devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying, often very successfully, to sexualize their youth.
seeking to cash in on her new-found fame as an unhinged sjw, rose mcgowan launched the rose army, a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification. full sjw mode is just a button away for her. for instance, she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and, probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity, claimed an x-men movie poster promoted violence against women .
so now comes the task of reconciling the new rose mcgowan with the old one, whose self-objectification is best described by this infamous photo with ex-boyfriend marilyn manson

excuses, excuses rose mcgowan has tried to gloss over her past history of self-objectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy.
mcgowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds, such as with a fellow charmed actress, shannen doherty, on patriarchy, sexism and female objectification . sadly, this very public attention-seeking, in which mcgowan wrote doherty an open letter, comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer . but, you know, a girls gotta attention-whore, including when another girl she used to have cat-fights with is about to die.
rose mcgowan has a lot in common with pamela anderson. ex- playboy cover model anderson, after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship, has now come out against pornography . she may not be bad for a gal nearing 50, but her best years are a good 20-25 years behind her. i would wager that pamela anderson hit 45 and spent the last several years in denial, before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her. pornography addictions are bad, but anderson showing these new colors in 2016 is nothing short of a joke.
andersons position can be summed up by the following two pictures
time when she did not condemn pornography 

time when she condemns pornography 

previously, a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists. these activists are nominally against the sexualization of women, but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females. whilst there is a lot of truth to this, it only tells part of the story. the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle. and what better time to turn on these industries, whether they be the pornography, film, or modeling markets, than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them?
this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization . attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing on-court clothing, which is much more for show than practicality. but when the chance presents itself, lisicki and others have moaned, like at this years wimbledon , about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin. many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet, but they pick and choose when objectification is bad, just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them.
its not just famous people natasha devon.
many return of kings readers will remember natasha devon from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion mannequins. there seems to have been an eerie timing in devons transition from self-described former model to sjw. she founded a so-called body image education program in 2006, in her mid-twenties. i dont know about you, but this seems to be the sort of age when non-famous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger, fresher girls.
as she hurtled towards 30, natasha devon penned an article for cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia, which morphed into a regular monthly column. then came the self-esteem team devon created in 2012. frequently with government funding, the self-esteem team has essentially applauded obesity, britains number one health crisis, and sought to re-engineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive.
devon, along with anderson and mcgowan, may chalk an anti-objectification epiphany down to age, experience or something similarly convenient, but the changes happened neither at the height of their self-sexualization careers nor during the pre-wall protracted slide. always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism.
when a woman complains about the objectification of women, it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with, b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls, or c her goods are well and truly gone. there is a delicious irony to option c, as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a half-decade of alcohol or drug-fueled benderstakes them away.
feminism as projection 
it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs. of anyone, roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most, all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings say.
we need to turn this idea of projection against feminists, even more than we have before. modern-day feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh, uncertain world. for women whose looks are now washed-up, feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to.
rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil, it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant.

"far worse than the fourth reich  the day of reckoning has arrived! with a supplemantry note by lasha darkmoon on the transhumanist depopulation agenda we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january 20, 2017. their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief. the day of reckoning has arrived.  vid rebel i never said i supported donald trump because i liked where he wanted us to go. i did say i was interested in the anger of the bernie sanders and donald trump voters. on election night a bbc reporter tried to explain how hillary lost that state which has a huge black vote and lots of technically advanced people from out of state in what americans call research-triangle park. obama went there in a last ditch effort to get out the vote. he was popular there amongst the college students. they had voted for him in 2012 but not so much for hillary in 2016. the bbc reporter told us the people who lived there said they were all bernie voters. they had zero enthusiasm for hillary. 
i previously quoted mike rivero who had said that if hillary clinton were running in november against godzilla, the lizard would have his vote. we have seen the hillary kool-aid drinkers go crazy after donald won. they all live in bubbles where it would have been career suicide to say you voted against hillarys pay for pay corruption. 
i have seen a lot of domestic anti-trump propaganda from the far right because donald is a zionist. i agree with donald that we should stop funding isis and let vladimir putin take them down. it was obama who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in 2014 and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria. but i do disagree with donalds intention to confront iran. for what? resisting zionism? 
but fortunately for iran, what trump and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant. of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states. 
i have just now seen from europe sheer post-election idiocy. some are claiming that donald trump is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the same industrialists and money men that had elevated adolf hitler to the chancellorship in 1933. 
it is silly to think that the rockefellers and the rothschilds backed trump. 
i do admit that america is run by a criminal elite. i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given donald a green light to dish out dirt on hillary. these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought hillary was one witch too far to go. 
i have reported on the elite end game many times before. their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief. far worse. 
the people who had owned the governments in the west until recently were the 30 families and their 6,000 minions. that is according to david rothkopf, the former ceo of kissinger associates and author of superclass. 
fortunately for us, the people of the us and europe are learning to resist. 
i voted once in a presidential election where the democrat was a member of the trilateral commission headed by david rockefeller in north america and sir evelyn de rothschild in europe. the republican was a member of the bilderberg society headed by sir evelyn de rothschild in europe and headed by david rockefeller in north america. you never read that in our corporate media. 
please do not call those people who run hollywood and our tv news nazis. they are either jewish or work for jewish companies.the direct ties of those who thought they were born to rule over us are more to banking than to industry. they are not nazis.    the transhumanist depopulation agenda ld  in a breakthrough interview on the transhumanist agenda and the 2016 presidential election, catherine austin fitts, former us assistant housing secretary and publisher of the solari report, spoke of the engineered rise of autism, gmo proliferation, the expansion of entrainment technology, the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics, and the dumbing down of american students with common core. see here . these were all, she argued, part of an overarching conspiracy to promote a massive transhumanist depopulation agenda. this would be achieved by an engineered economic armageddon, leading to mass starvation, food riots and race wars that would wipe billions of people off the face of the planet. how soon this apocalyptic scenario is likely to unfold is anyones guess. any moment now, many doomsayers declare. the coming of donald trump is regarded by many as an omen of the end days. ld vid rebel continues 
catherine austin fitts said the bankers stole 50 trillion from us. i think they stole a lot more. 
the bankers gave themselves the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing in 1694 when they founded the bank of england. america copied the bank of england and the german central bank when they drafted the legislation for the federal reserve in 1910. it became law in 1913 just in time for america to create enough unpayable debt at interest to fund ww i. 
the united states entered ww i because the elite did not want the allies to accept germanys offer to stop the fighting in 1915. the elite wanted the war to last long enough to bankrupt britain and france, to set up a jewish communist dictatorship in russia and to make palestine a british colony for the jews. none of that benefited voters in europe or america. and the bought and paid for media cannot understand why we despise both them and the 30 families that sent them. 
we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january 20, 2017. 
the elite stole all of our pensions and savings. they sold hundreds of trillions in bad bets otherwise known as credit default swaps just so they could pocket tens of trillions of dollars in premiums. dont cry for them. they made people like you i.e. taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions. just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund, your savings, your bank account and your paycheck. their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future. at least, that is what they are planning. 
the bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt. the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing. you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing. 
if we had lincolns non-interest bearing greenbacks, we would not have 20 trillion in national debt and be paying 500 billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest. 
the recent sharp rise in the interest rate on 30 year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse. 
a depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse. since we foolishly have a debt based system, that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court. it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment. 
i have quoted dr steve keen many times before. we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past 500 years. 
so what is worse than the fourth reich? tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat. 
in short, a race war to end all wars. 
of course this is what americas elite had planned for them. they stole all of the pension funds and the savings. they created the trade deals that closed 58,000 manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas. they added 55 million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration. they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire 30.6 million federal, state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work. they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning. 
the day of reckoning has arrived. 
the 30 year treasury bonds interest rate at 3 is at record highs for recent years. that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us. it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long. 
the only exit path i see, is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country. 
and the junior officers in the military must respond by arresting bankers and seizing their assets to fund debt cancellation. 
only debt cancellation will provide a painless way out of the coming financial collapse.",44,736289,fake

"in the first 19 days of october, trump gave just 31k to his own campaign by hrafnkell haraldsson on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 919 am with the election just 10 days away, trump has only donated just 56m of the 100m he promised and won't even invest in his own campaign share on twitter print this post 
you have got to wonder if the trump campaign wishes it had spent less on hats and more on polling now, as it is revealed they had only 16m left in their war chest on october 19 compared to clintons 62m. probably not. there are always others to blame and trumps list of those plotting against him grows in inverse proportion to his polling numbers. 
from june 2015 through september 2016, the trump campaign, meaning donald trump, spent 3.2m on hats according to fec filings . they spent just 1.8m on polling. unsurprisingly, they are behind on polling, leading in precisely zero 0 polls . you want to win an election? you need sweet hats"" -abraham lincoln 
trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling pic.twitter.com4tof5dq1mq 
 jack minor jr. jackminorjr october 26, 2016 
and now clinton has four times the cash. 
and the washington post is reporting that in the first 19 days of october, trump only raised half as much as clinton according to campaign finance reports. his biggest day was the 11.5 million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released, which tells you all you need to know about his base. 
remember when trump claimed he would give 100m of his own money to his campaign? yeah, this is a guy who wont even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia. he uses other peoples money for that. with the election just 10 days away, he has only donated 56m. 
make what you will of this, but he had been giving 2m a month to his campaign. in the first 19 days of october? just 31k in in-kind contributions. thats right even trump wont invest in his own campaign at this point. 
trump pulled in 61m up to october 19, down from 100m in september. meanwhile, the clinton campaign has pulled in a cool 101m in that same period. she spent less than normal, 54m, but that leaves her a war chest of 153m going into the final stretch. 
donald trump says he is a great businessman, yet he has spent twice as much on collateral including hats as he has on paying his staff. he says he gets only the best people. and he bought a lot of his maga hats. his campaign site only sells 18 different styles of hat at 20 to 30 apiece. 
and according to huffington post , the october 15 federal election commission filing for trump make america great again committee shows trump spent 300k of donors money to buy his own book  presumably the art of the deal. he profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments, and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the 22 book at 184 each. 
his campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters, yet trump told a crowd in geneva, ohio that hillary clinton has never earned an honest dollar, well i think thats really, you know 
trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the white house while turning a personal profit. 
now it looks as though trump has seen a point of diminishing returns. he not only did not self-fund his campaign as promised, he has barely spent half of what he said he would spend, down to almost nothing at all as defeat looms and the potential for profit evaporates.

"freedom rider russophobia war party propaganda tweet widget b y bar editor and senior columnist margaret kimberley 
the worlds most reactionary regime, the head-chopping, terror-sponsoring saudi arabian kleptocracy, was awarded the chair of the un human rights council, while russia has been kicked out. the travesty was engineered by the superpower of lies to punish moscow for resisting the u.s.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in syria. the war party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media  and hillary hasnt even been elected yet. freedom rider  russophobia war party propaganda b y bar editor and senior columnist margaret kimberley 
 all attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the u.s. and nato and sealed the fate of the syrian people. 
did russia invade iraq and kill one million people? does russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? did russia occupy haiti after kidnapping its president? are russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? is russia entering its 20 th year of a terror war against the people of somalia? all of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the united states. yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to america in violating human rights. 
the dangers presented by a hillary clinton presidency cannot be overstated. she and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against russia. 
nearly every claim of russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. it isnt clear if clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. perhaps they believe that vladimir putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. 
 regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against russia. 
the unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on russia as the sole cause of suffering in syria are meant to desensitize the public. it is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. the usual suspects are helping out eagerly. the corporate media, led by newspapers like the new york times and washington post , are front and center in pushing tales of russian villainy. human rights watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the united states and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim. 
russia lost its seat on the united nations human rights council in part because of american pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. the unhrc is now chaired by saudi arabia. saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 syrian deaths. the saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in yemen, too, but they are american allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds. 
the openly bigoted donald trump has been the perfect foil for hillary clinton. that is why she and the rest of the democratic party leadership preferred him as their rival. he made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with russia made him even more useful. 
 newspapers like the new york times and washington post, are front and center in pushing tales of russian villainy. 
the united states and its allies are the cause of syrias destruction. their effort to overthrow president assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with isis and al nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. far from being the cause of the catastrophe russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. they even made overtures to negotiate assads fate with the united states. all attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the u.s. and nato and sealed the fate of the syrian people. the people of east aleppo are being shelled by american allies but one wouldnt know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. the american role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. the bloodshed was made in the u.s. and could end if this government wanted it to. 
the anti-russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. nato is massing troops on russias borders in a clear provocation yet putin is labeled the bad guy. he is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. the united states makes phony claims of russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. the latest human rights watch canards about prosecuting assad come straight from the white house and state department and have nothing to do with concern for syrians living in their fifth year of hell. 
donald trump has been the perfect foil for hillary clinton. 
there is no lesser evil between hillary clinton and donald trump. she is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more muscular foreign policy. that bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if clinton wins in a landslide. she must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. peace loving people must give their votes to the green party ticket of jill stein and ajamu baraka. they are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars. 
the united states is the most dangerous country in the world. if it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. that is the prospect we face with a hillary clinton presidency. if the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show. margaret kimberley's freedom rider column appears weekly in bar, and is widely reprinted elsewhere. she maintains a frequently updated blog as well as at  ms. kimberley lives in new york city, and can be reached via e-mail at margaret.kimberleyatblackagendareport.com.",25,736270,fake
"trump reopening 911, reversing rome, in bid to be greatest american steward? trump reopening 911, reversing rome, in bid to be greatest american steward? by daily bell staff - november 11, 2016 
trump im reopening 911 investigation  first of all, the original 911 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened, trump said  donald trump believes that 911 has not been properly investigated and has promised to find out what really happened when he takes office in january. donald trumps plans for his first 100 days in office are raising eyebrows around the world, but of all the items on his agenda it is the reopening of the 911 investigation that will provide the greatest earthquake for the establishment. -yournewswire 
is new president-to-be donald trump really going to make major moves to roll back globalism? 
weve indicated that one way or another the establishment wished for donald trump to be elected. in our view, they certainly have the power  and we think brexit offers a similar story. 
the idea is that the various military and economic disasters pent-up around the world will be released and blamed on peoples impulse to flee global technocracy. 
in this way the elite takeover of the world continues under the cover of politics. 
this process of inflicting disaster has already begun with the so-called riots taking place in the us. there are certainly reports these riots and general civil unrest are not in all cases genuine. 
one can spot, perhaps, soros funding and even crisis actors. but the idea is to make it clear that populists are bitterly resented by many if not most americans. 
of course, trump has little to do with populism. there is a specific globalist agenda that has been implemented around the world and certainly in america. 
this agenda involves trade deals that drain away american prosperity; too-low interest rates that create inflation, stock markets crashes and ongoing depression; and a variety of rules, regulations and cover ups designed to concentrate power into fewer and fewer hands. 
this agenda is what trump is apparently taking aim at. if he follows through on some of his recent statements and positions we cant imagine the secret rulers of america and the west will be too happy with his ascension. 
911 is at the bottom of much of modern globalist cover-up. it trump reveals the truth about 911, the globalist movement based on in london with tentacles throughout the west will likely collapse or at least become far less powerful. 
more 
trump believes that 911 has not been properly investigated and he plans to get to the bottom of it. first of all, the original 911 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened, trump said.  
the election of donald trump has rocked the establishment and things are only going to get rockier for them during his first term. there is a reason george w. bush didnt vote for trump in the election, leaving the presidential line blank and voting republican down-ballot. 
trump has pledged to investigate 911 in a way it has not been investigated before. for the first time 911 will be investigated by someone who isnt part of the establishment, with skin in the game and plenty to lose. 
of course, despite such reports, there remains considerable skepticism on the net that trump will follow through on a re-investigation of 911. for one thing, his campaign is close to rudy giuliani who helped apparently orchestrate the original cover-up. 
in researching trumps most recent comments on 911, we also find net claims that trumps intentions regarding 911 have been revealed on satire sites and and have not been reported in the mainstream. but in fact there is a growing list of reports affirming his intentions regarding 911, including an article posted at dailystar.co.uk. 
take trump at his word and the 911 re-investigation is only one of numerous ant-globalist moves that trump intends to make. it is emerging he has a long list of globalist rollbacks in mind. 
on his transition website greatagain.gov, trump presents some of them. he wants to significantly cut taxes, cut regulation, push back against the fake climate change movement, get rid of obamacare, build the wall, between the us and mexico and reduce or remove unconstitutional executive orders. 
generally he claims to want to make government less intrusive and destructive. this is certainly not the direction the us government has been traveling for decades and even centuries. 
trump also wants to build up the america military  last seen mislaying 8 trillion. but while he wants to give the us military more funding which it doesnt need he also wants to reduce or eliminate the endless serial wars that the pentagon has been engaging in for the past half-century. 
as a libertarian publication, we can think of a lot more that trump could try to do. he could try to get rid of the federal reserve entirely, close up americas military bases around the world, reduce or remove the federal justice system and its prison system that incarcerates 25 percent of the worlds prison population at any one time. 
while hes at it, he could get rid of laws making drugs illegal and other laws regulating behaviors that benefit no one but americas burgeoning, authoritarian police strucure. 
basically, the closer that trump can bring the country back to its original constitution, the better. freedom produces prosperity and the constitution which wasnt actually needed either at least codified limits on the federal government. 
weve argued regularly for years that individual freedom cannot be gained or regained via the political process. politics inevitably reduce freedom, no matter the intentions of politicians. 
additionally, empires like america are probably impossible to roll back and this has likely never happened in the history of humankind. if trump really means to do what he says he will, and sticks to his word, he will be that rarest of all creatures a politician who keeps his word. 
he will also reintroduce real freedom into america and begin the significant crushing of the globalist conspiracy. again we find all this hard to believe given that globalist control from what we can tell of much of western society and trillions of dollars via the central bank system. intelligence agencies and secret societies also seem to be under globalist control. 
conclusion given the enemies he faces and the challenges he needs to surmount, trump will need to have more courage and determination than we can begin to contemplate. but if he really intends to follow through and manages to make significant difference, he will go down as americas greatest president.",175,736279,fake

while visiting a chilis restaurant in cedar hills, texas, u.s. army veteran ernest walker was approached by the manager and had his military service questioned even though he had his military id with him. chilis offers free meals to veterans on veterans day as a thank you for their service, but what walker received was anything but. 
noticing what was happening, walker took out his phone and began to record everything that was being said to him. at one point, even his food was stripped away from him. theres really no other way to see this than an act of racism, and chilis needs to answer for it. 
walker wrote on facebook  
i went there to get a veterans meal and all was good. i had my service dog with me because i am on dialysis and he monitors my bp. i ordered the waitress was wonderful. it took about 35 mins for meal to come. so when it attived i gave her a tip as asjed for a take out. she said sure, at that point a old white guy wearing a trump flag shirt walked buy me on hi way to the bath room. he came back and aked me what unit did i serve in the 24th. i said no the 25th. he said he was in world war 2 in germany and we did not see people like you over there. they would no allow blacks. i just listened he left then came back to bathroom again and pet my dog. so waitress put foid in container. then the managers comes and says a somes guest at the restaurant say that your not a real soldier. i reply what are you serious what guest. the manager wesly patrick said can i see military id. i felt that was reasonable i most people ask for that so i shoed him my id it checked out. at that point all he should have said was sir i am sorry thank you for your service and i would have left. but instead ge says  tbe guest also says that your service dog is not a service dog. now thats when igot upset and started recording so see for yourself what happened. 
watch the altercation here 
chilis did respond by saying  
we are aware of the situation that happened at our chilis cedar hills location yesterday. our goal is to make every guest feel special. unfortunately, we fell short on a day we strive to honor our veterans and active military for their service. we have escalated this to the highest levels of our company.

"dozens of groups call on facebook to end censorship dozens of groups call on facebook to end censorship posted on oct 31, 2016 
by deirdre fulton  common dreams facebook had more than 1 billion monthly active users in the second quarter of 2016.  flickr  cc 2.0  
as facebook comes under fire for its alleged censorship and tracking of activists and protesters, a coalition of more than 70 groups and individuals has demanded the social media behemoth clarify its policy on removing video and other content, especially human rights documentation, at the request of government actors. 
a letter whose signatories include the american civil liberties union aclu, 350.org, color of change, and the indigenous environmental networksent monday cites recent incidents including the deactivation of korryn gaines account, the removal of iconic photographs, reports of suppression of indigenous resistance , continued reports of black activists content being removed, and the disabling of palestinian journalists accounts. 
these instances of censorship clearly point to the gaps in facebooks automation and content guidelines, said nicole carty of the consumer watchdog sumofus, which coordinated the letter. in order to mitigate these issues, facebook must recognize these broader policy failures as human rights and free speech issues. from black lives matter in the united states to journalists in palestine, facebooks lack of transparency has resulted in reports of censorship on almost a weekly basis, which proves that this is not an individualized glitch but a broader policy problem. 
advertisement square, site wide 
at the same time, the letter notes that with the launch of the live-streaming video function facebook live, the site is taking on an increasingly central role in controlling media that circulates through the public sphere. news is not just getting shared on facebook its getting broken there. 
in turn, the letter reads, 
we believe that taking urgent action to increase transparency and protect users is the first step to reaching our shared vision of the world. it is important not only for the integrity of its platform and the trust of its community of users, but also for the future of our media. because the stories that dont get shared are as important as the ones that do. 
social media platforms are increasingly becoming the avenues for free speech, which makes ending censorship by companies like facebook all the more critical, added chinyere tutashinda, national organizer at the center for media justice. we are calling on facebook to create policies that protect the most marginalized voices on their platforms communities of color and low-income communities in the u.s. and across the globe. 
specifically, the letter calls on facebook to make policies about how facebook makes decisions to censor content clear and accessible to the public whether those requests are from third-party agencies or through its algorithmespecially with respect to live broadcasting and journalistic content. create a public appeals platform where users can appeal content censored by facebook. undergo an external audit on the equity and human rights outcomes of your facebook live and content censorship and data sharing policies. refuse to disclose customer content and data to third-party agencies unless required to by law. 
notably, the letter came on the same day that scores of facebook users attempted to use the sites check-in feature as a way to help shield dakota access pipeline opponents by confusing law enforcement. while the fact-checking website snopes largely debunked the strategy , it also quoted representatives from sacred stone camp as saying that they support the tactic, and think it is a great way to express solidarity. tags",207,736268,fake

for the last eight years, one of the most ambitious men in politics has been new jersey governor chris christie. hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teachers unions in new jersey  brash language about punching them in the face marked his rise as a political force and an up-and-comer in presidential politics  christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the republican party in two straight presidential elections. 
in 2012, christie was considered and rejected for vice president by mitt romney  but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the republican convention. there, he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders, ignoring romney completely. fox news chris wallace called the speech the most curious keynote speech i have ever heardfor a moment i forgot who was the nominee of the party. 
then, the week before the election, hurricane sandy hit the east coast. while new york governor andrew cuomo told president obama that his presence was unnecessary, christie invited obama to new jersey, then hugged him and took him on a tour of atlantic city, where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies. i cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state, christie said, adding that it was my honor to introduce president obama. christie was, at the time, facing down rumors that then-newark mayor corey booker, who is black, would run against him. as the new york times noted, the scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management  only it was run free of charge. 
obama surged in the final days and beat romney handily. 
fast forward three years. 
christie was running in the republican primaries. hed done nothing much in the polls; his only hope was to somehow do well in new hampshire. he had no support in states like south carolina or nevada, or southern states dominated by support for donald trump, ted cruz, and marco rubio. so, naturally, he used his presence at the debate before the new hampshire primary  a state in which rubio was surging following his iowa showing  to destroy rubio. christie rightly labeled rubio a robotic candidate, rubio repeated himself, christie hit him again  and rubio fell apart in the polling. trump ran away with the state. almost immediately, christie quit the race and fell in behind trump. thanks in large part to christies help, trump won the nomination. 
now, with trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against hillary clinton, christie has struck again this time, two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to bridgegate, the scandal in which the christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local democrat who wouldnt endorse christies re-election bid . this story will allow the media to shift its focus to the trump campaign, since christie is leader of trumps white house transition team. in a tight election, it could be enough to hand hillary the white house. 
so thanks, chris christie.

"why 'never trumpers' must reconsider while democrats perpetually circle the wagons, republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad. the same holds true for many evangelicals. democrats and secularists count on it. 
and we never disappoint. 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and, finally, settled as a reluctant trumper. i, like any god-fearing father of daughters was, and remain, appalled by donald trumps sordid past, and his 11-year-old vulgar video in which he objectified women. his words are indefensible, and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day. 
still, i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov. 8 in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote, for better or worse, for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov. mike pence. 
regrettably, with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith. pride is an awful thing. we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew 1016. foolishness called faith is just foolishness. 
even so, there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first, those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again! pablum and deride any person who, while not casting judgment upon others, makes, with all sincerity, what they view as the principled decision. the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard. while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity, i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong. 
and then there are the self-righteous, plank-in-the-eye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltiness,sinned against god and compromised their principles, brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity. 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service. in 2014 the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate, stared into the camera with cold, callous eyes, and then both lied about and defended unequivocally. i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov. 8. 
mrs. clintons beloved late-term abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the left-leaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances, not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother. 
during a partial-birth abortion, the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb, leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal. this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion, rather than committing murder. 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors, piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt. next, he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands, inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains, thereby collapsing her skull. 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage. 
this is homicide, plain and simple. hillary clinton supports it. donald trump opposes it. 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch. in my estimation, mrs. clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity. her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner. 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs. clinton and ensure that she is stopped. she must not be elected president. to not vote  or to vote for a non-starter third party candidate, which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs. clinton, still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court. 
its simple math, and its undeniable. the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs. clinton by voting for mr. trump. this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations. 
with its 1973 roe v. wade decision, the u.s. supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder. since then, the battle lines have been drawn. this is war. pro-choicers are the bad guys and pro-lifers, the good guys. it really is that simple  that black and white. its good versus evil. 
history will reflect as much. 
under a president hillary clinton, millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive. under a president donald trump, these millions might live. and yet, even as hillary sharpens her knives, we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth. 
the devil and democrats oh, how they love derision and division within the body of christ.",238,736264,real
"184 u.s. generals and admirals endorse trump for commander-in-chief have you seen that pro-hillary tv ad of disgraced gen. john allen? 
nauseating. 
you should know that in 2011, allen, then a 4-star general in the u.s. marine corps, was nominated to be natos supreme allied commander, europe, pending confirmation by the senate. on november 13, 2012, defense secretary leon panetta suspended allens confirmation hearing, pending investigations into the generals inappropriate communication with a woman named jill kelley. gen. john allen l; jill kelley r 
as part of the fallout of the gen. david petraeus -paula broadwell affair, the fbi uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of correspondence  mostly email  between allen and kelley from 2010 to 2012. reportedly, their correspondence was flirtatious and inappropriate as allen and kelley were both married at the time, but not to each other. 
seriously, how can a 4-star general even have so much free time as to write 20,000 to 30,000 emails in the space of two years to anyone? 20,000 emails mean an average of 28 emails a day exchanged between allen and kelley; 30,000 emails mean an average of 42 emails a day. there is no one with whom ive exchanged 28 emails a day, even less 42 emails. 
the upshot not only did john allen lose his confirmation as natos supreme allied commander, he also lost his job as commander of u.s. forces in afghanistan  a post to which he was promoted to replace the disgraced gen. petraeus. see  obama purges u.s. military command part 1  
allen retired from the military in february 2013, but was appointed special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter isil or isis  a post and title created for allen by obama, which allen held for about a year from september 2014 until october 23, 2015. 
allen was a featured speaker at the 2016 democratic national convention in philadelphia. he criticized donald trump and endorsed hillary clinton  who abandoned four americans to die in benghazi  for president. 
like the new yorker that he is, trump fired back, calling allen a failed general. 
trump does have the endorsement of 184 non-failed and non-disgraced u.s. generals and admirals, including at least four 4-star and fourteen 3-star flag officers, as well as the endorsement of 14 medal of honor recipients. 
the endorsements began with an open letter on sept. 6, 2016, from 88 retired u.s. general and admirals  the 2016 election affords the american people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy. as retired senior leaders of americas military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world. for this reason, we support donald trumps candidacy to be our next commander-in-chief. for the past eight years, americas armed forces have been subjected to a series of ill-considered and debilitating budget cuts, policy choices and combat operations that have left the superb men and women in uniform less capable of performing their vital missions in the future than we require them to be. simultaneously, enemies of this country have been emboldened, sensing weakness and irresolution in washington and opportunities for aggression at our expense and that of other freedom-loving nations. in our professional judgment, the combined effect is potentially extremely perilous. that is especially the case if our government persists in the practices that have brought us to this present pass. for this reason, we support donald trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically. we urge our fellow americans to do the same. 
two days later on sept. 8, another 21 retired u.s. generals and admirals joined the list, followed by 31 more the next day, on sept. 9, and another 44 on sept. 16, bringing the total number of flag officers who have endorsed trump to 184.

"president obama gets real, not revenge, on republicans by rmuse on sat, oct 29th, 2016 at 323 pm he is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in republicans' faces.   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
although this campaign season has been interesting, to say the least, there is something happening one never thought would occur. after spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the president of the united states, republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the democratic president whose approval rating and popularity are growing. 
it is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic republican candidate for the presidency, but for some gop candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. if any republican believed president obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election. 
the president is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of donald trump. president obama is also reminding republicans that  donald trump is the endpoint of eight years of gop toxic hostility . it may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that  obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every republican who ever crossed him , but he is getting some well-placed and well-warranted shots at republicans. 
two republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the presidents approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics; so it likely stunned the president that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. 
ohio senator rob portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the president to break the grip of heroin addiction. president obama took the time to excoriate portman for, 
 finally withdrawing his support from donald trump , but only  after looking at the polling. now that its politically expedient. but he has supported him up until last week? so i guess it was ok when trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that mexicans were rapists  and insulting gold star moms, making fun of disabled americans. i guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge. why was that ok? and now he says he will vote for the vice-presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports donald trump.  
the president was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the president  one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times, california republican representative daryl issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the presidents face on them and boasting about his close work with president obama  to protect victims of sexual assault . 
daryl issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the presidents wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on issa-created scandals. during a fundraiser in la jolla california sunday last, the president assailed issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the presidents image on it. the president said, 
 issas primary contribution to the united states congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. this is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. now that is the definition of chutzpah. 
as remarked by tim murphy at mother jones, president obama is not just evening up the score with republicans who made his tenure miserable,  he is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in republicans faces . 
the president clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue republicans with. he said , 
 heres the thing. for years, republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. about hillary. about harry. they said i wasnt born here. they said climate change is a hoax. they said that i was going to take everybodys guns away! they said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. this is what theyve been saying for years now! so people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true! and if the world theyve been seeing is im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though i cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like donald trump? 
and the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. there are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base, itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do, we wont be able to appoint judges, well gum up the works, well create gridlock, itll give us a political advantage. so they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. so donald trump did not start this. donald trump didnt start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. thats what he always does. and so now, when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line, all of a sudden these republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away. oh, this is too much. so when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly thats a deal-breaker. well what took you so long! what the heck! what took you so long! all these years! 
the mother jones piece made out like president obama is seeking retribution, or  revenge  against republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. without knowing what goes on in the presidents head to motivate his campaign rhetoric; that is a hard call to make with any surety. barack obama does not strike one as being vindictive. 
the president is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the white house is winding down and republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from donald trump, it is prudent of the president to remind voters exactly what republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why donald trump is their standard bearer; and why republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the white house.",133,736266,real
"donald trump destroyed as fact checker reveals trump lies 20 to 37 times per day by hrafnkell haraldsson on mon, oct 31st, 2016 at 759 am in donald trump ""you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days."" share on twitter print this post 
cnns brian stelter calls donald trump a uniquely fact-challenged candidate, which is a prelude to introducing daniel dale, washington correspondent for the toronto star , who fact checks every single word trump utters and tallies them up for his paper . 
dale says most fact-checkers look at two or three things trump says, meticulously fact-checks them and posts an article, but that doesnt work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days. 
for example, dale tallied 35 trump lies on tuesday, october 25 donald trump said 35 false things yesterday. trumpcheck pic.twitter.comewfyfedfx9 
 daniel dale ddale8 october 26, 2016 
which, as dale pointed out , followed his record-tying 37 false claims on monday, not coincidentally, a day on which trump called fact checkers scum. 
watch courtesy of cnns reliable sources ""there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty."" ddale8 says trump lies a lot more than clinton  
 reliable sources reliablesources october 30, 2016 
the mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between trump and clinton. as dale told stelter, there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty. trump, says dale, is not a normal political liar. 
for example, look at the presidential debates , in which dale found 104 trump false statements as opposed to 13 by clinton. 
dales judgment is that there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent. 
trump also lies pointlessly, argues dale, explaining to brian stelter that, 
he gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether hes lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts. 
this was mark cubans complaint, of course, that trump has no interest in learning. 
in the end, it matters less why trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that hillary clinton is the dishonest candidate. and it is working. this is a trope frequently repeated by trumps supporters. you can correct them as often as you want; it will have no effect. 
the lie has taken hold  one of many  many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. the trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as dale tweeted last night, 
if trump loses, the smart republican excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base re-education. 
given the gops history with facts, good luck with that.

"college classmate reveals horrific story of time trump hit his son in the face inside their dorm november 4, 2016 college classmate reveals horrific story of time trump hit his son in the face inside their dorm   
scott melker is a miami-based dj who reportedly attended the university of pennsylvania at the same time as one of the sons of republican presidential nominee donald trump. 
melker recently shared a disturbing story on facebook in which he claims that trump very casually physically assaulted donald trump jr. in front of his classmates, as well as the troubling behaviors of don jr., who he described as a drunk who earned the nickname diaper don. image via facebook 
before we get ahead of ourselves, we should, of course, take it for what it is worth. this is just one mans account, and for all we know, melker could have made the whole thing up. but melkers account doesnt come across as exaggerated, the alleged interaction, while disturbing, seems very understated. 
and heres what we do know about trump. 
he has bragged on video about how he felt his star status gave him permission to routinely sexually assault random women by kissing them and grabbing their genitalia against their will. 
trump has also been accused of committing numerous sexual assaults against women, including raping two young teenage girls. 
and according to his first wife, trump did not have the best of relationships with his three oldest children. during a benefit a few weeks ago, ivana trump told the crowd that she brought up the children singlehandedly. donald wasnt really interested in children until he could talk business with them. 
with so many deep character flaws, its not exactly a stretch of the imagination that he would physically lash out as well. 
if this story turns out to be true, it could explain a lot about why trumps two oldest sons are the way they are, and it could foretell a very troubling future for trumps youngest son barron, who is only 10 years old.

in february podesta moved seamlessly from the white house to become chairman of hillary clintons 2016 presidential campaign. 
here are some of the most explosive revelations from the wikileaks email dumps featuring podestas account and others. 
preference for muslim americans in 2008, when podesta served as co-chair of president-elect barack obamas transition team, michael froman, a former citibank executive, sent podesta a list of african american, latino and asian american candidates, broken down by cabinetdeputy and underassistantdeputy assistant level, plus a list of native american, arabmuslim american and disabled american candidates. the arab american list came with a special note to exclude arab christians  they had to be both arab and muslim.as new republic reports, obamas eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as froman recommended.froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. 
shielding obama in a march 4, 2015, email to hillary clintons lawyer cheryl mills, clintons eventual campaign chairman podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between clinton and president obama that were sent over clintons private server.the day before podesta sent his email to mills, the house benghazi committee privately told clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.the email from podesta to mills says think we should hold emails to and from potus? thats the heart of his exec privilege. we could get them to ask for that. they may not care, but it seems like they will. an email exchange between podesta, paul begala, and clinton pollster gqrr shows the clinton campaign was pushing the muslim obama narrative back in january 2008. included was a survey of obama negative facts such as this one obama owe-bahm-uhs father was a muslim and obama grew up among muslims in the worlds most populous islamic country. the pollster writes we have reworked the obama message into the survey, as requested. 
secret speeches to wall street hillary clinton was so enraged that bill clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at wall street bank morgan stanley in 2015 that she needed a cool down period. the email chain, on march 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both hillary clinton and former president clinton, and reveals that hillarys future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of bill giving a speech to a wall street bank. morgan stanley is coming down, wrote robby mook in an email to top clinton aides.top aide huma abedin explained that hillary would not be happy about it, writing hrc very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. i will have to tell her that bill chose to cancel it, not that we asked. hillary clintons paid speeches to goldman sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this years primary, were the subject of an email to podesta. excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by clintons research team, including the necessity of having both a public and a private position on issues. it was just part of making sausage in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. some flags in hillary clintons paid speeches were noted in a jan. 25 email from campaign research director tony carrk to top clinton advisers, including clintons declaration that my dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere. countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as fact checkers tried to downplay this email by saying it was mostly about trade, not immigration, as if the words open borders were never mentioned. but the email exchange also shows how hillarys about-face on the tpp trade deal was mere pandering to bernie sanders voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. in a speech at goldman-black rock on feb. 4, 2014, carrk pointed out, clinton admitted shes kind of far removed from middle-class struggles due to the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and i now enjoy. clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to wall street, an issue primary opponent bernie sanders continually raised. clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting donald trump for not releasing his tax returns. 
working in tandem with friendly media wnd reported tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for hillary clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. univision chairman haim saban urged the clinton campaign to hit donald trump harder over immigration. the boston globe tried to time a clinton opinion piece to do the most good in new hampshire. cnbcs john harwood urged clinton campaign chairman podesta to watch out for then-gop candidate dr. ben carson. democratic national committee official and cnn contributor donna brazile apparently tipped off the clinton campaign to a potentially difficult cnn town-hall question on capital punishment during the democratic party primary season. brazile adamantly denies it . in a july 2015 email, new york times reporter mark leibovich appeared to ask permission from hillary clintons communications director, jennifer palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference clinton made to sarah palin and delete clintons statement, and gay rights has moved much faster than womens rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon. cnbc correspondent john harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to donald trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the clinton campaign, emailing podesta with the subject line watch out. the warning was regarding gop presidential candidate ben carson, who could give you real trouble in a general election. maggie haberman, a former politico reporter who now works for the new york times, was described in a january 2015 memo as having a very good relationship with the clinton campaign. we have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed, the memo said. 
demeaning catholics podesta discussed fomenting revolution in the catholic church with a progressive activist while hillarys now-communications director jennifer palmieri mocked catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the democratic party. there needs to be a catholic spring, in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church, sandy newman, president and founder of the nonprofit voices for progress, wrote podesta in february 2012 . the email, among the third batch released by wikileaks, was titled opening for a catholic spring? just musing. podesta tells newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this, the clinton campaign chairman writes. but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now. likewise catholics united. like most spring movements, i think this one will have to be bottom up. clinton, who has accused trump of praising putin, called the russian leader in a 2014 speech engaging and a very interesting conversationalist. excerpts from clintons speeches were contained in a document emailed to podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. 
collusion with doj clinton spokesman brian fallon alerted staffers that the justice department was proposing to publish clintons work-related emails, contending it showed collusion between the obama administration and clintons campaign. fallon wrote that doj folks told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october, podesta met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including peter kadzik, a top official at the justice department. lawyers also told the clinton campaign in emails that hillarys private email scandal  smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing ive either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc . 
entanglements with foreign governments king muhammad iv of morocco made a 12 million pledge to fund the clinton global initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. hillarys top aide, huma abedin, wrote in a january 2015 email that if hrc was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. then she warned she created this mess and she knows it. hillary ended up not attending but her husband bill did. an email from hillary clintons account to podesta on aug. 17, 2014, said saudi arabia and qatar were providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isis and other radical sunni groups in the region. critics have pointed out that the clinton foundation has received considerable funding from the two middle east nations. in a leaked 2013 paid speech to the jewish united fund of metropolitan chicago, hillary said jordan and turkey cant possibly vet all those refugees so they dont know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees. two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of syrian refugees coming to the u.s. largely from united nations refugee camps in jordan. 
insiders insider had sway over dnc a wikileaks email dump on july 22 revealed that debbie wasserman schultz used her position as head of the dnc to work in concert with the clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of sen. bernie sanders, d-vt. schultz was forced to resign over the emails. issues used to undermine sanders campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. the clinton campaign tried to reschedule the illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate republican would get a boost following the super tuesday primaries. the clintons wont forget what their friends have done for them, wrote robby mook, who later became clintons campaign manager, in the november 2014 email to podesta.",238,736264,real
"comment on genius child arrested, interrogated, and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock by brian hodge home  badge abuse  genius child arrested, interrogated, and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock genius child arrested, interrogated, and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock john vibes september 16, 2015 326 comments 
irving, tx  an intelligent and talented 9th grader was arrested this week for bringing a homemade clock into school. 14-year-old ahmed mohamed is interested in electronics and has taught himself how to make his own radios and other devices. he can even repair his own go-kart. 
recently, he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers. sadly, instead of celebrating his achievement, one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb. 
when the police arrived, they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well, even though it obviously wasnt. eventually, the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb, even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock, and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it. 
the young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center, and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room. he was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of. 
here in high school, none of the teachers know what i can do, ahmed told dallas news after the incident. 
he then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created, he was warned not to show it to the other teachers. 
he was like, thats really nice, i would advise you not to show any other teachers, ahmed said. 
he then kept the clock in his bag until his english class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher. after the class, ahmed showed his teacher what was making the noise, and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school. 
she was like, it looks like a bomb, he said. 
i told her, it doesnt look like a bomb to me, he explained. 
the teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it. however, towards the end of the day, ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers. 
he said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb. 
they were like, so you tried to make a bomb?  ahmed said. 
i told them no, i was trying to make a clock. 
the officer then told him,  it looks like a movie bomb to me. 
the police even admit that ahmed never once said the device was a bomb, and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one, but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something, even though they didnt have any proof. 
we have no information that he claimed it was a bomb. he kept maintaining it was a clock, but there was no broader explanation, police spokesman james mclellan said. 
it could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car. the concern was, what was this thing built for? do we take him into custody? he added. 
they couldnt possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers. 
they thought, how could someone like this build something like this unless its a threat?, ahmed said. 
ahmeds father, mohamed elhassan mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against. 
he just wants to invent good things for mankind, but because his name is mohamed and because of sept. 11, i think my son got mistreated, he said. 
there has since been an outpour of support on social media since ahmeds story went public. he has even gotten support from mark z and president obama. cool clock, ahmed. want to bring it to the white house? we should inspire more kids like you to like science. it's what makes america great.

i did that. as a vietnam vet who spent a great deal of time in the philippines when they were under martial law, life, liberty, and public safety are too precious to let slip. every time a citizen is persecuted, the terrorists win. that is the point of terrorism. destruction alone is not the object. having us turn on each other is. a draconian law enforcement suits the political purposes by creating innocent martyrs. when they violate the laws they are paid to enforce and threaten the public safety they are sworn to protect, we lose our liberty and the terrorists win. john lloyd scharf

"while americans fight over which clown to elect, russia deployed its largest fleet since the cold war having been subjected to the intellectually insulting shit show of a third and, thankfully, final debate between hillary clinton and donald trump  likely the two most despised candidates in u.s. electoral history  its now imperative americans train their attention to rapidly unfolding events which, by every indication, comprise blaring alarm bells of impending world war. 
via anonhq 

and no, despite scaremongering to the contrary, this war  centered around superpowers russia and the united states  would not inevitably devolve into the hurling of nuclear missiles. in fact, the likelihood of no-holds-barred nuclear war is, at best, negligible  but the odds of unhindered conventional warfare have increased markedly over the past week.
scroll down for video below a senior nato diplomat, who spoke with reuters under condition of anonymity and cited western intelligence, gave the startling assessment wednesday that russia is deploying all of the northern fleet and much of the baltic fleet in the largest surface deployment since the end of the cold war.
this is not a friendly port call. in two weeks, we will see a crescendo of air attacks on aleppo as part of russias strategy to declare victory there.
indeed, russian ally syrian president bashar al-assad eagerly accepted president vladimir putins military assistance in its chaotic and complex conflict, which largely involves u.s.-created and saudi arabia-funded islamic state militants; u.s.-trained and armed moderate rebel terrorists; syrian government forces; and the altogether controversial western-backed, saudi-led coalition. considering the decimation taking place, that assistance is absolutely justifiable.
of course, that farcically simplified explanation requires the contextualization of an intricate web of extenuating circumstances  nearly any one of which could spark a powderkeg.
russian military endeavors in syria have already earned a vow by the u.s. to defend itself  and by logical extension, that would include whichever rebel groups it considers moderate enough not to deserve being targeted. with russia planning an all-in offensive, some analysts have warned, the pentagon could facilely decide to undertake direct defensive measures.
at the heart of the u.s. multi-fronted proxy war with russia sits a highly-propagandized, baseless narrative of russian aggression  a claim thoroughly saturating american political rhetoric to shift both focus and blame from the true substantive aggressor the world over the united states.
save for scanty disagreement from western-centric analysts, this american aggression  marked by an obstinate quest for dominance and control  has us all perilously hurtling for needless war on a global scale.
and needless, if not highly suspect, aptly characterizes the u.s. recent destruction of several strategic radar sites inside yemen following dubious claims the u.s.s. mason had come under missile attack by iran-allied shia houthi rebels. although american politicians and corporate media swiftly proffered those claims as steel truth  even amid a nascent investigation by the pentagon  the department of defenses own preliminary statement cast doubt about veracity.
the initial thoughts is that this attack was aimed at them, dod spokesman capt. jeff davis statedshortly after the purported incident last tuesday.
nonetheless, the belligerent move by the u.s. spurred iran to deploy an entire fleet of military vessels to the same gulf of aden waters from whence the response attack had been launched.
now, despite the abrupt and official military entree into the yemeni war, reuters reported, the pentagon declined to say on monday whether the uss mason destroyer was targeted by multiple inbound missiles fired from yemen on saturday, as initially thought, saying a review was under way to determine what happened.
but the u.s. propaganda machine truly hit a fever pitch today, thanks to an altogether shady exclusive report courtesy of reuters  amplifying an altogether unproven claim iran has been directly supplying houthi rebels with missiles, arms, and cash.
in fact an unsurprisingly unnamed and unverifiable senior u.s. administration official delivered an accusation of potentially staggering consequence, telling reuters
we have been concerned about the recent flow of weapons from iran into yemen and have conveyed those concerns to those who maintain relations with the houthis, including the omani government.
oman, of course, flatly denies such allegations.
there is no truth to this, omani foreign minister yousef bin alwi told saudi newspaper okaz in an interview last week. no weapons have crossed our border and we are ready to clarify any suspicions if they arise.
in fact, though reuters cites several anonymous diplomats and officials, the accusation iran has been supplying anything directly to the houthis has yet to be unassailably proven  and such reports do little more than proffer a narrative suitable not only to maintain new u.s. military endeavors in yemen, but to recklessly provoke a proxy iranian conflict.
such psychological operations are, of course, not unusual for the united states  and extend to a statement given by president barack obama on tuesday concerning russia.
in a blatant attempt to discredit donald trump for a supposed fondness for putin, obama, as usual, invoked the russian aggression narrative  however, this spiel came complete with a pointedly significant re-characterization about the russian military.
we think that russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage rather than part of the problem, the president explained, surreptitiously upgrading the cold war foes capabilities than its previous status as mere regional power in umpteen previous statements.
this not-at-all-minor point most does effectively two things grows in less cagey american minds the palpability and thus legitimacy of a russian threat, and renews cold war propaganda pitting two global superpowers as mortal enemies  ostensibly setting up a pre-justification to act in even pre-emptive self-defense anywhere on the planet this proxy war plays out.
additionally, in a matter of weeks, disfavor over u.s. actions has cemented military and other alliances between a quickly mounting number of former, longstanding american allies and other traditional western foes  the vast majority of which align with russia.
after a subtly significant geopolitical snub during a meeting of the u.n. security council to negotiate a ceasefire in syria, which infuriated saudi arabia, egypt fomented a friendly military relationship with unsc presiding body, russia.
for the first time, beginning october 15, reuters reported, joint drills between egyptian and russian paratrooper units began in egypt, and will continue through the 26th. further, the growing rift with saudi arabia indicated egypt might have been weighing options for a different ally for some time. reuters wrote
a halt to shipments of saudi fuel to egypt under a 23 billion aid deal shows that a rift between the arab worlds richest country and its most populous may be deeper than previously thought, which could leave egypt desperate for a new sponsor.
egypt hasnt been alone in jumping ship  and the middle east isnt the sole locus of conflict.
during a four-day visit at the invitation of chinese president xi jinping this week  amid deteriorating relations with the united states  philippine president rodrigo duterte asserted it is only china that can help us.
this massive shift in alignment could have highly consequent repercussions in the territorial dispute over the south china sea  another conflict in which the u.s. has embroiled itself in several proxy wars, including russian-backed china.
in fact, although the philippines had been at the center of that quarrel, unnamed chinese officials prior to the ongoing meeting announced china would consider giving filipino fishermen conditional access to disputed waters in the south china sea after the presidents of the two countries meet in beijing this week.
now, following through on intimations the philippines would cleave from the west, duterte just made a historic and stunning announcement today, to an auditorium in beijing packed with over 200 chinese and philippine business people, including chinese vice premier zhang gaoli
in this venue, your honours, in this venue, i announce my separation from the united states. both in military, not maybe social, but economics also. america has lost.
he added, ive realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe i will also go to russia to talk to president vladimir putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world  china, philippines and russia. its the only way.
as another geostrategic and commercial waterway of international importance, the south china seas role in the u.s. proxy war is second only to the red sea and access to it  but the presence of american naval vessels in both those waters and neighboring east china sea has been deemed an aggressive threat by china and its strengthening ally russia, as well as north korea.
joint naval and military drills conducted by the u.s. and ally south korea and the planned installation of the u.s. terminal high altitude area defense, or thaad, missile system along the latters borders inflamed tensions with north korea  who has been testing ballistic missiles for months, much to the consternation of the two nations and ally, japan.
on wednesday, in response to this perceived aggression, north korea issued a severe admonishment to the two countries that even minor signs of aggression would greenlight pyongyang to flatten seoul in a defensive first-strike nuclear attack.
it has been too long a time since our revolutionary armed forces switched to a principle of pre-emptive strike in the conduct of war, in response to the aggressive war provocations of our enemies,pyongyang stated, as cited by upi, ominously adding a ruthless pre-emptive strike is to be applied even in the face of minor signs of aggression.
not known for backing down from delicate situations, u.s. secretary of state john kerry declared its intent to deploy thaad as soon as possible, after meeting with south korean officials in washington, and told the press
let me be clear. any attack on the united states or its allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an effective and overwhelming response. we do not, and we will not, accept north korea as a nuclear-armed state.
leaving nothing open to misinterpretation, u.s. secretary of defense ashton carter clarified in a separate press statement that, in defense of seoul, the united states guaranteed full spectrum use of its response capabilities  meaning nuclear missiles are anything but off the table.
shortly afterward, according to nbc news, u.s. strategic command said it had detected what it believed to be a failed missile launch near the northwestern north korean city of kusong. director of the north korean foreign ministrys institute for american studies, lee yong pil, told nbc news pyongyang will absolutely strike first if pyongyang perceives it necessary, saying,
the u.s. has nuclear weapons off our coast, targeting our country, our capital and our dear leader, kim jong un. we will not step back as long as theres a nuclear threat to us from the united states. south korean foreign minister yun byung-se, saying its allies would employ all tools in the toolkit for defense, asserted,
what is most important is to continuously demonstrate our capability and deterrence with our commitment and actions so that pyongyang can feel the panic under their skins. north korea might be known for blustery rhetoric it refuses to back with significant action  but continued provocation by the united states might elicit a response far more detrimental than words.",199,736267,fake

"as millions face obamacare hikes, plan's architect smiles for the camera ezekiel emanuel laughed on wednesday as the hosts of msnbcs morning joe joked about his brainchild, obamacare, which on tuesday emanuel noted was going to cause severe fiscal pain for at least a million americans.
on wednesdays show, mika brzezinski noted that emanuel, a former adviser to president barack obama is often called one of the architects of the affordable care act.
hows that working for you right now, zeke? chimed in host joe scarborough.
 
related stories bill clinton leads crowd in litany of obamacares failures scarborough everything republicans predicted about obamacare is coming true new data shows double-digit rate hikes for obamacare emanuel grinned while on remote from philadelphia.
be honest, though, scarborough continued. zeke only worked on the part of the affordable care act thats causing increases 25 percent on average.
emanuel was once again all smiles.
 
a day before, there were not many smiles when emanual appeared on cnn and told jake tapper the extent of obamacares fiscal effects.
theres a million people for whom this is going to be severe or uncomfortable, he said.
earlier this week, the obama administration announced that the average premium costs will rise 25 percent next year. however, some states were far higher. a popular  silver healthcare plan is scheduled to increase 116 percent in arizona; 40 percent in north carolina; and 53 percent in pennsylvania.
emanuel said the problem of rising premiums some americans will have trouble affording is just part of the way obamacare evolved.

these price increases that were seeing this year are a one-time increase relative to the fact that insurance companies didnt know who was going to come in, under-priced their premiums in the first few years, and are readjusting them based on whos in the marketplace, said emanuel, suggesting that tweaking the system will fix the problem.
  its what any company would do if they launch a product, some problems arise, and you try to fix them, he said.

"19 men cry rape by iran's top quran reader print saeed toosi, right, and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal, the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping 19 of his students and charged with advocating corruption. 
saeed toosi, 46, winner of the first prize for reading the quran, both internationally and locally, fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi, reported al arabiya. 
in an audio recording, toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and, together with the head of irans judicial authority, had agreed to a cover-up to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime. 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts. the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a much-needed dose of truth about the religion of peace. 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake. one of the victims  a recent first-place winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was 12 while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition. the mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. 
all victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions. 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei, current supreme leader of iran. he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan. last may, toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council, with many of irans top officials in attendance. 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man. 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality, sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture, causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced. the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic. 
according to the reformist amad news, officials held a two-hour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast. the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged. 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani, whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents, defended the regimes handling of the case, london guardian reported. larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story, so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not. 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling, though there will be no public trial. awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation. 
toosi, who has denied the charges against him  calling them total lies meant to discredit irans religious institutions and the ayatollah  is reportedly threatening to release the names of 100 of irans top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children, if the prosecution proceeds.",238,736264,real

tuesday evening trump made the case that due to the fbis announcement about clintons emails voters might have buyers remorse , a lot of things have happened over the last few days. this is a message for any democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for hillary clinton and are having a bad case of buyers remorse  in other words you want to change your vote  wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think youve made a mistake. 
while its true that people in some states can change their votes, its not true that this rule was changed because of hillary clintons emails and yes, thats a new right wing thing apparently. trump doesnt suggest the law was changed because of clinton, but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about clinton because of the non-surprise october surprise! the republican fbi director delivered , which was perceived to have benefited the trump ticket. 
days ago, snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the fbis bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to clinton. 
claim after fbi director jim comey announced that he was reviewing e-mails potentially linked to hillary clinton, several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes. mixture 
whats true some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day. 
whats false no states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for hillary clinton to change their votes. 
and to make this even better, that false information was based on a fox news report that wasnt selling the false story about clinton, but still got some of the information wrong. this is why the right cant have nice things. the left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular, because epistemic closure leads to losing. 
trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping, exhaustive list of lawsuits, bragging about sexual assault, dissing minorities and a gold star family, and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaigns ties to russia. 
only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a clinton aides emails when they dont even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet. 
while this race is far from over, if all americans get off their butts and go vote, donald trump faces an uphill battle to the white house.",133,736270,real
"listen clinton crime family exposed by veteran fbi assistant director listen clinton crime family exposed by veteran fbi assistant director posted on october 30, 2016 by shae weatherall in politics share this 
on the heels of the fbi announcing its renewed investigation into hillary clintons emails, veteran fbi assistant director and wiretap expert james kallstrom is speaking out. in his statements, kallstrom exposes the clintons as being a crime family, adding credence to the long list of allegations against them for unethical and illegal activities throughout the last several decades. hillary and bill clinton sharing a secret, former fbi assistant director james kallstrom inset. 
during an interview with radio host john catsimatidis, former fbi assistant director in charge, new york division, james kallstrom, came forward with some serious statements about the clinton family. according to kallstrom, the fbis original investigation into hillary clintons emails was impeded by the department of justice and other top officials in our government. however, now that the case has been reopened, he is apparently seeing it as an opportunity to add his expert opinion and his own insider knowledge of the situation. 
the hill has provided a partial transcript of kallstroms remarks 
 the clintons, thats a crime family, basically , kallstrom said.  its like organized crime. i mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool . 
 the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation , he said.  thats the problem. they never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, im sure, is loretta lynch would not go along with that . 
 the agents are furious with whats going on, i know that for a fact , he said. 
listen as former fbi asst. director kallstrom speaks about why he supports donald trump as president and explains how he knows that hillary clinton would be a devastating choice to lead america. 
among the many statements he made during the full ten-minute interview , perhaps this one was the most profound 
 its just outrageous how hillary clinton sold her office for money. and shes a pathological liar, and shes always been a liar. and god forbid if we put someone like that in the white house.  
given her extensive and tainted legal and political history, it is truly outrageous that hillary clinton was ever allowed to become the democrat nominee for president to begin with. now, shes under a second federal investigation for wrongdoing while she was serving as our secretary of state, and shockingly, there are still those who support her. 
she is obviously corrupt to the core, but hopefully, over the next few days, as more information comes out, people will open their eyes and realize that hillarys campaign for votes is no different than any other self-serving racket she and her family have been involved in.",108,736267,fake
"the fed failed . and that changes everything by jeffrey snider, alhambra investment partners 
there is a growing body of public work that suggests federal reserve officials are prepared now for a very different sort of normalization than what had been envisioned up until this year. that comes, as noted earlier , with the realization that the economy is not just in rough shape but likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future . 
the important caveat left off that bleak pronouncement is actually ceteris paribus . so long as the current policy and monetary system remains firmly in place, there is little hope the global economy will just spontaneously ignite. since economists and central bankers have made it clear they arent going anywhere despite being wrong about everything up to now, here we are. 
even janet yellen has been forced to concede that even if the fed does manage to get on with further rate hikes, the ultimate destination for them in nominal terms is much less than prior cycles. current thinking seems to be aiming for around 3 for the federal funds rate rather than 5 as had long been accepted. the way things are going, and as the japanese showed , they will be lucky to get even half that far. 
but in what can be only another sign of just how twisted, upside down, and easily receptive to pretzel logic the mainstream is now, that is supposed to be a good thing especially for stocks. writing today for bloombergview , mohamed el-erian, chief economic advisor for allianz, makes this exact argument . 
equity investors have also been reassured by the growing  and correct  recognition that this fed hiking cycle will depart drastically from historical norms. instead of following a relatively linear path of increases at regular intervals, it will have pronounced stop-go characteristics. also, and perhaps more importantly, the endpoint  or what economists call the neutral rate  will be considerably lower than recent historical averages. 
how in the world is that a good thing that would reassure equity investors ? truly rational investors make decisions based on discounted information about the future, and what el-erian suggests here and he hasnt been alone is that stock investors show more preference for accommodative monetary policy than actual growth. a lower rate ceiling implies without much ambiguity continued awful economic conditions here and elsewhere around the world. but to the screwed up nature of mainstream thought, so long as monetary policy is lower overall continued stagnation is forgiven, perhaps even to be mildly celebrated? 
what does it mean by claiming accommodation that gives investors so much apparent comfort? it cant mean that in economic terms for obvious reasons; instead we are led to believe that low meaning desperately insufficient growth isnt all that bad so long as interest rates dont rise too far. investors are supposed to be paying for growth , not the failure of interest rate stimulus to seed it. if the fed feels it cant raise rates all that much, with a true ceiling yet to be determined, it is a much riskier , not less risky, environment. 
the idea of a lower r or r-star is truly a defining defeat, though it is, like el-erians attempt here, being spun into what is nothing more than rationalization . as i wrote in september , the falling r-star can mean nothing else 
there is more complexity when we talk about inflation, of course, but by and large it is commodity prices that have thwarted john williams or janet yellens normalizing narrative. commodities have been falling more intensely since the middle of 2014 but really dating back to the middle of 2011. both of those inflections recall and are related to obvious eurodollar or global wholesale money events. thus, even subscribing to wicksells theory, the current rate must now be, as it has been, above the natural rate, unambiguously indicating tight money. whether it is via friedmans interest rate fallacy or wicksells natural rate hypothesis, both arrive at the same conclusion due to seemingly intractable market prices. 
central banks assume that means they have to stimulate more when in fact it is just their math telling them they havent stimulated at all  at least not where it counts and has been needed. translating depression into econometrics is a long and costly affair, but it is at least starting to be done, slowly and in discrete pieces. r may yet be of some great value, insofar as further calculating just how little monetary authorities know about money. 
reception of and belief about qe have been very much cult-like and it was thus too thinly constructed to withstand being so thoroughly debunked. this is not even close to making the best of a bad situation; it is instead claiming positive attributes that just dont exist, being downright offensive to common sense. how anyone, let alone el-erian, wrote that paragraph contained within an article further rationalizing the latest of the rising dollar without awareness of its very basic flaw can at best be described as intentionally obtuse while still bordering upon nakedly deceiving. the world of the near future is going to be bad, worse than everything we have been expecting, but take heart, the feds monetary policy will reflect just that . translating it from the original mainstream thought-bubble language truly reveals its truly absurd premise the fed failed, and that changes everything; including and especially what is to be made of accommodation and what it is that might have reassured equity investors in the past and might do so or not going forward.",230,736266,fake

"pakistan recalls diplomats from india, threatens to expel indian envoys accuses indian diplomats of espionage amid growing tensions   
on-again, off-again fighting between indian and pakistani forces in kashmir looks to be spilling over into the diplomatic relationship between the two nations, as pakistan has announced it will withdraw six staffers from their mission in new dehli, and threaten to expel a number of indian diplomats. 
the six staffers withdrawn include at least four diplomats, and pakistani officials went on to accuse the five indian diplomats of espionage , naming them in media reports and threatening to expel them from the country outright. 
this is a continuation of tit-for-tat expulsions which began last week, with both nations ordering a staffer out of the others embassy on espionage charges. the tensions are soaring with reports of heavy exchanges of fire in kashmir over the weekend. 
india and pakistan are never on the best of terms, but seem to get into these dust-ups once in awhile, usually around the line of control in kashmir. the most recent fighting has been ongoing since august, and seems only to be getting worse as time goes on, raising concerns about a full-scale war between the two nuclear powers.",17,736271,fake

president bushs birthday was july 6, and lauras is on november 4. 
some of the attendees included former commerce secretary donald evans, dallas cowboys owner and general manager jerry jones, and ross perot jr., the son of h. ross perot. george strait performed, and sang happy birthday, per people. typical of bushs down-home style, he wore jeans, a western-style shirt and a prominent belt buckle.

"how the elites are using divide and rule to control us it wasnt long ago that the left represented the anti-establishment wing in politics. they used to fight against globalism remember the anti-globalization movement? even if their motives were different from those of todays anti-globalists, as well as being against censorship, imperialist wars, and the expanding powers of governments and corporations. but today, you see leftists protesting against brexit, attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee, and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians. so, just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites?

to understand, we must go back to 2011 when the occupy movement was ongoing. the occupy protests, which now seem like ages ago, came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system. we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them, but the important fact is that, to the elites, it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power.
the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in post-war history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule. so, the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a full-blown revolution. and they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule.
the diversion 
when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed, the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere. the people want to vent out their frustrations. the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up, so instead of fighting it, they prefer to re-channel that pent up energy elsewhere.
on february 2012, with the occupy movement still raging, the elites were given that golden opportunityor, rather, they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in florida the none other than the infamous trayvon martin case. the shooter wasnt even a full white, but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it; anything to divert the public attention away from them. with their efforts, it quickly became the biggest story of america.
but they didnt stop there. police shootings, which have always been happening and to all races, were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movementa movement that is financed by george soros and others to stir up unrests across america.
did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies?
the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the 1 who were dictating their lives. the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere. although i dont have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement, i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order.
the strategy 
back in 19th century, karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism. if we were to apply this concept to the world today, the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites.
the goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power. meanwhile, they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans. the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one, so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible.
my understanding of their modus operandi is this 1 use hot-button issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage, race issues, and all other politically correct nonsense. 2 have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right. 3 let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats. 4 when the issue fades away, foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process. by cycling through them over and over again, the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them.
thus, we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites, women against men, islam and atheism against christianity, left against right, and so on, but no more anti-globalization, tea party movement, or occupy wall street.
as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists, sexists, and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate, socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government, nothing will change. as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant, and getting in the way of creating a decent society, the people will remain divided. as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals, the latest misogynist outrage, or how a lion named cecil got shot, the elites will continue to win.
a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army, but theres nothing to be alarmed about. theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists.
first, while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites, lets not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either. remember how neo-cons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism? the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmds and saddamal-queda link. while the right has changed a lot since then, there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with russia because usa! usa! usa! .
second, it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule, it is not the end of it. the elites have far more sinister aims. by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism, the elites are preparing for a total social control. i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control.
no matter their differences, when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder, theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security. europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens . a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police . while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism, it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future.
the culture wars necessary fight or engineered distraction? 
the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways, but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites.
on one hand, we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists, zionists , bankers, mega-corporations , and the governments from undermining our existence. really, do the issues of politically-incorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middle-class is being destroyed, revelations of massive corruption in the dnc, the coming police-state, and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world? all the drama of outrage and counter-outrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape.
on the other hand, culture does matter in many ways. uncontrolled immigration, anti-male laws, and censorship are all very relevant issues. and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment, the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model i described above. in a way, we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites.
so, does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us? or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their sjw drones? i dont have a good answer, but whatever we choose to do, i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on. we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind.
conclusion is there still hope? 
although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization, the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment. to me, that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class.
with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps, the only anti-establishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump. this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters.
i have my doubts about trump , but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected. but besides voting, i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us. we cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us; we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny.

"weiner sexting of 15-year-old girl leads to new fbi investigation of hillary emails weiner sexting of 15-year-old girl leads to new fbi investigation of hillary emails   
the giant flaming garbage dump that is clintonworld is offering up a wonderful new development sure to excite anyone who wanted to combine the weiner scandal and the hillary email scandal. 
yes virginia, you can now have both of them in one. like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one, they've been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic. 
the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails  apparently during the probe of former rep. anthony weiners sexting  in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election. 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. 
comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case. 
an fbi source, though, confirmed to fox news that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced rep. weiner and his wife huma abedin, a top clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. the new york times first reported on the weiner investigation connection, noting the fbi had been probing texts weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl. 
as donald trump and congressional republicans seized on the fbis decision, interim democratic party leader donna brazile simply tweeted, good grief, after the news of the anthony weiner connection broke. 
can't argue with her there. 
it would be hilarious if anthony weiner and thereby huma abedin led to the downfall of hillary's lifelong ambition. you just know someone is going to ""commit suicide"" in a d.c. park. 
but does anyone in the democratic party really look forward to 4 to 8 years of this? this is how big of a mess hillary is now. we've reached the point where her ongoing email scandal is now intertwined with a sexting investigation of a 15-year-old girl. and that's just during the election.",72,736266,fake

targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. given weiners well-known penchant for lying, its hard to believe that a prosecutor would give weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. but cooperation can take many forms  and, as wallace indicated on this mornings show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. well see if weiners cooperation extends beyond that. more related",0,736267,real

"comment on multiple ny police departments under investigation for hosting gay sex parties with underage boys by john smith multiple ny police departments under investigation for hosting gay sex parties with underage boys multiple ny police departments under investigation for hosting gay sex parties with underage boys matt agorist november 3, 2016 1 comment 
schenectady, ny  a police officers suspension over an investigation into writing fraudulent checks has prompted a multi-agency investigation into alleged gay sex parties for police officers. while sex parties alone are not criminal, a source close to the investigation said the parties were attended by young boys who were not of legal age to drink or consent to having sex with adults. 
sgt. jonathan e. moore, 35, of the schenectady police department, has been suspended after he and his boyfriend, anthony aubin, 27, were caught at trying to use a fraudulent check to purchase a 92,000 jaguar. aubin was arrested on felony charges for attempting to use the check. 
however, according to a report in the times union, the arrest of aubin, who has a lengthy criminal record and was recently on parole, has triggered a much broader, multi-agency police investigation into allegations that gay officers may have hosted or taken part in sex parties  called breeding parties  that allegedly were attended by teenagers who were not of legal age to drink alcohol or consent to having sex with adults. 
aside from the schenectady police department investigation, the probe has spread to the albany police department as well. as the times reports, other departments may also become involved in the broader investigation, according to a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. 
im not really in a position to say anything about it at this point, albany police chief brendan cox said tuesday. there is a case we are looking into but we are not in a position to even gauge whether or not there is any truth to what has been alleged. 
moore also admitted to using the state-run criminal database for personal reasons to check the background of his boyfriend. 
according to the report, moore told police that he knew aubin had a lengthy criminal record but had no idea the checks were fakes. the 92,000 check was purported to be from a miami law office and the 15,000 check was from a fictitious company on washington avenue in albany, reported the times. 
moore told investigators that aubin moved in with him several months ago and the couple was planning to make a lot of money because they had signed contracts with a connecticut company called bear films to make gay porn movies. 
in a statement on wednesday, schenectady police chief eric clifford said moores involvement in the pornography industry may have violated departmental policies, but he did not mention whether or not the officer will face charges. 
clifford said its not appropriate to have him out on the street working for us. 
after aubin was locked up, he apparently began rolling over on all his other connections in police departments. his allegations have sparked investigations into other officers who may have had unlawful sex with teenage boys. 
police officers having sex with underage victims is, unfortunately, a fairly common practice. police sexual misconduct is so common that more than 1,000 officers have had their licenses revoked in just the last six years for it  nearly half of them involve underage victims. 
according to the report , around 1,000 policemen across the us had their licenses revoked and lost their jobs over the last six years on account of numerous sexual offenses that included rape and possession of child pornography. 
the probe involved examining records from 41 states to see how many police officers licenses were revoked in 2009-2014 and for which offenses. police desertification data was not provided by nine states and the district of columbia. the investigation included examining the records of state and local police, sheriffs deputies, prison guards and school resource officers. however, no federal officers were included in the investigation, meaning that number is likely higher. matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa. this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state. agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world. follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share",184,736271,fake

"us 800-900 isis probably killed in mosul fighting forces still several kilometers from mosul by jason ditz, october 27, 2016 share this 
adding to the upbeat official assessment of the invasion of mosul, centcom chief gen. joseph votel today told the press that he believes the forces involved have  probably killed about 800-900 isis fighters  in the past week and a half. 
by contrast, votel insisted that only 57 iraqi troops were killed, and another 30 kurdish peshmerga. unmentioned was a us soldier also killed in the fighting, embedded with the peshmerga and killed by a roadside bomb north of mosul. 
it is difficult to get accurate information on isis casualties, and the official figures from iraqi officials are almost always dramatically overstated in an effort to sell the war as a runaway success. there are reasons to be skeptical about the 800-900 figure, however. 
the main reason is that iraqi and kurdish forces are still several kilomters away from the outskirts of mosul, mostly occupying empty villages, and while isis has sent out some forces of skirmishers to slow their advance, it is believed the vast majority of their defensive forces have remained in mosul, gearing up for the eventual attack and setting assorted traps. last 5 posts by jason ditz",17,736265,fake

"economist jack rasmus eurozone benefits the strongest economies at the expense of the weakest videos economist jack rasmus eurozone benefits the strongest economies at the expense of the weakest greece has tied its tail to the eurozone, dominated by germany, and it can never get out of this situation as long as germany dominates the institutions, which it does, because the whole arrangement is great for germany, the writer and economist tells mintpress news.  october 31, 2016 be sociable, share! bystanders wait to be handed bags of oranges during a free distribution of fruit and vegetables as a protest by farmers and vendors over proposed pension reforms, in athens on wednesday, jan. 27, 2016. greeces leftwing government is facing an escalating wave of protests over its proposed pension overhaul that has been demanded by bailout creditors. ap photopetros giannakouris 
athens  this has been another eventful year in greece. almost one year after it turned its back on the july 2015 referendum result which rejected further austerity, the syriza-led government has pushed forward a program of even harsher austerity, spending cuts, and privatizations . 
following the british vote to proceed with brexit, or a departure from the european union, fears that greece might follow suit led greeces lenders to demand even more austerity measures from a country already mired in an economic depression. 
in this interview, dr. jack rasmus , a professor of economics and politics at st. marys college of california, analyzes these issues and the many challenges facing the greek and european economies today. 
the author of such books as  looting greece  and  systemic fragility in the global economy , dr. rasmus shares his insights into the consequences of austerity for greece and other peripheral european economies, and presents his proposed solutions for an end to the crisis and austerity. 
mintpress news mpn in september, greek prime minister alexis tsipras gave his annual state of the nation address, where he boasted that the greek economy has turned the corner, that unemployment is going down, that salaries will be increased, and that the country is returning to growth. is this what greeces economic indicators actually show? protesters march to the greek parliament in athens on tuesday nov. 6, 2012. greeces unions are holding their third general strike in six weeks to press dissenters in the countrys troubled coalition government not to back a major new austerity program that will doom greeks to further hardship in a sixth year of recession. two days of demonstrations are planned to start tuesday, continuing until lawmakers vote late wednesday on the bill to slash euro13.5 billion 17.3 billion from budget spending over two years. ap photodimitri messinis 
dr. jack rasmus jr no, not quite. greeces debt is still the same as it was in 2011, roughly 180 percent of gdp. unemployment has come down by only 3 to 4 percent, so instead of 27 percent, its about 23 to 24 percent. thats depression-level unemployment. all the other indicators in the economy are flat or declining, so i dont see anywhere that greece is really recovering, and neither, really, is the entire eurozone economy. its been bouncing along the bottom. 
as i said in my book systemic fragility, its a case of chronic stagnation. the eurozone might grow a little, 0.5 percent or 1 percent above gdp, mostly as a result of germanys growth, then it flattens out or goes below. most of the periphery economies in europe are stagnant or in a recession, as they have been for quite some time. 
as far as raising wages, greece cannot raise, at least in the public sector, any wages without the approval of the troika greeces three major lenders the european commission, european central bank, and the international monetary fund. its a real stretch to say that greece is recovering. its kind of moving sideways, in the condition of still chronic economic depression. 
mpn one of the perceptions that has been prevalent in global public opinion with regard to the economic crisis in greece is that the country has been bailed out with billions upon billions of euros in free money. is this really the case, and where has the so-called bailout money to greece actually gone? 
jr countries dont get bailed out. governments, banks, businesses, and sometimes, though not so frequently, households get bailed out. so the question is, who got bailed out here, in the debt restructuring deals of 2010, 2012, 2015, and this past spring? the banks got bailed out several times. foreign investors and speculators in greek bonds and other securities clearly got bailed out in 2012. if you look at where the money has gone, theres 400 billion in debt in greece still, that they have to pay off, with an economy that is less than half that size, so its impossible. 
where has all this money gone? recent studies by the european school of management and technology documenting the 2010 and 2012 bailouts indicate that 95 percent of all the loans to bail out the greek government, which then bailed out the greek banks  95 percent of that went back to northern europe, mostly to the german and northern european banks that had loaned so much money to greece. bailout funds also went to the troika, particularly the european commission, that then distributed it to the banking system and investors in turn. the ec is the big player here, and to some extent the european central bank, and to a minor extent now the international monetary fund. so, 95 percent of all the money loaned to greece went right back to europe and less than 5 percent of that went back into the greek economy. greece has been subsidizing the financial system elsewhere in europe. a supporter of the communist-affiliated union pame takes part in an anti-austerity rally in front of the parliament in athens, monday, oct. 17, 2016. 
mpn what do you believe needs to be done about the greek debt? 
jr you might ask what needs to be done about debt throughout the eurozone, because its not just greece. greece is perhaps the most serious case, but other places in the periphery of europe are still heavily indebted. you cannot sustain, with austerity measures designed to pay the interest and principal on debt, a 400-plus billion debt based on an economy thats less than 200 billion. even the imf has come to that conclusion and is maneuvering with the other troika members on that particular point. 
is the debt legitimate? well, you have to understand the origins of this debt. it was originally private sector debt that was created as a result of the formation of the eurozone in 1999, the ecb as part of that creation, and other elements of the eurozone agreements, particularly the lisbon strategy that germany adopted. germany and other northern european businesses and bankers pumped money and capital into the periphery, including greece, from 2005 onward. germany had a strong competitive advantage in exports, so a lot of the money and capital was pumped into the periphery, including greece, in order to purchase german and other exports. so the money went in and circulated around, leaving a pile of private sector debt in greece, italy, and other places. 
then we had the crash of 2008-2009 and the debt could not be repaid, and the troika stepped in to offer the governments of greece and other countries money in order to continue to bail out the private sector and enable the repayment of the private debt. so it starts out as private debt, because of this great imbalance in exports within the eurozone, and then that gets converted to government debt, and then the big crash of 2008-2009 adds even more debt, and then you have the recession of 2011-2013 in the eurozone and the 2012 bailout, which piled on more debt in order to pay the old debt, and then in 2015 the same thing. so the troikas piling more debt on greece in order for greece to pay the previous debt, and thats totally unsustainable. theyre going to have to expunge some of that debt. 
of course, the germans, wolfgang schauble the german finance minister and the coalition in the north, does not want to allow that. and they dont really want to change the eurozone, because the eurozone, while very imbalanced for the periphery, has benefited germany significantly. the germans dominate the finance ministers council in the ec and they dominate the ecb, and theyre just keeping the situation the way it is because its profitable for them. demonstrators hold a poster against the austerity policy of germany prior to a special session of the parliament bundestag on negotiations with greece for a new bailout in berlin, germany, friday, july 17, 2015. ap photomarkus schreiber 
mpn why must greek banks be nationalized, in your view? 
jr look at the debt negotiations of 2010, 2012, and 2015. what happened was the ecb, which pretty much controls the greek central bank  the ecb is just a council of central banks dominated by the bundesbank the german central bank and its allies, so they have control  and what you saw in the negotiations is that in 2015, the ecb put the screws to the greek economy, and syriza collapsed and agreed each time the screws were tightened, bringing the economy to a halt. they couldnt deal with the squeeze on the economy by the ecb. this brought the economy to a halt, squeezing it and of course not releasing loans that the troika had agreed to provide greece under previous agreements. there was an economic squeeze that syriza did not have a strategy to deal with, and eventually it capitulated. 
youve got to nationalize, make the greek central bank and the banking systems independent of the ecb. gain control over your economy once again, and that is one of several key steps to prevent the squeeze every time you attempt to renegotiate the debt or restructure the debt. without an independent, greek, people-controlled banking system, the eurozone and the troika will squeeze and bring greece to its knees every time. weve seen that three times. youve got to nationalize the banking system, including the central bank, or if you want to just leave the central bank as part of the ecb structure, go ahead, but create an independent central bank authority elsewhere in the greek government. 
in the u.s. during the great depression, the u.s. central bank had screwed up badly, and president franklin delano roosevelt took over and had his treasury department take over and run the economy. greece would have to set up a parallel central bank in its finance sector, and isolate and bypass the influence of the ecb through the greek central bank. you would have to create a parallel currency as part of this and impose serious controls on bank withdrawals and capital flows outside the country, which syriza did not really do, because the ecb and the troika opposed it. when you have all the capital, bank withdrawals and capital flight is another way of squeezing the country economically. file  in this sunday, oct. 18, 2015 file photo, a man walks past street art depicting greek prime minister alexis tsipras and german chancellor angela merkel in athens, greece. tsipras decision to sign off on a bailout led to many in his left-wing syriza party to quit in protest. 
mpn the current government in greece has been continuing a policy of massive privatizations of greek public assets, with profitable airports and harbors having been privatized in the past year, in addition to the recent selloff of the greek national railroad for a total of 45 million 49 million. what are the short- and long-term impacts of the privatization of such public assets? 
jr the short-term is that when you privatize them, under the aegis of the troika, if you sell below market prices, which a lot of these assets are being sold at, thats profit on the sale for the investors who are buying up these assets. but once the assets are in private hands, where does the revenue go? does it go back into greece or does it go back into the pockets of the investors and the corporations and the banks outside greece that are buying it up? well, it goes out. its a form of capital flight. money that is needed in greece flows out of greece. 
this is a new form of financial imperialism, wealth extraction in other words, that is being structured and managed on a state-to-state basis. its not 19th century british imperialism where they set up a factory in india, paid them low wages, and brought the textiles back to london to re-sell at a higher price. its not that kind of production imperialism. this is financial imperialism imposed on greece, and its a new form thats emerging everywhere, where you indebt the country and then you force the country to engage in austerity in order to pay the principal and interest on the debt, and you extract the income from the country. privatizations are another form of that. 
you privatize public goods, you get them at fire-sale prices, and then the income flows from those assets flow back to the coffers of the private companies or the banks, outside of greece. 
the other consequence is when you privatize, they come in and they cut costs, which means they lay off people in mass numbers, they put a hold on wages, they get rid of benefits, and they do everything else to maximize their revenue. 
finally, longer term, it means that greece has less control over its own economy if it cant control its infrastructure and everything is owned by foreigners. then you cant influence it as much, and if youre part of the eurozone, youre legally prohibited from what you can do to make sure that these foreign-owned infrastructure companies are behaving in terms of the benefit for the public sector, for the rest of greece. 
mpn you have argued in your book, systemic fragility in the global economy, that there are nine major trends which account for the economic troubles that are seen on a global scale. what are some of these trends? 
jr everywhere, and particularly since 2008, we see central banks and monetary policy to be ascendant, and that means creating money, pumping it into the economy to bail out the financial systems, the financial institutions, the banks and the shadow banks, meaning speculators, hedge funds, private equity firms, asset management companies, and so forth. weve seen bailouts of tens of trillions of dollars since 2008. all of that liquidity injection into the economy has driven interest rates down to zero or even, in europe and japan and elsewhere, negative rates, and that fuels debt. with rates that cheap, corporations and businesses float new corporate bonds, and they use the money not to invest necessarily, they use it to buy back the stock and drive up the stock prices and pay out dividends, or they sit on it, they hoard it, or they send it to emerging markets. thats a problem everywhere, and thats the result of massive liquidity injections, which have really been escalating since the 1980s, when controls on international capital flows were eliminated everywhere. 
after the 1970s, when the bretton woods system collapsed and central banks took over, the combination of those has led to the financialization of the global economy in the 21st century, where profits are far greater for investing and speculating in financial securities than they are in investing in real assets and real things that create real jobs and real income and real consumption. were becoming dependent on debt more and more. the economy is increasingly credit- and debt-driven, and thats the result of this massive liquidity injection, and it also leads to a shift from real asset investment  investing in real things that create jobs that people need  toward financial asset investment. that means that real investment collapses over time and productivity collapses over time as well, and we see that happening everywhere. 
thats a major point that i argued about in my book, systemic fragility, this financialization of the global economy based on liquidity and debt and squeezing out. its diverting money and capital from real investment into financial speculation. whats going on in greece is a concrete expression of this, the reliance on financial means and financial manipulation. the periphery in the eurozone is at a great disadvantage to germany and others, and theyre being manipulated financially. all the payments on interest and the debt flow back to the north. this is all flowing through the ec to the private sector, and its a nice constant money capital flow from interest payments and privatization and speculation on government bonds and securities and stocks in these countries as the volatility occurs. 
its a reflection, in greece, of whats happening on a broader scale elsewhere in the global economy, and thats why we havent seen much of a recovery in the global economy. global trade is stagnant and real investment everywhere is drifting toward zero, productivity is negative almost everywhere, even in the u.s., and were seeing growth rates of barely 1 percent, 1.5 percent, at best, when it should be double that. we see these growing, non-performing bank loans, almost 2 trillion in europe, the worst in italy with about 400 billion. we see the same thing in japan and in china. were becoming more systemically fragile financially because of this shift to financial speculation. in this july 5, 2012 file photo president of the european central bank mario draghi speaks during a news conference in frankfurt, central germany. ap photodapd, mario vedder, file 

mintpress what is your outlook for the eurozone economy and the difficulties that it is currently facing? 
jr the european banking system has never fully recovered from the 2008-2009 crash. the ecb is pumping money into the banking system in various ways, long-term refinancing options and all the bailout funds and qualitative easing and negative interest rates and so forth. theyre desperately pumping money into the banking system, but the banks arent really lending, at least to those businesses that would reinvest in real assets to create jobs. its far more profitable to make money now. investors make more money from financial speculation than they do from investing long-term and expecting to get a return over 10 to 20 years for investment in a real company that creates real things. 
we can see the strains now with the non-performing loans, in particular in italy. of course, we know the situation with the non-performing bank loans in greece. portugal is in bad shape as well in terms of non-performing loans, and now we see even institutions like germanys deutsche bank and others beginning to feel this strain, and the further impact on the european banking system of the brexit the departure of great britain from the european union. 
the problem is that the private banks are either hoarding the cash, they wont invest in real growth, or theyre sending their money offshore to emerging markets, or theyre using it, as in the u.s., to buy back stock and pay out dividends and loaning money to companies to do just that. the global economy has changed dramatically in ways that make it much more fragile than ever before. a lot of debt has been building up everywhere over 50 trillion in additional debt has occurred since 2009, and when the next recession comes, how are they going to pay that debt? 
when times are stable or growing, you can add debt without a great crisis emerging, but when you have a recession or a downturn thats significant, where are you going to get the money capital to pay the principal and interest on the debt? then you start seeing defaults and you start seeing financial asset price collapses going on, and now youre back in 2008-2009. thats the picture of the global economy. a farmer tries to protect himself as he clashes with a riot policeman during an anti-government protest at central syntagma square in athens, wednesday, nov. 18, 2015. greek farmers protesting over planned tax and pension reforms demanded by the countrys bailout creditors have clashed outside parliament with police, who used tear gas to disperse them. ap photoyorgos karahalis 
mpn what would be the steps for greece to follow, in your view, in order to escape the spiral of economic depression and austerity? 
jr syriza made it clear, when it came into power, that it was not in favor of grexit a greek departure from the eurozone, and it has always maintained that position. an unprepared, were leaving the eurozone and the euro kind of decision would cause a collapse of values, particularly among those who have investments in some savings in greece. to some extent, syriza was caught between a rock and a hard place here. they couldnt or didnt want to advocate an exit, and at least those who had investments didnt want it because of the potential effect on their investments. the broader greek populace thinks, still, that to be european you have to be in the eurozone. thats a big mistake. 
i think what greece and syriza should have done is to create a parallel currency and to take over its banking system. in other words, make the banking system truly independent, including the greek central bank, and if that was not possible, bypass the greek central bank and set up a central banking function in the finance ministry, as the u.s. has done at different times. create a parallel currency, and policies and programs to get people to convert their euros into the parallel currency. maybe declare that henceforth all taxes to the greek government will be paid with the parallel currency, and that means that people would then trade in their euros for the parallel currency to pay their taxes. 
then tell the troika the ec, the ecb, and the imf  collectively, greeces lenders that were going to pay you in your euros, but if we run out of euros here as a result of the conversion, well, tough luck, we dont have a way of paying you, lets negotiate a final deal where you expunge some of it and we pay you off and we go our separate ways. of course, you would have to create significant capital flow controls, which has always been a problem every time theres been a crisis; the money flows out of greece. take the economy out of the control of the troika without a formal exit. 
that could have been done, but for some reason syriza and its finance advisers either didnt want to do that or didnt know how to do that. 
mpn arguments that have been heard against a parallel currency include the claim that the existence of two currencies would create a situation where there would be haves and have nots  between those who would hold a stronger, hard currency, compared to those holding a weaker, devalued currency. how do you respond to this? 
jr there are policies and approaches you can take that entice and require people to convert their euros into the new currency. that would raise the demand and therefore the value, the price of the new currency. if you just had the currency and you didnt have this forced trade-in, then of course you would have haves and have nots, the new currency would collapse, and pretty soon no one would want to use it. but, for example, saying that taxes could only be paid with the new currency, would force people who had corporations and businesses and so forth to purchase the new currency with the euro. it would undermine the value of the euro in greece and it would raise the value of the new currency in greece as well. that might set off a parallel elsewhere in the eurozone with other countries thinking the same thing, which would undermine the value of the euro and put the squeeze on the troika for once. greece never put the squeeze on the troika, it was just the opposite in all of these negotiations that occurred, they never really hurt the troika in negotiations, and thats the only way you prevail in negotiations. youve got to make it unpleasant for the opposition. syriza never did that, they played along and made concession after concession. 
syriza thought that their example would strike a spark elsewhere in europe of other social democratic forces and governments. they thought that they would get the rest of the social democracies behind them and together they would reform the eurozone. that was a fiction, a fantasy thought on the part of alexis tsipras and others, but that was the core of their whole strategy. european social democracy is a dying force, and thats why you see the growth on the fringes, both to the right and the left. 
tsipras and former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis problem was that they thought they could get all these elements behind them and that together they would have enough weight to force schauble and other finance ministers to make concessions. well, schauble and the other ministers, the german faction, as i call it, within the finance ministers council in the ec, remained dominant. at every step along the way, whenever syriza and its few allies tried to make a compromise where some concessions were made to them, the german faction squelched it. we saw that, for example, at the very end, when greece held the referendum in july 2015. greece held the vote, and the vote said go back and negotiate a better deal for us, and what did tsipras do? he totally caved in to the schauble faction, and then the schauble faction said, the offer we made last week is now off the table, youre going to have to accept an even worse one. so they put the screws to syriza, and syriza looked to its allies in the ec, and they totally caved in as well. things just got worse and worse until you had the final austerity agreement on august 20, 2015. 
it was a step-by-step retreat from syrizas election in january 2015, because syriza had the wrong strategy and was not engaged in certain necessary tactics. of course, the troika itself had a lot of cards to play. it would have been an uphill fight for syriza. the time where they might have been able to strike some concessions from the troika was 2012, but new democracy the center-right party in power at the time in greece was totally in the pocket of the troika, so that was impossible. 
this past spring, the imf and the troika were worried about brexit and what impact that might have on renewing grexit. so they put the screws to greece again, raised the debt even more, austerity even more, and i think another round of that is coming, because the imf wants out of the troika deal. well see what happens at the imf meeting, but they havent endorsed even the 2015 agreement because they know its unsustainable. i think the imf is maneuvering to have the ec to buy its portion of the debt, and once that happens, the ec will demand even more austerity from greece. president of france francois hollande, u.s. president barack obama, britains prime minister david cameron and germanys chancellor angela merkel attend the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip meeting at the g20 the g-20 leaders summit in brisbane, australia, sunday, nov. 16, 2014. 
mpn in the event that a parallel currency is implemented and steps are taken to maintain or strengthen its value, could that be a prelude to a switch to a national, domestic currency? 
jr yes. at some point, one currency will become dominant. you cant have two equal currencies like that. another advantage of the new currency is that it will start out at less value than the euro, and that will be used as the trading currency. that will stimulate greek exports to elsewhere, outside the eurozone. 
part of the problem is that the periphery in europe is so dependent on exports and imports to germany and the north, that it cant really engage in its own independent export strategy without cutting wages. throughout europe, you have whats called internal devaluation, when you are stuck with a currency and someone elses central bank, the ecb and the euro. you cant really engage in independent monetary policy to stimulate your economy and you cant engage in lowering your currency in order to gain some advantage in exports. youre stuck, and only the most powerful country thats most efficient and has the lowest costs is able to take advantage of global exports, and thats germany. the weaker economies of the periphery will always be at a disadvantage to germany when it comes to trying to push their exports anywhere else outside the eurozone. 
thats the lesson. the lesson is that youve got a 1999 agreement in which you have this quasi-central bank, the ecb, and you have the euro, and that arrangement significantly benefits the most efficient, low-cost producer, which is germany, at the expense of the periphery. until you have a true central bank and fiscal union to some extent, that will pump the money into the periphery to help it grow when it doesnt, you will always have the situation you have in europe right now. 
compare that to the u.s., where theres a fiscal union, so that if certain states have economic problems  the federal government can pump money into those specific locations. if you dont have a true federal government and fiscal union, you cant do that, and if your central bank is dominated by the largest economy  germany  even the monetary policy has no effect. and if its a single currency, its to the advantage of the stronger economy at the disadvantage of the weaker. 
the eurozone economy is structured to emphasize the growth of the strongest economies at the expense of the weaker, and thats not going to change. its built into the eurozone. you cannot create a currency union and a customs union without a true banking union and fiscal union. more and more countries in the eurozone are beginning to come to that conclusion, but it was foreordained. economists knew this from the beginning, and thats the tragedy. greece has tied its tail to the eurozone, dominated by germany, and it can never get out of this situation as long as germany dominates the institutions, which it does, because the whole arrangement is great for germany. a protesters carries a protest sign during a rally prior to the opening of the new european central bank ecb headquarter in frankfurt, germany, wednesday, march 18, 2015. at least four police cars were set alight and two officers injured wednesday as authorities confronted violent anti-austerity protesters ahead of the inauguration ceremony for the european central banks new headquarters ap photodpa, arne dedert 

mpn tell us about your most recent book, looting greece. 
jr its really a case study of the consequences of financialization and globalization and integration. i argue that there is this phenomenon of the smaller economies being tied into the larger economies through free trade agreements, which lead to currency unions, which lead to banking unions, and then youve got a situation like greece and the euro periphery and the problems associated with that. 
the book also takes a historical look at the origins of the greek debt, that starts in 1999 with the creation of the eurozone, the adoption of the euro by greece in 2002 and the consequences of that, how the debt developed, first in the private sector because of german export domination and then conversion of the private debt in 2008-2009 to the public debt, and then the collapse of 2008-2009, which added to the government debt. then you had the 2012 agreement where the private sector was bailed out, and that added more debt, and then 2015 and so forth. all this is described in detail in the early chapters, and then most of the book is a step-by-step look at the negotiations between syriza and the troika, from syrizas january 2015 election through the spring of 2016, and what were the strategic and tactical errors of syriza and the strategic and tactical moves by the troika which enabled it to prevail. 
at the end, the book discusses how this is a form of a new emerging financial and wealth extraction from smaller economies by the larger economies, because of the globalization and integration arrangement that exists, the emergence of financial extraction and financial exploitation, and how central banks are feeding that all. this will lead to my next book, which is about global central banks and the problems theyve created as we move to another crisis, which i think is coming in the next five years. demonstrators dressed as clowns pass by a burning police car wednesday, march 18, 2015 in frankfurt, germany. blockupy activists try to blockade the new headquarters of the ecb to protest against government austerity and capitalism. ap photomichael probst be sociable, share!",112,736268,fake

breaking news from venezuela  the american puppet henrique capricious capriles along with his friends in the venezuelan congress are attempting to engineer a political coup against president nicolas maduro. after years of attempting to oust the late bolivarian president hugo chavez, the foreign owned opposition continue to harass his successor. the model which the venezuelan insurgents seek to ape is that of brazil which recently used congressional powers to remove the democratically elected president dilma rousseff. 
the move will likely fail, but it does demonstrate two important things. first of all, it shows how the right-wing forces in latin america, so determined to push for us domination of their own countries, will stop at nothing to get their way, up to and including a total disregard for democracy. 
secondly, it demonstrates that under barack obamas incompetent leadership, america can no longer control the destiny of the latin american countries that washington used to reign over like obedient right wing clients. latin america is clearly going its own way from ecuador to venezuela to uruguay. the way latin america is choose is that of the left. 
even brazils putative western puppet, the unelected michel temer hasnt broken off his relations with the brics to which brazil gives its first letter, in spite of many hopes in the west that he would do. from manilla to caracas, america is losing her erstwhile colonial playground. whats more is that whilst the current venezuelan congress has been publically accused of buying votes, the election of president maduro has been approved as democratically fair by all but the most far-right, agenda observers.
