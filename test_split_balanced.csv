"michelle obama poses in a pretty dress, so racist conservatives call her a monkey screenshots on november 12, 2016 354 pm  
trump fans may have won the election, but they arent taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of michelle obama. the donalds deplorables were out in force after the first lady posed for the cover of vogue. 
i could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine, obama told the magazine . i could have focused on flowers. i could have focused on decor. i could have focused on entertainment. because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. theres no legislative authority; youre not elected. and thats a wonderful gift of freedom. 
in exercising her freedom, michelle obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans  and in exercising their freedom, the right has responded with nothing but hate. the reaction to the first lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. readers of yahoo news showered obama with racist remarks, calling her an ape and a monkey and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. 
if you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. trump fans are not done by a long shot  and now they have been emboldened by america electing its first official kkk candidate. 
it will get worse before it gets better.

"illegal immigrant advocates pledge to resist deportation under trump email 
following the surprisingly strong electoral victory of donald trump to the white house in this years presidential election, a spokesperson for a group founded to revive the rejected 2007 dream atct  which would have granted amnesty to minors illegally in the united states  pledged to resist mass deportation of illegal aliens. the spokesperson also called border patrol cbp and immigration and customs enforcement ice personnel ""agents of racism. 
in a statement quoted by the washington times , cristina jimenez, co-founder of united we dream which describes itself as the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the nation said immigrants are declaring a state of urgency and resilience. over the coming weeks, our families and community members will need to tap into the incredible strength that brought us to this country and which we use to survive. 
in her statement, jimenez not only expressed dismay at the election of trump but also castigated the agents of the federal agencies charged with protecting our borders. 
all people with love in our hearts are angered and disappointed tonight and pledge to resist mass deportation, she said. ice and cbp have proven themselves to be agents of racism and agents of hate. 
both the national border patrol council nbpc and the national immigration and customs enforcement ice council  the two unions that represent border patrol and ice agents, respectively, had announced endorsements of trump during the presidential campaign. 
we reported in our article last april that the nbpcs leaders  including brandon judd, the unions president; kenneth palinkas, its past president; shawn moran; the unions vice president; and chris cabrera, a spokesperson for the nbpcs rio grande valley council  have all been vocal in criticizing the obama administrations lack of enforcement of our nations immigration laws. 
the nbpc issued a press release on march 30 that stated part of the reason for its endorsement of trump mr. trump is correct when he says immigration wouldnt be at the forefront of this presidential campaign if months ago he hadnt made some bold and necessary statements. and when the withering media storm ensued he did not back down one iota. that tells you the measure of a man. when the so-called experts said he was too brash and outspoken, and that he would fade away, they were proven wrong. we are confident they will be proven wrong again in november when he becomes president of the united states. 
the union representing the nations immigration and customs enforcement officers and staff, the ice council, endorsed trump last september. their endorsement statement noted donald trump reached out to us for a meeting, sat down with me to discuss his goals for enforcement, and pledged to support ice officers, our nations laws and our members. in his immigration policy, he has outlined core policies needed to restore immigration security including support for increased interior enforcement and border security, an end to sanctuary cities, an end to catch-and-release, mandatory detainers, and the canceling of executive amnesty and non-enforcement directives. 
a notice on the united we dream website stated that when the dream act failed to get 60 votes in the senate in 2007, a group of dreamers, organizers, and advocates came together to reflect on the dream act campaign and talk about building a movement and organization that would not hinge on votes in congress. 
president obama, frustrated that the dream act the development, relief, and education for alien minors act had repeatedly failed to pass, had already decided to bypass congress by creating the daca deferred action for childhood arrivals program to allow youth who had brought into the country illegally by their parents as children immigrants to work legally in the united states. 
critics of daca have pointed out that the program is a means to circumvent congress and grant amnesty to those who reside here illegally. 
the daca program was created in 2012 via policy memo by then-secretary of homeland security janet napolitano. in 2014, homeland security secretary jeh johnson further expanded the daca program by removing its age cap and extending the work authorization to three years. subsequently a group of states challenged this executive action in the case of state of texas, et al v united states, et al. 
the daca program was brought to a halt after u.s. district judge andrew hanen of the u.s. district court for the southern district of texas responded to the plaintiff states by issuing an order of temporary injunction to block the federal government from implementing the obama administrations policy memorandums that expanded daca and implemented the deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents dapa program. 
the obama administration appealed hanens ruing in a case that went all the way to the supreme court. after the court issued a tied 8-8 decision on the appeal, hanens injunction was allowed to stand. 
with the election of donald trump, it is expected that the new president will issue an executive order of his own to reverse those issued by obama administration officials to create daca. it is the anticipation of this move that has groups such as united we dream worried.

"economist jack rasmus eurozone benefits the strongest economies at the expense of the weakest videos economist jack rasmus eurozone benefits the strongest economies at the expense of the weakest greece has tied its tail to the eurozone, dominated by germany, and it can never get out of this situation as long as germany dominates the institutions, which it does, because the whole arrangement is great for germany, the writer and economist tells mintpress news.  october 31, 2016 be sociable, share! bystanders wait to be handed bags of oranges during a free distribution of fruit and vegetables as a protest by farmers and vendors over proposed pension reforms, in athens on wednesday, jan. 27, 2016. greeces leftwing government is facing an escalating wave of protests over its proposed pension overhaul that has been demanded by bailout creditors. ap photopetros giannakouris 
athens  this has been another eventful year in greece. almost one year after it turned its back on the july 2015 referendum result which rejected further austerity, the syriza-led government has pushed forward a program of even harsher austerity, spending cuts, and privatizations . 
following the british vote to proceed with brexit, or a departure from the european union, fears that greece might follow suit led greeces lenders to demand even more austerity measures from a country already mired in an economic depression. 
in this interview, dr. jack rasmus , a professor of economics and politics at st. marys college of california, analyzes these issues and the many challenges facing the greek and european economies today. 
the author of such books as  looting greece  and  systemic fragility in the global economy , dr. rasmus shares his insights into the consequences of austerity for greece and other peripheral european economies, and presents his proposed solutions for an end to the crisis and austerity. 
mintpress news mpn in september, greek prime minister alexis tsipras gave his annual state of the nation address, where he boasted that the greek economy has turned the corner, that unemployment is going down, that salaries will be increased, and that the country is returning to growth. is this what greeces economic indicators actually show? protesters march to the greek parliament in athens on tuesday nov. 6, 2012. greeces unions are holding their third general strike in six weeks to press dissenters in the countrys troubled coalition government not to back a major new austerity program that will doom greeks to further hardship in a sixth year of recession. two days of demonstrations are planned to start tuesday, continuing until lawmakers vote late wednesday on the bill to slash euro13.5 billion 17.3 billion from budget spending over two years. ap photodimitri messinis 
dr. jack rasmus jr no, not quite. greeces debt is still the same as it was in 2011, roughly 180 percent of gdp. unemployment has come down by only 3 to 4 percent, so instead of 27 percent, its about 23 to 24 percent. thats depression-level unemployment. all the other indicators in the economy are flat or declining, so i dont see anywhere that greece is really recovering, and neither, really, is the entire eurozone economy. its been bouncing along the bottom. 
as i said in my book systemic fragility, its a case of chronic stagnation. the eurozone might grow a little, 0.5 percent or 1 percent above gdp, mostly as a result of germanys growth, then it flattens out or goes below. most of the periphery economies in europe are stagnant or in a recession, as they have been for quite some time. 
as far as raising wages, greece cannot raise, at least in the public sector, any wages without the approval of the troika greeces three major lenders the european commission, european central bank, and the international monetary fund. its a real stretch to say that greece is recovering. its kind of moving sideways, in the condition of still chronic economic depression. 
mpn one of the perceptions that has been prevalent in global public opinion with regard to the economic crisis in greece is that the country has been bailed out with billions upon billions of euros in free money. is this really the case, and where has the so-called bailout money to greece actually gone? 
jr countries dont get bailed out. governments, banks, businesses, and sometimes, though not so frequently, households get bailed out. so the question is, who got bailed out here, in the debt restructuring deals of 2010, 2012, 2015, and this past spring? the banks got bailed out several times. foreign investors and speculators in greek bonds and other securities clearly got bailed out in 2012. if you look at where the money has gone, theres 400 billion in debt in greece still, that they have to pay off, with an economy that is less than half that size, so its impossible. 
where has all this money gone? recent studies by the european school of management and technology documenting the 2010 and 2012 bailouts indicate that 95 percent of all the loans to bail out the greek government, which then bailed out the greek banks  95 percent of that went back to northern europe, mostly to the german and northern european banks that had loaned so much money to greece. bailout funds also went to the troika, particularly the european commission, that then distributed it to the banking system and investors in turn. the ec is the big player here, and to some extent the european central bank, and to a minor extent now the international monetary fund. so, 95 percent of all the money loaned to greece went right back to europe and less than 5 percent of that went back into the greek economy. greece has been subsidizing the financial system elsewhere in europe. a supporter of the communist-affiliated union pame takes part in an anti-austerity rally in front of the parliament in athens, monday, oct. 17, 2016. 
mpn what do you believe needs to be done about the greek debt? 
jr you might ask what needs to be done about debt throughout the eurozone, because its not just greece. greece is perhaps the most serious case, but other places in the periphery of europe are still heavily indebted. you cannot sustain, with austerity measures designed to pay the interest and principal on debt, a 400-plus billion debt based on an economy thats less than 200 billion. even the imf has come to that conclusion and is maneuvering with the other troika members on that particular point. 
is the debt legitimate? well, you have to understand the origins of this debt. it was originally private sector debt that was created as a result of the formation of the eurozone in 1999, the ecb as part of that creation, and other elements of the eurozone agreements, particularly the lisbon strategy that germany adopted. germany and other northern european businesses and bankers pumped money and capital into the periphery, including greece, from 2005 onward. germany had a strong competitive advantage in exports, so a lot of the money and capital was pumped into the periphery, including greece, in order to purchase german and other exports. so the money went in and circulated around, leaving a pile of private sector debt in greece, italy, and other places. 
then we had the crash of 2008-2009 and the debt could not be repaid, and the troika stepped in to offer the governments of greece and other countries money in order to continue to bail out the private sector and enable the repayment of the private debt. so it starts out as private debt, because of this great imbalance in exports within the eurozone, and then that gets converted to government debt, and then the big crash of 2008-2009 adds even more debt, and then you have the recession of 2011-2013 in the eurozone and the 2012 bailout, which piled on more debt in order to pay the old debt, and then in 2015 the same thing. so the troikas piling more debt on greece in order for greece to pay the previous debt, and thats totally unsustainable. theyre going to have to expunge some of that debt. 
of course, the germans, wolfgang schauble the german finance minister and the coalition in the north, does not want to allow that. and they dont really want to change the eurozone, because the eurozone, while very imbalanced for the periphery, has benefited germany significantly. the germans dominate the finance ministers council in the ec and they dominate the ecb, and theyre just keeping the situation the way it is because its profitable for them. demonstrators hold a poster against the austerity policy of germany prior to a special session of the parliament bundestag on negotiations with greece for a new bailout in berlin, germany, friday, july 17, 2015. ap photomarkus schreiber 
mpn why must greek banks be nationalized, in your view? 
jr look at the debt negotiations of 2010, 2012, and 2015. what happened was the ecb, which pretty much controls the greek central bank  the ecb is just a council of central banks dominated by the bundesbank the german central bank and its allies, so they have control  and what you saw in the negotiations is that in 2015, the ecb put the screws to the greek economy, and syriza collapsed and agreed each time the screws were tightened, bringing the economy to a halt. they couldnt deal with the squeeze on the economy by the ecb. this brought the economy to a halt, squeezing it and of course not releasing loans that the troika had agreed to provide greece under previous agreements. there was an economic squeeze that syriza did not have a strategy to deal with, and eventually it capitulated. 
youve got to nationalize, make the greek central bank and the banking systems independent of the ecb. gain control over your economy once again, and that is one of several key steps to prevent the squeeze every time you attempt to renegotiate the debt or restructure the debt. without an independent, greek, people-controlled banking system, the eurozone and the troika will squeeze and bring greece to its knees every time. weve seen that three times. youve got to nationalize the banking system, including the central bank, or if you want to just leave the central bank as part of the ecb structure, go ahead, but create an independent central bank authority elsewhere in the greek government. 
in the u.s. during the great depression, the u.s. central bank had screwed up badly, and president franklin delano roosevelt took over and had his treasury department take over and run the economy. greece would have to set up a parallel central bank in its finance sector, and isolate and bypass the influence of the ecb through the greek central bank. you would have to create a parallel currency as part of this and impose serious controls on bank withdrawals and capital flows outside the country, which syriza did not really do, because the ecb and the troika opposed it. when you have all the capital, bank withdrawals and capital flight is another way of squeezing the country economically. file  in this sunday, oct. 18, 2015 file photo, a man walks past street art depicting greek prime minister alexis tsipras and german chancellor angela merkel in athens, greece. tsipras decision to sign off on a bailout led to many in his left-wing syriza party to quit in protest. 
mpn the current government in greece has been continuing a policy of massive privatizations of greek public assets, with profitable airports and harbors having been privatized in the past year, in addition to the recent selloff of the greek national railroad for a total of 45 million 49 million. what are the short- and long-term impacts of the privatization of such public assets? 
jr the short-term is that when you privatize them, under the aegis of the troika, if you sell below market prices, which a lot of these assets are being sold at, thats profit on the sale for the investors who are buying up these assets. but once the assets are in private hands, where does the revenue go? does it go back into greece or does it go back into the pockets of the investors and the corporations and the banks outside greece that are buying it up? well, it goes out. its a form of capital flight. money that is needed in greece flows out of greece. 
this is a new form of financial imperialism, wealth extraction in other words, that is being structured and managed on a state-to-state basis. its not 19th century british imperialism where they set up a factory in india, paid them low wages, and brought the textiles back to london to re-sell at a higher price. its not that kind of production imperialism. this is financial imperialism imposed on greece, and its a new form thats emerging everywhere, where you indebt the country and then you force the country to engage in austerity in order to pay the principal and interest on the debt, and you extract the income from the country. privatizations are another form of that. 
you privatize public goods, you get them at fire-sale prices, and then the income flows from those assets flow back to the coffers of the private companies or the banks, outside of greece. 
the other consequence is when you privatize, they come in and they cut costs, which means they lay off people in mass numbers, they put a hold on wages, they get rid of benefits, and they do everything else to maximize their revenue. 
finally, longer term, it means that greece has less control over its own economy if it cant control its infrastructure and everything is owned by foreigners. then you cant influence it as much, and if youre part of the eurozone, youre legally prohibited from what you can do to make sure that these foreign-owned infrastructure companies are behaving in terms of the benefit for the public sector, for the rest of greece. 
mpn you have argued in your book, systemic fragility in the global economy, that there are nine major trends which account for the economic troubles that are seen on a global scale. what are some of these trends? 
jr everywhere, and particularly since 2008, we see central banks and monetary policy to be ascendant, and that means creating money, pumping it into the economy to bail out the financial systems, the financial institutions, the banks and the shadow banks, meaning speculators, hedge funds, private equity firms, asset management companies, and so forth. weve seen bailouts of tens of trillions of dollars since 2008. all of that liquidity injection into the economy has driven interest rates down to zero or even, in europe and japan and elsewhere, negative rates, and that fuels debt. with rates that cheap, corporations and businesses float new corporate bonds, and they use the money not to invest necessarily, they use it to buy back the stock and drive up the stock prices and pay out dividends, or they sit on it, they hoard it, or they send it to emerging markets. thats a problem everywhere, and thats the result of massive liquidity injections, which have really been escalating since the 1980s, when controls on international capital flows were eliminated everywhere. 
after the 1970s, when the bretton woods system collapsed and central banks took over, the combination of those has led to the financialization of the global economy in the 21st century, where profits are far greater for investing and speculating in financial securities than they are in investing in real assets and real things that create real jobs and real income and real consumption. were becoming dependent on debt more and more. the economy is increasingly credit- and debt-driven, and thats the result of this massive liquidity injection, and it also leads to a shift from real asset investment  investing in real things that create jobs that people need  toward financial asset investment. that means that real investment collapses over time and productivity collapses over time as well, and we see that happening everywhere. 
thats a major point that i argued about in my book, systemic fragility, this financialization of the global economy based on liquidity and debt and squeezing out. its diverting money and capital from real investment into financial speculation. whats going on in greece is a concrete expression of this, the reliance on financial means and financial manipulation. the periphery in the eurozone is at a great disadvantage to germany and others, and theyre being manipulated financially. all the payments on interest and the debt flow back to the north. this is all flowing through the ec to the private sector, and its a nice constant money capital flow from interest payments and privatization and speculation on government bonds and securities and stocks in these countries as the volatility occurs. 
its a reflection, in greece, of whats happening on a broader scale elsewhere in the global economy, and thats why we havent seen much of a recovery in the global economy. global trade is stagnant and real investment everywhere is drifting toward zero, productivity is negative almost everywhere, even in the u.s., and were seeing growth rates of barely 1 percent, 1.5 percent, at best, when it should be double that. we see these growing, non-performing bank loans, almost 2 trillion in europe, the worst in italy with about 400 billion. we see the same thing in japan and in china. were becoming more systemically fragile financially because of this shift to financial speculation. in this july 5, 2012 file photo president of the european central bank mario draghi speaks during a news conference in frankfurt, central germany. ap photodapd, mario vedder, file 

mintpress what is your outlook for the eurozone economy and the difficulties that it is currently facing? 
jr the european banking system has never fully recovered from the 2008-2009 crash. the ecb is pumping money into the banking system in various ways, long-term refinancing options and all the bailout funds and qualitative easing and negative interest rates and so forth. theyre desperately pumping money into the banking system, but the banks arent really lending, at least to those businesses that would reinvest in real assets to create jobs. its far more profitable to make money now. investors make more money from financial speculation than they do from investing long-term and expecting to get a return over 10 to 20 years for investment in a real company that creates real things. 
we can see the strains now with the non-performing loans, in particular in italy. of course, we know the situation with the non-performing bank loans in greece. portugal is in bad shape as well in terms of non-performing loans, and now we see even institutions like germanys deutsche bank and others beginning to feel this strain, and the further impact on the european banking system of the brexit the departure of great britain from the european union. 
the problem is that the private banks are either hoarding the cash, they wont invest in real growth, or theyre sending their money offshore to emerging markets, or theyre using it, as in the u.s., to buy back stock and pay out dividends and loaning money to companies to do just that. the global economy has changed dramatically in ways that make it much more fragile than ever before. a lot of debt has been building up everywhere over 50 trillion in additional debt has occurred since 2009, and when the next recession comes, how are they going to pay that debt? 
when times are stable or growing, you can add debt without a great crisis emerging, but when you have a recession or a downturn thats significant, where are you going to get the money capital to pay the principal and interest on the debt? then you start seeing defaults and you start seeing financial asset price collapses going on, and now youre back in 2008-2009. thats the picture of the global economy. a farmer tries to protect himself as he clashes with a riot policeman during an anti-government protest at central syntagma square in athens, wednesday, nov. 18, 2015. greek farmers protesting over planned tax and pension reforms demanded by the countrys bailout creditors have clashed outside parliament with police, who used tear gas to disperse them. ap photoyorgos karahalis 
mpn what would be the steps for greece to follow, in your view, in order to escape the spiral of economic depression and austerity? 
jr syriza made it clear, when it came into power, that it was not in favor of grexit a greek departure from the eurozone, and it has always maintained that position. an unprepared, were leaving the eurozone and the euro kind of decision would cause a collapse of values, particularly among those who have investments in some savings in greece. to some extent, syriza was caught between a rock and a hard place here. they couldnt or didnt want to advocate an exit, and at least those who had investments didnt want it because of the potential effect on their investments. the broader greek populace thinks, still, that to be european you have to be in the eurozone. thats a big mistake. 
i think what greece and syriza should have done is to create a parallel currency and to take over its banking system. in other words, make the banking system truly independent, including the greek central bank, and if that was not possible, bypass the greek central bank and set up a central banking function in the finance ministry, as the u.s. has done at different times. create a parallel currency, and policies and programs to get people to convert their euros into the parallel currency. maybe declare that henceforth all taxes to the greek government will be paid with the parallel currency, and that means that people would then trade in their euros for the parallel currency to pay their taxes. 
then tell the troika the ec, the ecb, and the imf  collectively, greeces lenders that were going to pay you in your euros, but if we run out of euros here as a result of the conversion, well, tough luck, we dont have a way of paying you, lets negotiate a final deal where you expunge some of it and we pay you off and we go our separate ways. of course, you would have to create significant capital flow controls, which has always been a problem every time theres been a crisis; the money flows out of greece. take the economy out of the control of the troika without a formal exit. 
that could have been done, but for some reason syriza and its finance advisers either didnt want to do that or didnt know how to do that. 
mpn arguments that have been heard against a parallel currency include the claim that the existence of two currencies would create a situation where there would be haves and have nots  between those who would hold a stronger, hard currency, compared to those holding a weaker, devalued currency. how do you respond to this? 
jr there are policies and approaches you can take that entice and require people to convert their euros into the new currency. that would raise the demand and therefore the value, the price of the new currency. if you just had the currency and you didnt have this forced trade-in, then of course you would have haves and have nots, the new currency would collapse, and pretty soon no one would want to use it. but, for example, saying that taxes could only be paid with the new currency, would force people who had corporations and businesses and so forth to purchase the new currency with the euro. it would undermine the value of the euro in greece and it would raise the value of the new currency in greece as well. that might set off a parallel elsewhere in the eurozone with other countries thinking the same thing, which would undermine the value of the euro and put the squeeze on the troika for once. greece never put the squeeze on the troika, it was just the opposite in all of these negotiations that occurred, they never really hurt the troika in negotiations, and thats the only way you prevail in negotiations. youve got to make it unpleasant for the opposition. syriza never did that, they played along and made concession after concession. 
syriza thought that their example would strike a spark elsewhere in europe of other social democratic forces and governments. they thought that they would get the rest of the social democracies behind them and together they would reform the eurozone. that was a fiction, a fantasy thought on the part of alexis tsipras and others, but that was the core of their whole strategy. european social democracy is a dying force, and thats why you see the growth on the fringes, both to the right and the left. 
tsipras and former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis problem was that they thought they could get all these elements behind them and that together they would have enough weight to force schauble and other finance ministers to make concessions. well, schauble and the other ministers, the german faction, as i call it, within the finance ministers council in the ec, remained dominant. at every step along the way, whenever syriza and its few allies tried to make a compromise where some concessions were made to them, the german faction squelched it. we saw that, for example, at the very end, when greece held the referendum in july 2015. greece held the vote, and the vote said go back and negotiate a better deal for us, and what did tsipras do? he totally caved in to the schauble faction, and then the schauble faction said, the offer we made last week is now off the table, youre going to have to accept an even worse one. so they put the screws to syriza, and syriza looked to its allies in the ec, and they totally caved in as well. things just got worse and worse until you had the final austerity agreement on august 20, 2015. 
it was a step-by-step retreat from syrizas election in january 2015, because syriza had the wrong strategy and was not engaged in certain necessary tactics. of course, the troika itself had a lot of cards to play. it would have been an uphill fight for syriza. the time where they might have been able to strike some concessions from the troika was 2012, but new democracy the center-right party in power at the time in greece was totally in the pocket of the troika, so that was impossible. 
this past spring, the imf and the troika were worried about brexit and what impact that might have on renewing grexit. so they put the screws to greece again, raised the debt even more, austerity even more, and i think another round of that is coming, because the imf wants out of the troika deal. well see what happens at the imf meeting, but they havent endorsed even the 2015 agreement because they know its unsustainable. i think the imf is maneuvering to have the ec to buy its portion of the debt, and once that happens, the ec will demand even more austerity from greece. president of france francois hollande, u.s. president barack obama, britains prime minister david cameron and germanys chancellor angela merkel attend the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip meeting at the g20 the g-20 leaders summit in brisbane, australia, sunday, nov. 16, 2014. 
mpn in the event that a parallel currency is implemented and steps are taken to maintain or strengthen its value, could that be a prelude to a switch to a national, domestic currency? 
jr yes. at some point, one currency will become dominant. you cant have two equal currencies like that. another advantage of the new currency is that it will start out at less value than the euro, and that will be used as the trading currency. that will stimulate greek exports to elsewhere, outside the eurozone. 
part of the problem is that the periphery in europe is so dependent on exports and imports to germany and the north, that it cant really engage in its own independent export strategy without cutting wages. throughout europe, you have whats called internal devaluation, when you are stuck with a currency and someone elses central bank, the ecb and the euro. you cant really engage in independent monetary policy to stimulate your economy and you cant engage in lowering your currency in order to gain some advantage in exports. youre stuck, and only the most powerful country thats most efficient and has the lowest costs is able to take advantage of global exports, and thats germany. the weaker economies of the periphery will always be at a disadvantage to germany when it comes to trying to push their exports anywhere else outside the eurozone. 
thats the lesson. the lesson is that youve got a 1999 agreement in which you have this quasi-central bank, the ecb, and you have the euro, and that arrangement significantly benefits the most efficient, low-cost producer, which is germany, at the expense of the periphery. until you have a true central bank and fiscal union to some extent, that will pump the money into the periphery to help it grow when it doesnt, you will always have the situation you have in europe right now. 
compare that to the u.s., where theres a fiscal union, so that if certain states have economic problems  the federal government can pump money into those specific locations. if you dont have a true federal government and fiscal union, you cant do that, and if your central bank is dominated by the largest economy  germany  even the monetary policy has no effect. and if its a single currency, its to the advantage of the stronger economy at the disadvantage of the weaker. 
the eurozone economy is structured to emphasize the growth of the strongest economies at the expense of the weaker, and thats not going to change. its built into the eurozone. you cannot create a currency union and a customs union without a true banking union and fiscal union. more and more countries in the eurozone are beginning to come to that conclusion, but it was foreordained. economists knew this from the beginning, and thats the tragedy. greece has tied its tail to the eurozone, dominated by germany, and it can never get out of this situation as long as germany dominates the institutions, which it does, because the whole arrangement is great for germany. a protesters carries a protest sign during a rally prior to the opening of the new european central bank ecb headquarter in frankfurt, germany, wednesday, march 18, 2015. at least four police cars were set alight and two officers injured wednesday as authorities confronted violent anti-austerity protesters ahead of the inauguration ceremony for the european central banks new headquarters ap photodpa, arne dedert 

mpn tell us about your most recent book, looting greece. 
jr its really a case study of the consequences of financialization and globalization and integration. i argue that there is this phenomenon of the smaller economies being tied into the larger economies through free trade agreements, which lead to currency unions, which lead to banking unions, and then youve got a situation like greece and the euro periphery and the problems associated with that. 
the book also takes a historical look at the origins of the greek debt, that starts in 1999 with the creation of the eurozone, the adoption of the euro by greece in 2002 and the consequences of that, how the debt developed, first in the private sector because of german export domination and then conversion of the private debt in 2008-2009 to the public debt, and then the collapse of 2008-2009, which added to the government debt. then you had the 2012 agreement where the private sector was bailed out, and that added more debt, and then 2015 and so forth. all this is described in detail in the early chapters, and then most of the book is a step-by-step look at the negotiations between syriza and the troika, from syrizas january 2015 election through the spring of 2016, and what were the strategic and tactical errors of syriza and the strategic and tactical moves by the troika which enabled it to prevail. 
at the end, the book discusses how this is a form of a new emerging financial and wealth extraction from smaller economies by the larger economies, because of the globalization and integration arrangement that exists, the emergence of financial extraction and financial exploitation, and how central banks are feeding that all. this will lead to my next book, which is about global central banks and the problems theyve created as we move to another crisis, which i think is coming in the next five years. demonstrators dressed as clowns pass by a burning police car wednesday, march 18, 2015 in frankfurt, germany. blockupy activists try to blockade the new headquarters of the ecb to protest against government austerity and capitalism. ap photomichael probst be sociable, share!",112,736268,fake

"democratic congressman threatens violence if gop tries to defund planned parenthood  daily wire democratic congressman threatens violence if gop tries to defund planned parenthood by hank berrien november 21, 2016 
the democratic congressman who is challenging house minority leader nancy pelosi, ohio rep. tim ryan, threatened a youngstown street fight if donald trump attempts to defund planned parenthood. 
speaking with jake tapper on cnns state of the union on sunday, ryan intimated that defunding planned parenthood wasnt the only stimulus he would need to launch violence. he stated, if he tries to defund planned parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we are going to have a youngstown street fight in the capitol. 
youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past; last may and august violence erupted on the streets of the city. 
ryan called trumps infrastructure plan a bunch of smoke and mirrors. he added that he didnt blame pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues i cant in good conscience hang this election around nancy pelosis neck, of course. but, moving forward, we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for donald trump, even in my district, where they voted for me and they voted for donald trump. 
ryans campaign to replace pelsoi is picking up steam; on sunday, new york rep. kathleen rice endorsed him, stating, ""he has a lot of good ideas, but maybe most importantly, he also isnt suggesting he has all the answers  he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing, that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy,"" rice said in a statement.

"president obama gets real, not revenge, on republicans by rmuse on sat, oct 29th, 2016 at 323 pm he is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in republicans' faces.   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
although this campaign season has been interesting, to say the least, there is something happening one never thought would occur. after spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the president of the united states, republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the democratic president whose approval rating and popularity are growing. 
it is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic republican candidate for the presidency, but for some gop candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. if any republican believed president obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election. 
the president is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of donald trump. president obama is also reminding republicans that  donald trump is the endpoint of eight years of gop toxic hostility . it may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that  obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every republican who ever crossed him , but he is getting some well-placed and well-warranted shots at republicans. 
two republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the presidents approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics; so it likely stunned the president that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. 
ohio senator rob portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the president to break the grip of heroin addiction. president obama took the time to excoriate portman for, 
 finally withdrawing his support from donald trump , but only  after looking at the polling. now that its politically expedient. but he has supported him up until last week? so i guess it was ok when trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that mexicans were rapists  and insulting gold star moms, making fun of disabled americans. i guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge. why was that ok? and now he says he will vote for the vice-presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports donald trump.  
the president was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the president  one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times, california republican representative daryl issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the presidents face on them and boasting about his close work with president obama  to protect victims of sexual assault . 
daryl issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the presidents wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on issa-created scandals. during a fundraiser in la jolla california sunday last, the president assailed issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the presidents image on it. the president said, 
 issas primary contribution to the united states congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. this is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. now that is the definition of chutzpah. 
as remarked by tim murphy at mother jones, president obama is not just evening up the score with republicans who made his tenure miserable,  he is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in republicans faces . 
the president clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue republicans with. he said , 
 heres the thing. for years, republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. about hillary. about harry. they said i wasnt born here. they said climate change is a hoax. they said that i was going to take everybodys guns away! they said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. this is what theyve been saying for years now! so people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true! and if the world theyve been seeing is im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though i cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like donald trump? 
and the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. there are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base, itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do, we wont be able to appoint judges, well gum up the works, well create gridlock, itll give us a political advantage. so they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. so donald trump did not start this. donald trump didnt start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. thats what he always does. and so now, when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line, all of a sudden these republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away. oh, this is too much. so when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly thats a deal-breaker. well what took you so long! what the heck! what took you so long! all these years! 
the mother jones piece made out like president obama is seeking retribution, or  revenge  against republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. without knowing what goes on in the presidents head to motivate his campaign rhetoric; that is a hard call to make with any surety. barack obama does not strike one as being vindictive. 
the president is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the white house is winding down and republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from donald trump, it is prudent of the president to remind voters exactly what republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why donald trump is their standard bearer; and why republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the white house.",133,736266,real

"comment on genius child arrested, interrogated, and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock by brian hodge home  badge abuse  genius child arrested, interrogated, and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock genius child arrested, interrogated, and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock john vibes september 16, 2015 326 comments 
irving, tx  an intelligent and talented 9th grader was arrested this week for bringing a homemade clock into school. 14-year-old ahmed mohamed is interested in electronics and has taught himself how to make his own radios and other devices. he can even repair his own go-kart. 
recently, he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers. sadly, instead of celebrating his achievement, one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb. 
when the police arrived, they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well, even though it obviously wasnt. eventually, the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb, even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock, and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it. 
the young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center, and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room. he was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of. 
here in high school, none of the teachers know what i can do, ahmed told dallas news after the incident. 
he then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created, he was warned not to show it to the other teachers. 
he was like, thats really nice, i would advise you not to show any other teachers, ahmed said. 
he then kept the clock in his bag until his english class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher. after the class, ahmed showed his teacher what was making the noise, and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school. 
she was like, it looks like a bomb, he said. 
i told her, it doesnt look like a bomb to me, he explained. 
the teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it. however, towards the end of the day, ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers. 
he said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb. 
they were like, so you tried to make a bomb?  ahmed said. 
i told them no, i was trying to make a clock. 
the officer then told him,  it looks like a movie bomb to me. 
the police even admit that ahmed never once said the device was a bomb, and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one, but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something, even though they didnt have any proof. 
we have no information that he claimed it was a bomb. he kept maintaining it was a clock, but there was no broader explanation, police spokesman james mclellan said. 
it could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car. the concern was, what was this thing built for? do we take him into custody? he added. 
they couldnt possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers. 
they thought, how could someone like this build something like this unless its a threat?, ahmed said. 
ahmeds father, mohamed elhassan mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against. 
he just wants to invent good things for mankind, but because his name is mohamed and because of sept. 11, i think my son got mistreated, he said. 
there has since been an outpour of support on social media since ahmeds story went public. he has even gotten support from mark z and president obama. cool clock, ahmed. want to bring it to the white house? we should inspire more kids like you to like science. it's what makes america great.

"us government acknowledges that al-qaeda is not a priority in syria store us government acknowledges that al-qaeda is not a priority in syria one might ask, then if al-qaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? darius shahtahmasebi  anti media - october 26, 2016 comments 
last week, the u.s. state department acknowledged that al-qaeda-linked terror group jabhat al-nusra is not a priority for the united states efforts in syria. 
one might ask, then if al-qaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? 
state department spokesman john kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating 
the only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in syria is bashar al-assad and his supporters . we recognize al-nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, ive talked about this ad nauseam. 
largely missing from the american narrative of the syrian conflict is that al-nusra is shelling residential areas in aleppo, where the government holds control of the majority of aleppos citizens. in other parts of the world, these al-qaeda-linked extremists are seen as the enemy, whereas in syria, western media will often refer to them as mere rebel groups. 
the united states first officially used the term war on terror on september 20, 2011, to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of september 11. the stated aim at the time was to defeat islamic-linked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the u.s. government accused of supporting terrorism. 
in 2013, obama stated  
 we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror, but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten america. 
the fact that a terror group  one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the united states on american soil  is not a priority of the united states state department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is. 
this change in rhetoric, which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the middle east, is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from al-qaeda-linked terrorists. newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew. related articles",92,736263,fake
"college classmate reveals horrific story of time trump hit his son in the face inside their dorm november 4, 2016 college classmate reveals horrific story of time trump hit his son in the face inside their dorm   
scott melker is a miami-based dj who reportedly attended the university of pennsylvania at the same time as one of the sons of republican presidential nominee donald trump. 
melker recently shared a disturbing story on facebook in which he claims that trump very casually physically assaulted donald trump jr. in front of his classmates, as well as the troubling behaviors of don jr., who he described as a drunk who earned the nickname diaper don. image via facebook 
before we get ahead of ourselves, we should, of course, take it for what it is worth. this is just one mans account, and for all we know, melker could have made the whole thing up. but melkers account doesnt come across as exaggerated, the alleged interaction, while disturbing, seems very understated. 
and heres what we do know about trump. 
he has bragged on video about how he felt his star status gave him permission to routinely sexually assault random women by kissing them and grabbing their genitalia against their will. 
trump has also been accused of committing numerous sexual assaults against women, including raping two young teenage girls. 
and according to his first wife, trump did not have the best of relationships with his three oldest children. during a benefit a few weeks ago, ivana trump told the crowd that she brought up the children singlehandedly. donald wasnt really interested in children until he could talk business with them. 
with so many deep character flaws, its not exactly a stretch of the imagination that he would physically lash out as well. 
if this story turns out to be true, it could explain a lot about why trumps two oldest sons are the way they are, and it could foretell a very troubling future for trumps youngest son barron, who is only 10 years old.

"not guilty the power of nullification to counteract government tyranny go to article 
the people have the power, all we have to do is awaken that power in the people. the people are unaware. theyre not educated to realize that they have power. the system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything. we are the government . john lennon 
how do you balance the scales of justice at a time when americans are being tasered , tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed , hit with batons, shot with rubber bullets and real bullets, blasted with sound cannons , detained in cages and kennels , sicced by police dogs, arrested and jailed for challenging the governments excesses, abuses and power-grabs? 
politics wont fix a system that is broken beyond repair. 
no matter who sits in the white house, the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes. 
relying on the courts to restore justice seems futile. 
indeed, with every ruling handed down, it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice, with government courts, largely lacking in vision and scope, rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law. this is true at all levels of the judiciary, but especially so in the highest court of the land, the u.s. supreme court, which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the constitution. 
even so, justice matters. 
it matters whether youre a rancher protesting a federal land-grab by the bureau of land management, a native american protesting an oil pipeline that will endanger sacred sites and pollute water supplies, or an african-american taking to the streets to protest yet another police shooting of an unarmed citizen. 
unfortunately, protests and populist movements havent done much to push back against an authoritarian regime that is deaf to our cries, dumb to our troubles, blind to our needs, and accountable to no one. 
it doesnt matter who the activists are environmentalists, peaceniks, native americans, black lives matter, occupy, or the bundys and their followers or what the source of the discontent is endless wars abroad, police shootings, contaminated drinking water, government land-grabs, the governments modus operandi has remained the same shut down the protests using all means available, prosecute first amendment activities to the fullest extent of the law, and discourage any future civil uprisings by criminalizing expressive activities, labelling dissidents as extremists or terrorists, and conducting widespread surveillance on the general populace in order to put down any whispers of resistance before it can take root. 
thus, if there is any means left to us for thwarting the government in its relentless march towards outright dictatorship, it may rest with the power of juries and local governments to invalidate governmental laws, tactics and policies that are illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional. 
just recently, in fact, an oregon jury rejected the governments attempts to prosecute seven activists who staged a six-week, armed takeover of the malheur national wildlife refuge. 
in finding the defendants not guiltyof conspiracy to impede federal officers, of possession of firearms in a federal facility, and of stealing a government-owned truckthe jury sent its own message to the government and those following the case justice matters. 
the malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility their lawyers argued the guns were as much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans. they were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers. they were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks, thereby preventing workers from performing their duties as the washington post points out, this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist left-wingers and earth first protesters . 
many other equally sincere activists with eloquent lawyers and ardent supporters have gone to jail for lesser offenses than those committed at the malheur refuge, so what made the difference here? 
the jury made all the difference. 
these seven oregon protesters were found not guilty because a jury of their peers recognized the sincerity of their convictions, sympathized with the complaints against an overreaching government, and balanced the scales of justice using the only tools available to them common sense, compassion and the power of the jury box. 
jury nullification works. 
as law professor ilya somin explains, jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the law in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive . according to former federal prosecutor paul butler, the doctrine of jury nullification is premised on the idea that ordinary citizens, not government officials, should have the final say as to whether a person should be punished. 
imagine that a world where the citizenrynot the government or its corporate controllersactually calls the shots and determines what is just. 
in a world of  rampant overcriminalization , where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day, jury nullification acts as  a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization and the increasing network of confusing laws that are passed with neither the approval nor oftentimes even the knowledge of the citizenry. 
indeed, butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises  
if you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case, i recommend that you vote not guilty  even if you think the defendant actually smoked pot, or sold it to another consenting adult. as a juror, you have this power under the bill of rights ; if you exercise it, you become part of a proud tradition of american jurors who helped make our laws fairer. 
in other words, its we the people who can and should be determining what laws are just, what activities are criminal and who can be jailed for what crimes. 
not only should the punishment fit the crime, but the laws of the land should also reflect the concerns of the citizenry as opposed to the profit-driven priorities of corporate america. 
this is where the power of jury nullification is so critical to reject inane laws and extreme sentences and counteract the edicts of a profit-driven governmental elite that sees nothing wrong with jailing someone for a lifetime for a relatively insignificant crime. 
of course, the powers-that-be dont want the citizenry to know that it has any power at all. 
they would prefer that we remain clueless about the governments many illicit activities, ignorant about our constitutional rights, and powerless to bring about any real change. 
in an age in which government officials accused of wrongdoingpolice officers, elected officials, etc.are treated with general leniency, while the average citizen is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, jury nullification is a powerful reminder that, as the constitution tells us, we the people are the government. 
for too long weve allowed our so-called representatives to call the shots. now its time to restore the citizenry to their rightful place in the republic as the masters, not the servants. 
nullification is one way of doing so. 
various cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to  claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded . 
where nullification can be particularly powerful, however, is in the hands of the juror. 
the reality with which we must contend is that justice in america is reserved for those who can afford to buy their way out of jail. 
for the rest of us who are dependent on the fairness of the system, there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day. police misconduct. prosecutorial misconduct. judicial bias. inadequate defense. prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice. judges who care more about what is legal than what is just. jurors who know nothing of the law and are left to deliberate in the dark about life-and-death decisions. and an overwhelming body of laws, statutes and ordinances that render the average american a criminal, no matter how law-abiding they might think themselves. 
if youre to have any hope of remaining freeand i use that word looselyyour best bet remains in your fellow citizens. 
your fellow citizens may not know what the constitution says studies have shown americans to be abysmally ignorant about their rights, they may not know what the laws are there are so many on the books that the average american breaks three laws a day without knowing it, and they may not even believe in your innocence, but if youre lucky, those who serve on a jury will have a conscience that speaks louder than the legalistic tones of the prosecutors and the judges and reminds them that justice and fairness go hand in hand. 
thats ultimately what jury nullification is all about restoring a sense of fairness to our system of justice. its the best protection for we the people against the oppression and tyranny of the government, and god knows, we can use all the protection we can get. its a powerful way to remind the governmentall of those bureaucrats who have appointed themselves judge, jury and jailer over all that we are, have and dothat were the ones who set the rules. 
we could transform this nation if only americans would work together to harness the power of their discontent. 
unfortunately, the governments divide and conquer tactics are working like a charm. 
despite the laundry list of grievances that should unite we the people in common cause against the government, the nation is more divided than ever by politics, by socio-economics, by race, by religion, and by every other distinction that serves to highlight our differences. 
the real and manufactured events of recent yearsthe invasive surveillance, the extremism reports, the civil unrest, the protests, the shootings, the bombings, the military exercises and active shooter drills, the color-coded alerts and threat assessments, the fusion centers, the transformation of local police into extensions of the military, the distribution of military equipment and weapons to local police forces, the government databases containing the names of dissidents and potential troublemakershave all conjoined to create an environment in which we the people are more divided, more distrustful, and fearful of each other. 
what we have failed to realize is that in the eyes of the government, were all the same. 
in other words, when its time for the government to crack downand that time is comingit wont matter whether we supported hillary or trump, whether we stood with the pipeline protesters or opposed blm, or whether we spoke out against government misconduct and injustice or remained silent. 
when the government cracks down, well all suffer. 
heres the thing the government wants a civil war. 
the objective compliance and control. 
its strategy destabilize the economy through endless wars, escalate racial tensions, polarize the populace, heighten tensions through a show of force, intensify the use of violence, and then, when all hell breaks loose, clamp down on the nation for the good of the people and the security of the nation. 
the government has been anticipating and preparing for such a civil uprising for some time now. 
those protests in ferguson , baltimore and baton rouge to protest police brutality? the militarized police  clad in kevlar vests, helmets, and camouflage, armed with pistols, shotguns, automatic rifles, and tear gas  turning towns into war zones? the kenneling of pipeline protesters in north dakota? 
those were just dress rehearsals for the government to work out the kinks in its operating manual on how to deal with civil unrest. 
they were also previews of whats in store if we continue to challenge the powers-that-be. 
after all, its hard to persuade anyone to stand against tyranny when all you can promise them as a reward is persecution, prosecution and a one-way trip to the morgue. and when the outcome seems to be a foregone conclusionthe government always winsit can seem pointless, even foolhardy, to dare to challenge the system. 
so how do you not only push back against the police states bureaucracy, corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means? 
you start by changing the rules and engaging in some nonviolent guerilla tactics. 
employ militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , which martin luther king jr. used to great effect through the use of sit-ins, boycotts and marches. 
take part in grassroots activism, which takes a trickle-up approach to governmental reform by implementing change at the local level in other words, think nationally, but act locally. 
and then, as i explain in more detail in my book battlefield america the war on the american people , nullify everything. nullify the court cases. nullify the laws. nullify everything the government does that is illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional.",70,736269,fake

cnns brian stelter calls donald trump a uniquely fact-challenged candidate, which is a prelude to introducing daniel dale, washington correspondent for the toronto star , who fact checks every single word trump utters and tallies them up for his paper . 
dale says most fact-checkers look at two or three things trump says, meticulously fact-checks them and posts an article, but that doesnt work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days. 
for example, dale tallied 35 trump lies on tuesday, october 25 donald trump said 35 false things yesterday. trumpcheck pic.twitter.comewfyfedfx9

which, as dale pointed out , followed his record-tying 37 false claims on monday, not coincidentally, a day on which trump called fact checkers scum. 
watch courtesy of cnns reliable sources ""there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty."" ddale8 says trump lies a lot more than clinton  
 reliable sources reliablesources october 30, 2016 
the mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between trump and clinton. as dale told stelter, there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty. trump, says dale, is not a normal political liar. 
for example, look at the presidential debates , in which dale found 104 trump false statements as opposed to 13 by clinton. 
dales judgment is that there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent. 
trump also lies pointlessly, argues dale, explaining to brian stelter that, 
he gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether hes lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts. 
this was mark cubans complaint, of course, that trump has no interest in learning. 
in the end, it matters less why trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that hillary clinton is the dishonest candidate. and it is working. this is a trope frequently repeated by trumps supporters. you can correct them as often as you want; it will have no effect. 
the lie has taken hold  one of many  many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. the trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as dale tweeted last night, 
if trump loses, the smart republican excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base re-education. 
given the gops history with facts, good luck with that.

the national political media didnt just cheerlead for obamacare, they lied to us. willfully and with malicious intent, they all lied to us. the outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill, right there in black and white. but the media didn't care. they wanted to give their precious obama a win and in order to do that, they jumped on board the ""you can keep your insurance"" propaganda express. worse, those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists, not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken fact-checkers. 
then utopia met reality. 
then the lies were exposed. 
and the result is that up to and including last night, at both the local and national level, obamacare has decimated the democrat party. but nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class. 
the media's role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority. from here on, they could only get more sweaty, desperate, and dangerous. 
2. casting off every journalistic ethic to destroy trump 
openly, proudly, and belligerently, in order to hijack a presidential election, we were treated to the pompous announcement that trump was such a threat to humanity, it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism, starting with objectivity. 
even former good guys like cnn's jake tapper morphed into an unrecognizable lyingsnarkvirtuesignalingmachines -- another rotting cog in the narrative wheel, a mindless member of a self-deluded, government-worshiping cult that wouldnt piss on middle america if we were on fire. 
professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag, baby! and who could miss the historic opportunity to self-righteously point-and-laugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a brave new world. 
3. grind donald trump to dust 
while there is no question trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way, never in my 50 years have i seen such a coordinated, desperate, dishonest, and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity. 
4. embracing confirmation bias 
the longer the general election rolled on, the smaller the bubble of self-delusion became. 
inconvenient polls were sneered at and voxsplained away. 
exit polls could only means one thing, even though it was pretty clear they might mean another. 
my personal favorite was the late editorials where, based on no counted votes whatsoever, we were trolled with the news that it was hillary, not trump, who would emerge victorious with the ""hidden vote!"" oh, the delicious irony of that. oh, how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes' faces on election night. 
by the time the votes were actually being counted, i was about 60 sure hillary would win. the new york times, however, was 92 sure. abcnbccbsapbsnprcnnwashingtonpostpolitico were 100 sure. 
but even i understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever, that hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper midwest, that the best pollster in the country had trump up 2, that trump never lost his fervent base, that the right trackwrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade, that there was still a larger-than-usual number of undecideds, that this thing that was real might not be enough to win, but it was still real. 
no, no, we were told, it's all smoke and mirrors, all gold-leafed trump steaks. look at obama's approval ratings! look at the hispanic vote! look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there. sit down, son, dont you understand that i'm a data machine? it's science, rube. don't you vox, racist? 
and then the worst thing imaginable happened. 
5. the media lost the election 
the hate, the lies, the removal of the mask of objectivity, the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table -- that can actually work  if you win. 
but the media didnt win. 
in the most spectacular fashion, with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see, they lost. 
and with that loss went everything. 
and now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a swaggering potemkin bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion, even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man, and do so with much of the republican party on their side. 
not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch, worse than all that, they are exposed as weak, a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again. 
without that sheen of fear, without that threat of intimidation, like a vanquished bully, so goes all their power. 
f you, mainstream media. 
-- 
the delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious barack obama correct about one thing 
the moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice.

"hillary clinton is brilliantly forcing broke trump to spend money defending arizona by jason easley on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 102 pm if donald trump wants to keep arizona in the republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because hillary clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. share on twitter print this post 
if donald trump wants to keep arizona in the republican column, he will have to spend some of his very limited time, money, and resources there, because hillary clinton is campaigning in the red state next week. 
the clinton announced that the democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in arizona, on wednesday, november 2,  hillary clinton will campaign in phoenix, arizona, days before election day. clinton will lay out what is at stake in the election. with more people voting in this election than any in history, clinton will urge arizona voters to take advantage of in-person early voting. voters can check their registration status and early vote location at iwillvote.com. 
the fact that clinton will be in usually reliably red arizona in november during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race. 
hillary clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue. 
the trump campaign already deployed vp nominee mike pence to utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling, and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving arizona to prevent clinton from winning a state that has been a given for republicans in previous elections. 
the trump campaign is broke. the nominee had to give his campaign 10 million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads. 
the clinton campaign is trying to stretch trump past his breaking point by making a serious play for arizona. it is a brilliant move from a campaign that has outwitted its republican opponent at every turn.",133,736265,real
"keith ellison as dnc chair another high place, another empty black face tweet widget a black agenda radio commentary by bar managing editor bruce a. dixon 
in a decade on the house financial services committee keith ellison hasnt targeted the credit card racketeers, or the banksters who flooded the market with predatory home and student loans or federal officials who refuse to relieve underwater homeowners. democratic party leaders need another empty black face to front the dnc, someone who blames wikileaks and the russians for hillarys defeat. ellison will do just fine. keith ellison as dnc chair another high place, another empty black face a black agenda radio commentary by bar managing editor bruce a. dixon 
in the wake of donald trumps election, democratic party honchos are scrambling to reassure their funders and to shore up the careers of democratic elected officials who serve those funders. they must justify and retain whatever hold they still have on the millions of nominal democratic voters who actually have no voice whatsoever in what their party stands for. 
at bottom, the two capitalist parties are owned by the same class of elite one percenter funders but with different voting bases at least one us party is always the self-declared white mans party. since the late sixties republicans have reserved that slot for themselves, leaving democrats to claim the allegiance of racial minorities and some other groups. the different voting bases of the two parties mean they have different campaign styles, but when the campaigns are over theyre both as barack obama affirmed, on the same team. both parties deliver the mandate of their constituencies to their common funders, big ag, big oil, big insurance, big pharma, big real estate, the military contractors and wall street. 
after the departures of debbie wasserman-schulz and donna brazile, both deeply implicated in the sabotaging of bernie sanders and hillary clintons loss, democrats need a new face at the head of the democratic national committee, the national partys executive body. ideally it should be someone who reassures the funders and can help rally the base voters. the leading contender is keith ellison, just elected to his sixth term in congress from minneapolis. 
keith ellison seems a good fit. he was the first muslim ever elected to congress, a member of the congressional black caucus and current co-chair of the large and virtually impotent house progressive caucus. he was an early endorser of bernie sanders who did his duty trying to lead leftward strays back into hillarys big tent . in a decade on the house financial services committee, ellison managed not to deeply offend the banksters who flooded the market with predatory housing and student loans, or the payday lenders and credit card racketeers, and he didnt embarrass or insult the colleagues who openly shill for them. in that target rich environment ellison managed not just to keep from hitting anything, but not even to take aim. 
by contrast, senator elizabeth warren in 2014 made headlines when she grilled ellison's former congressional black caucus colleague mel watt , on why the agency he heads, despite a clear mandate from congress to reduce the principals on potentially millions of unpayable predatory home loans, refused to reduce the principal on a single one. three years later the news is that the agency may reduce principal on a mere 3,100 home loans at most . were still waiting to hear from ellison and the other eight black democrats on the committee on this failure. 
but ellison is black. hes the first muslim elected to congress, hes smart enough and telegenic. he votes infallibly to support the apartheid regime in israel, and he says if it were up to him thered have been a no-fly zone and possible shooting war with the russians a long time ago. 
hillarys indispensable firewall was supposed to be the black vote, for which she needed to do little else than mumble about black lives mattering and pose occasionally with the mothers of some of those murdered by police. democratic shot callers seem to still believe that all they need is another empty black face in a high place. they wont get another first black president. it was hillarys turn and that didnt work out. now its keith ellisons another empty black face in a very high place.

earlier today, after a two week silence, guccifer 2.0 reemerged, with a post on his blog , in which he alleges that he has information from inside the federal election commission, according to which democrats may rig the elections. he then adds this may be possible because of the software installed in the fec networks by the large it companies. info from inside the fec the democrats may rig the elections id like to warn you that the democrats may rig the elections on november 8. this may be possible because of the software installed in the fec networks by the large it companies. as ive already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. i have registered in the fec electronic system as an independent election observer; so i will monitor that the elections are held honestly. i also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the u.s. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

"idaho mom loses two children for using medical cannabis to stop seizures idaho mom loses two children for using medical cannabis to stop seizures image courtesy of kutv.com 
by paul fassa health impact news 
an idaho mother has lost custody of her two children due to her states strict laws regarding marijuana, where it is not legal even for medical purposes for physicians to prescribe. 
kelsey osborne, 23, has lost custody of her two young children, son ryker and daughter madyson aged two and three respectively, to state child protective services cps. both children were removed even though only madyson was allegedly treated with cannabis during a horrific seizure episode. kelsey now faces the charge of causing injury to a child. 
idaho is a bastion of resistance to medical marijuana bordered by three very liberal cannabis states, washington, oregon, colorado, and one medical marijuana state that is improving its access to patients, montana. not long ago, a state congressional panel in idaho rejected a proposal to allow cbd non-psycho active cannabidiol for children with seizures. 
this allowance has been granted in several states that still oppose medical marijuana generally. theyre comfortable with allowing it due to the absence of thc chemical that makes people high with cbd oils and the fact that more and more children are severely epileptic than before, and many pharmaceutical medications are not working but worsening their conditions. 
instead, idaho governor c.l. butch otter opened up pharmaceutical research for synthetic cbd to be tested among 25 children. problem is, synthetic pharmaceuticals of any herb or plant cannot exactly duplicate the active ingredient and do not contain the entourage effect of the many balancing compounds the marijuana plant offers. 
cbd and thc are the two major cannabinoids among 60 others in the whole plant. cbd extracted from whole plant hybrid cannabis grown to minimize thc, has demonstrated strong efficacy and safety for epileptic seizures among young children. 
this was the dilemma kelsey dealt with to pull her daughter madyson from her intense agony and seizures during her withdrawal from risperdal, an anti-psychotic drug madyson was prescribed after her adverse reaction with the mmr vaccine. 
madyson was prescribed such a strong and dangerous anti-psychotic pharmaceutical because her doctor couldnt determine the cause of her aggressive behavior and angry outbursts, a manifestation of one aspect of the autism disorder spectrum. obviously, he wouldnt confirm that the mmr vaccine caused her spells of aggressive anger. most pediatricians wont dare go there. 
during madysons time with kelseys ex-husband, he took madyson off risperdal cold turkey. thats a no-no, considered by many as even more dangerous than taking the drug. 
the next day, madyson was screaming in pain, vomiting with intense seizures, hallucinating, and begging for help. evidently, kelsey was up somewhat on medical cannabis research. if cbd would have been an option, she would have allegedly used that instead. 
but thats not an option in idaho. so kelsey somehow got marijuana with thc then infused it into butter, which she spooned into a smoothie. within a half-hour, madyson was relieved of her agonizing symptoms. 
kelsey had made an appointment with madysons pediatrician and brought her there soon after using the marijuana infused butter to calm her down. the pediatrician took a blood sample. thats when the thc showed up, compelling the pediatrician to call cps and report the discovery of thc in a three year old child. 
this is what led to kelsey losing all custody of her children and being charged with causing injury to a child. her case is scheduled to be heard on december 22, 2016. a case for the legalization of medical marijuana 
a group called moms for marijuana international has picked up the cause of allowing medical marijuana for children by backing up kelsey in her fight to regain custody of her children and getting acquitted of the prosecutions charge of causing injury to a child. her trial has been extended for december. 
the cps case is based solely on the fact that cannabis is completely illegal in idaho. kelseys attorney r. thomas curl argues 
the state is relying on injury to a child because its illegal. it cannabis is illegal in idaho but they cannot demonstrate injury to this child. and if they cannot demonstrate injury to this child they are missing one of the elements of the crime. and if they are missing one of the elements, then they have no case. 
the fact is that risperdal, especially with the sudden withdrawal conducted by the father, is what caused considerable harm, or actual injury to madyson. also, that prescription was given out of refusing to acknowledge the harm allegedly caused by another legal pharmaceutical, the mmr vaccine. 
the reality is that kelseys intervention with cannabis seemed to have rescued her daughter from a hellish nightmare of agonizing seizures, pain, and constant vomiting. 
interestingly, another group similar to moms for marijuana calls itself mothers advocating medical marijuana for autism mamma . their primary mission is for medical marijuana states, which are currently increasing in number, to consider cannabis, even with thc, as a legal alternative for children diagnosed with autism. 
only one state, delaware has that provision in its medical cannabis bylaws. anecdotal reports have demonstrated that children with resistant cases of autism, especially aggressive behavior, are not always handled with cbd oils or tinctures. 
often it takes the full spectrum of cannabis oil with thc. until autism is included as a valid reason for using cannabis, families have to resort to using one or more physiological manifestations of autism that fit within any states allowances for their autistic children to benefit. 
kelsey osbornes case may prove to be instrumental in furthering the cause of permitting autism to be included in several medical marijuana states, which have expanded significantly in the recent november 8th, 2016 election.

"we are aliens because our souls are extra-terrestrial . we are aliens because our souls are extra-terrestrial we are in this physical world, but we are not from this world. it is important to understand that ...  we are in this physical world, but we are not from this world. it is important to understand that there is an evolution of souls going on through the earthly experience, but also a development for every individual soul. this is how the passage into higher and higher dimensions can be explained in simple terms. there are many immature souls on planet earth, and also many misguided souls. other souls do not possess the best intentions, or are simply controlled by beings without a body , whose intentions and evolutionary process are not commendable. many dope addicts and alcoholics have this unfavorable trait as do many selfish and greedy people.few humans, because of their inclinations or because of their immaturity allow unknowingly those beings to manipulate them from time to time. the beings i am referring to, are not yet developed as souls, nor do they possess a higher self or higher conscious awareness  only the mortal and limited intellect. this is by no way a reproach towards them, since most souls are going through a similar process of evolution on earth, where beings are not born consciously aware, unlike on some other planets. humans on earth, because of heredity, do need conscious spiritual work on themselves in order to set themselves free from their genetic compromised dna and intelligence, and clear their karma in order to ascend to higher dimensions and levels of existence. in other words, perhaps it would help to compare a developing soul on earth to that of one of earths children. when the child grows, he develops certain physical attributes, but also awareness, his feelings and understanding, his brain and endocrine system are in formation. souls undergoes a similar development; they need various experiences to mature, and develop consciousness. the universe is in perpetual growth  creation never stops. life comes under various forms, obeys various rules, and there are as many possibilities as universes. your planet has a heavy history of genetic manipulation and experimentation. your kind, the pure physical human kind, was developed around a soul, in order to experience a 3d dimension level of density, so souls had in effect to descend down the octave of creation in order to experience duality. this occurred because of the atlantean fall of your civilization the anunnaki, mankind's enslavement and the afterlife deception however, many of you have previously lived in much higher densities, but because of the fall, you had to learn to adapt to this 3d dimensional density, which was never meant to be your natural home. other souls have also volunteered to experience life in lower densities, or were sent here from higher densities in order to further their understanding of your world or of their own world or simply in order to help our prime creator on your world. these beings come from a higher plane of existence, which is their natural habitat. none of you, who are reading these messages or have a deep spiritual need, have been created in the 3d dimension, and you long to return home, where you have been created, to a higher dimension. the physical born beings will, in time, mature and become conscious enough to evolve into higher dimensions. these are the ones who are not aware of their higher self, but are given the experience here in order to make them aware of their potential. this is a natural process for all souls, as all souls will eventually make their journey back home towards our prime creator. it is important for you to comprehend also that although all humans look alike, their inner abilities vary greatly . have you also considered the fact that some civilizations are so old and advanced that they can create soulless beings? such beings are called clones or things on your world. this technology is already available to your scientists, and they can create or copy a human body, such as one would grow a plant. however, these beings do not possess a soul , because they were not created by our common creator, but are the results of mechanical genetic engineering. this is another reason why some humans would not have a higher self. while their external appearance is in no way different to that of ordinary humans, the spark of divine life force and consciousness is not inside of them. those beings have mixed their mechanical genetic material with humans having a soul, which has led to much dna damage. there are many animals which are in human form, but not all animals are beasts, nor are all beasts animals. the earths population is comprised of many souls, with many different contracts, coming from various densities of consciousness. what man mistakes for thinking is but an intellectual awareness of things sensed and recorded within the cells of his brain for repetitive usage through what is termed ""memories."" memories have no more relation to knowledge of universal mind which is in man, than a computer records are related to the source of their recordings. what he thinks of as his living body is but an obedient and motivated mechanical construct which simulates life through motion extended to it from its soul, which alone lives and wills the body to move. your physical clay body is terrestrial, but that is not you. your soul, that consciousness which you are, is that which has a temporary physical experience for its own development. the mechanical clay body you use has a conscious experience. but you are that consciousness. the physical world and anything in it cannot and never has created conscious awareness. intelligence, as found in snakes or spiders, yes, but not conscious awareness. some people think that the human body  which is flesh evolved at conscious awareness  is soul, by some totally unexplained and totally unproven method. think of that for a minute, pilgrim. common sense tells us that it is not reasonable that the human sex act can create a soul in the prime creators image, since if it was so, we would not be creations of the prime creator, but of our physical parents mortal mechanical primate bodies. the human body, which your physical parents gave you, is the vehicle you use. but you are the soul , created in the prime creators image, using the human flesh body your parents made ready for you to use. and if a soul is pre-existent, which it is, and can enter into a body at some time in the babys development stage and leave the body when it dies, then logic and reason tells us that the soul can also enter many more times. all the physical effects in your life are only the effects of the thoughts of your conscious mind. the so-called sins and evil are not in the action of what your mechanical body does, but in the thoughts that come from what you think. your soul is accountable and will reap its own harvest. all the actions and words of your body are the effects of your thoughts. countless religious and cultural teachings, as well as many different philosophies, commands us to do good, but sadly, goodness is still veiled like in a thick mist. many souls have been stumbling in darkness, scraping their knees; but worry not, for eventually they all learn to walk! soon after this dark period we live in, there will be so much light that you will have to wear shades. new information and better comprehension periodically transforms mankind into more conscious beings and a new awareness cycle  which will last for many thousands of years to come  is now commencing. the prime creators omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence are centered in the consciousness of each and every man; but there are only few who know of the oneness of their soul with the creator. man requires millennia to become aware of that. each cycle brings him nearer to the awareness of his oneness with the source. mankind lives in a bewildering complex world of effects and doesnt know the original cause . because of its seemingly infinite multiplicity and complexity, mankind fails to see or visualize the simple underlying principle of all things. he complicates truths and half-truths until its many angles, sides and facets have lost balance with each other and with him. all knowledge exists and is available. all knowledge will come to mankind in its own season, as needed. enlightened souls and messengers, periodically come and give such universal knowledge, but only when man is able to comprehend it and only that he can bear at the moment, for man is just beginning to comprehend the wholeness. when we will master enlightenment, we will know no limitations  but man must know the light within oneself, the ever present universal consciousness . and man must want to know and to experience it oneself and then no one can tell otherwise, for light knows light intuitively. mankind is aware of some of these illusions, but we are not aware of the fact that all effects are not what they seem to be. thus we are misled into forming conclusions which have no relation to nature and reality whatsoever. an intelligent person has mostly knowledge of the effect, but all real knowledge and understanding lies in the cause. new fundamental laws and principles must be based upon knowledge of the cause . what little knowledge man has acquired during these last few thousand years, has been given to us by the very few geniuses, prophets, mystics and other messengers of the light who have come to re-inspire mankind with their insight and knowledge. from these rare few, the beginnings of our culture have sprung. without them there would be no understanding of beauty in this materialistic world. without grasp of beauty man would still be living in caves. through beauty alone will man gradually become consciously aware of his oneness with the light? when man knows the light he will know all things. today, that light is so dim in all men that no one, perhaps only a few, have fathomed the secret of light, life, love, growth, reincarnation and about the third wave of souls entering now . the great unanswered questions of man have simple answers. the silent voice within every man is ceaselessly whispering it to his awakening consciousness. every desire written upon the heart of man is carried to the source of the original cause, and its answer will come, but only few ask from their heart and there are fewer still who listen. many are the ages of preparation for worthiness, for man's consciousness is insulated from his source by the sensations of his per-conditioned intellect and his selfish personal self which he wrongly thinks of as being his mind. what man calls his objective human mind intellect is mortal and the seat of both right and wrong information absorption and a multitude of vibrating sensations of his mortal body. what he calls his subjective mind is his sub-consciousness, his spiritual storehouse of memory of all-knowledge, all power, and all-presence. that consciousness is his individual self, his eternal self through which his omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence are expressed as he slowly becomes aware of their presence within him. the electrically vibrating nerve-wires which operate his bodily mechanism act almost entirely through automatic reflexes and instinctive control, and to a very little extent through mental decisions. each cell and organ of his body has an electrical awareness of its purpose and each fulfills that purpose without any mental action whatsoever upon the part of the intelligence which occupies that body. the heartbeat, for example, is purely automatic. the white corpuscles of the blood rush to repair an injury to the body as automatically as a bell rings when a button is pushed. in this body and its electric recording brain, man thinks that he thinks and lives, loves and dies. he thinks himself conscious while awake and unconscious when sleeping  unaware that in all nature there is no such condition as unconsciousness when sensation ceases in sleep. man does not say that his tooth is unconscious when it is put to sleep by short-circuiting the electric current in the nerve-wire which gives sensed electrical awareness to his tooth. he knows that his tooth cannot be conscious, but he does not know that his mechanical body cannot be conscious. nor does he yet know that consciousness never sleeps, and never changes, for consciousness in man is his immortality. man is still new. he is barely out of the dark of his jungle of ignorance. for the million or more years of his unfolding he has relied upon sensation for his actions and the evidence of his senses for his knowing. few have been aware of the spirit life force, conscious awareness in them. in this beginning of his new awareness he is confused, not knowing which is mind in him, which is consciousness in him and which is sensation. he has not yet learned that bodies are but self-created mechanisms which manifest their centering self, and that self manifests the prime creator as one with it. dolores cannon  we are living in the most important time in the history of the universe  likewise, he has not yet learned that bodies neither live nor die, but repeat themselves continuously ashes to ashes, dust to dust. and forever as all idea of mind likewise repeats itself. free will is a gift to everybody from our creator, by following orthodox religions, scriptures, man-made systems, having blind faith, or admiring individual orators blindly without pondering and wondering if the information you get is real, truthful, or not, many have abdicated their own god given free will to the will of others by being followers and joiners. they became the effects of other people instead of making their own cause by being creative, just like the prime creator. like being loving co-creators. think, make up your own mind about what is real and good and what is not! there is so much good in all of us, so use it lavishly and unselfishly toward everybody, but dont be naïve or gullible. if something doesnt make sense, it is non-sense. if you dont search, you wont find. light will not come from others, it comes from within your own consciousness  it is already there waiting to escape. there is no dead, ever. the body was never alive; it is a created machine that gets the life force and instructions from the soul consciousness that uses it  but only temporarily. yes, we are aliens  extra-terrestrials. humbly compiled in love,i am rene descartes, humansarefree.com i am still conscious, therefore i

"the catholic church uses tax-exempt funds to stop marijuana legalization by rmuse   1003 am ""the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. if passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries""   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
for almost all secular humanists, organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation. throughout recorded history, the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents, but any humans it comes in contact with. that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the 21st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women. apparently, the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population. 
on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a last-ditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use. other reports reveal that the tax-exempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure, question 4 . question 4 simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over 21 and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts. question 4 contains no references to the catholic, or any other church, and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries . 
a spokesman for the boston archdiocese, terrence donilon, made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying  
 it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. its a recognition that, if passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries . 
seriously, that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use tax-free congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered. nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned, much less affected by the outcome of an election. catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis. and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes, the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes, and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women. no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry, but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession, free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests, and relieve americas over-burdened judicial system. 
now, the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally, whether they inhale or eat it, will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries . that is an odd assertion on yet another point; surely part of catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible. it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet, including those in massachusetts, are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter 2, verse 9 the catholics  almighty god  said 
 out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food.  and he continues in verses 15-17 ,  then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it. the lord god commanded the man, saying, from any tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die . 
although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities 10,000 years ago , there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;  weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past two-thousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal. 
in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with tax-exempt money, an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question 4, jim borghesani, said  
 the archdiocese has come up with a position that, frankly, we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science. what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color, to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested . 
one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans, mainly americans of color, sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat . obviously, that is the case and according to a new set of data, keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every 25 seconds of every day of the year. 
why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed war on drugs in general, and the criminalization of marijuana in particular? as noted by michael stone over at patheos, what the massachusetts catholics, and mormons, are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color . mr. stone really nails it when he said that by spending tax-exempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana; the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow . 
the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy, besides implicit racism. because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using tax-exempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible . mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry, but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites; at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned. 
the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an anti-marijuana super pac , but they are using tax-exempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives; the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society. however, if the church is so flush with money; why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests? or, dog forbid, use that tax-exempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need. 
the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents, and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right, what is wrong, and how to stay out of the proverbial hell; that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity. but for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated tax-exempt money to impact read control their private lives. the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question 4 will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hard-earned money. 
this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen, except donald trump. it is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with tax-exempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans, many of whom use recreational cannabis.

"george and laura bush celebrate their 70th birthdays  daily wire george and laura bush celebrate their 70th birthdays by hank berrien october 26, 2016 
on saturday, former president george w. bush and former first lady laura bush celebrated their 70th birthdays together in crawford, texas. 
president bushs birthday was july 6, and lauras is on november 4. 
some of the attendees included former commerce secretary donald evans, dallas cowboys owner and general manager jerry jones, and ross perot jr., the son of h. ross perot. george strait performed, and sang happy birthday, per people. typical of bushs down-home style, he wore jeans, a western-style shirt and a prominent belt buckle. 
the dinner included an avocado and grapefruit salad, mesquite smoked peppered beef tenderloin, southern fried catfish, roasted corn and poblano pudding, bourbon carrots, and cheddar and black pepper biscuits. the dessert was a texas chocolate sheet cake. 
bush also invited guests to his art studio at the ranch, dubbed studio 43, where he works on his paintings. 
laura bush was working as a librarian in the austin independent school district when she met george in 1977; their friends joe and jan o'neill invited them to a barbecue. they were married in november 1977 at the first united methodist church in midland, where she had been baptized. she wore a tan, two-toned dress she had bought off the rack. 
george w. bush later called his proposal to his wife the ""best decision of my life."" laura, an only child, said she gained ""brothers and sisters and wonderful in-laws"" and made her feel part of the family. tags",43,736264,real

the republican nominee begged clinton voters to change their vote in 6 states where its not too late to do so. trump wrote wednesday morning, so now that you can see hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to make american great again! you can change your vote in six states. so, now that you see that hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to make america great again! 
 donald j. trump realdonaldtrump november 2, 2016 
tuesday evening trump made the case that due to the fbis announcement about clintons emails voters might have buyers remorse , a lot of things have happened over the last few days. this is a message for any democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for hillary clinton and are having a bad case of buyers remorse  in other words you want to change your vote  wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think youve made a mistake. 
while its true that people in some states can change their votes, its not true that this rule was changed because of hillary clintons emails and yes, thats a new right wing thing apparently. trump doesnt suggest the law was changed because of clinton, but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about clinton because of the non-surprise october surprise! the republican fbi director delivered , which was perceived to have benefited the trump ticket. 
days ago, snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the fbis bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to clinton. 
claim after fbi director jim comey announced that he was reviewing e-mails potentially linked to hillary clinton, several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes. mixture 
whats true some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day. 
whats false no states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for hillary clinton to change their votes. 
and to make this even better, that false information was based on a fox news report that wasnt selling the false story about clinton, but still got some of the information wrong. this is why the right cant have nice things. the left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular, because epistemic closure leads to losing. 
trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping, exhaustive list of lawsuits, bragging about sexual assault, dissing minorities and a gold star family, and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaigns ties to russia. 
only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a clinton aides emails when they dont even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet.

"russia to beef up western defenses with s-400's to counteract us-nato threat november 21, 2016 - fort russ news -  rianovosti - translated by j. arnoldski -  


in response to the deployment of american missile defense systems in europe, russia is being forced to strengthen its aerospace defenses on its western borders, viktor ozerov, the chairman of the federation councils committee on defense and security, told ria novosti. 
as a responsive measure against such a type of threat, we will be compelled to strengthen our aerospace defense system in the western direction and put into operation additional forces and means for resolving the covering of relevant facilities and control points. this strengthening of forces will include the deployment of s-400 and iskander complexes in kaliningrad, as well as the creation of new formations in the western and southern military districts, the senator said. 
ozerov remarked that one of the arguments which russia has put forward in relation to the deployment of american missile systems in europe is the fear that this infrastructure could be promptly converted to accommodate strike weapons, particularly land-based cruise missiles. 
these fears are being confirmed today, ozerov stated. 
according to the senator, along with motorized infantry and tank units, the divisions being created in the western and southern military districts will include troops and anti-air defense means. in addition, we are not hiding this, we are improving our aerospace forces and developing new, modern missiles of both the land-air and air-land classes which would be capable of overwhelming the air defenses that the us has in europe, ozerov explained. 
senator ozerov added that the additional deployment of arms capable of neutralizing the us missile defense threat is a symmetrical response. according to him, russia is constantly monitoring the situation and is ready to respond. 
in may of last year, the construction of the aegis ashore facility was completed which includes american missile systems in the vicinity of the romanian town of deveselu. another such facility is to appear by 2018 in northern poland. 

moscow has repeatedly stated that the us and natos actions in deploying anti-missile defense systems in europe represent a threat to russias national security and could undermine strategic stability in the region.

on wednesdays show, mika brzezinski noted that emanuel, a former adviser to president barack obama is often called one of the architects of the affordable care act.

a day before, there were not many smiles when emanual appeared on cnn and told jake tapper the extent of obamacares fiscal effects.
theres a million people for whom this is going to be severe or uncomfortable, he said.
earlier this week, the obama administration announced that the average premium costs will rise 25 percent next year. however, some states were far higher. a popular  silver healthcare plan is scheduled to increase 116 percent in arizona; 40 percent in north carolina; and 53 percent in pennsylvania.
emanuel said the problem of rising premiums some americans will have trouble affording is just part of the way obamacare evolved.

these price increases that were seeing this year are a one-time increase relative to the fact that insurance companies didnt know who was going to come in, under-priced their premiums in the first few years, and are readjusting them based on whos in the marketplace, said emanuel, suggesting that tweaking the system will fix the problem.

"marco rubio inches closer to unemployment as poll shows florida senate race tie a ppp poll of florida found 
candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in florida. democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by four points 4844, and democratic u.s. senate candidate patrick murphy is tied with republican incumbent sen. marco rubio, 4646. by an almost two to-one margin, 5126, florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for u.s. senate who supports strengthening gun laws, suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month. 
the poll was conducted by ppp the americans for responsible solutions pac, and it illustrates the dilemma that the florida senate race has created for democrats. democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive florida media, but there are polls that suggest that sen. marco rubios democratic challenger, rep. patrick murphy, has a chance of winning the seat. 
if rep. murphy can beat sen. rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to rubios national political career or at least force the florida republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. 
democrats have a real chance to send marco rubio to the unemployment line. rubio has been a disinterested senator, who just like ted cruz, seems only interest in his senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions. rubio has provided poor service to his constituents , and doesnt deserve to return to the us senate. 
sen. rubio has refused to commit to serving his full senate term, which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them. 
democrats have a chance to solidify their potential senate majority by sending marco rubio home. with cash to spend and less than two weeks left in the campaign, theyd be foolish not to take it.

i went there to get a veterans meal and all was good. i had my service dog with me because i am on dialysis and he monitors my bp. i ordered the waitress was wonderful. it took about 35 mins for meal to come. so when it attived i gave her a tip as asjed for a take out. she said sure, at that point a old white guy wearing a trump flag shirt walked buy me on hi way to the bath room. he came back and aked me what unit did i serve in the 24th. i said no the 25th. he said he was in world war 2 in germany and we did not see people like you over there. they would no allow blacks. i just listened he left then came back to bathroom again and pet my dog. so waitress put foid in container. then the managers comes and says a somes guest at the restaurant say that your not a real soldier. i reply what are you serious what guest. the manager wesly patrick said can i see military id. i felt that was reasonable i most people ask for that so i shoed him my id it checked out. at that point all he should have said was sir i am sorry thank you for your service and i would have left. but instead ge says  tbe guest also says that your service dog is not a service dog. now thats when igot upset and started recording so see for yourself what happened. 
watch the altercation here 
chilis did respond by saying  
we are aware of the situation that happened at our chilis cedar hills location yesterday. our goal is to make every guest feel special. unfortunately, we fell short on a day we strive to honor our veterans and active military for their service. we have escalated this to the highest levels of our company. 
hopefully, all of this will be resolved properly and walker given the respect that he deserves. 
the fact that some manager of a local chilis restaurant felt so bold to question anyones service to deny them a meal is just beyond comprehension.

"bernie sanders rises in the senate, prepares to become trumps worst nightmare tweets  addicting info  the knowledge you crave on november 16, 2016 456 pm  
it was just a few days ago that bernie sanders responded to trumps election win with the perfect message from democrats. he said  
if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims, hispanics, african americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare. 
and from what was just announced, it seems that sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. earlier today, the vermont senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door senate democrat caucus meeting, according to the hill . in his new role, sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters  the very voters who became trump supporters this year. sanders will also be the ranking member on the senate budget committee. acknowledging that he has a heavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the united states government, sanders said im going to do everything that i can to make sure that the budget that leaves the united states congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires. with the announcement of sanders new position, trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. hes spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. by elevating sanders to this new role, democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that sanders presidential campaign and vision for america resonated with many voters. as we saw with sanders popularity in the primaries, the vermont senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against trump as he takes office. sen. debbie stabenow d-mich. commented on sanders new responsibility we want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. we have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing. sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset trump, as hes been one of the most outspoken politicians on twitter since trumps win twitter twitter twitter 
however, sanders new role is great news for our country, and we know hes going to give trump hell.

"'they live'  possibly the most powerful message in a movie . 'they live'  possibly the most powerful message in a movie they live is a science-fiction movie from the eighties that features aliens, a wwf wrestler and a ... print email  they live is a science-fiction movie from the eighties that features aliens, a wwf wrestler and a whole lot of sunglasses. whats not to like? while, at first glance, the movie appears to be a bunch of nonsense, they live actually communicates a powerful message about the elite and its use of mass media to control the masses. is the movie describing the control of the illuminati over our society? this article looks at the deeper meaning of john carpenters strange but fascinating movie  they live . warning major spoilers ahead get over it, the movie is 24 years old. watching they live is a conflicting experience. it is an odd combination of eye-opening messages with lackluster acting, powerful social commentary with 1950s b-movie special effects and gripping satire with odd punchlines. constantly making viewers oscillate between wow, that was genius! to wow, that was corny!, it is difficult to properly evaluate the movie from a cinematographic point of view. however, from a message point of the view, they live is gold. based on ray nelsons short story eight oclock in the morning, the movie is one of those rare subversive stories that forces viewers to question their world and their surroundings. because, despite the fact that the movie is about ghoulish aliens, it communicates truths to the viewers that are only alluded to in mainstream movies. in fact, looking deeper into the storyline, one might realize that theres probably more science than fiction in the story of they live  especially when one has truth-seeing sunglasses.the hero of the movie, played by wwf wrestler rowdy roddy pipper, is a drifter that is apparently nameless. in the short story and the movies credits, he is referred to as nada, which means nothing in spanish. while this nameless nothing is broke and homeless, he still manages to expose the aliens hidden rule of the world. how did he accomplish that? with the only thing hed ever need the truth. oh, and also guns. he used a lot of guns. most importantly, despite the fact that nada was tempted several times to shut up in exchange for generous compensation, he kept his integrity and never agreed to sell out to the aliens. now, thats a role model. to top it off, he says the best things ever. im here to kick ass and chew bubble gum  and im all out of bubble gum. are the aliens in the movie an imaginative way to portray the worlds elite , those who secretly run the world, those we call the illuminati? lets revisit this cult classic and see how it describes the hidden rule of the elite. the premise right from the beginning, as we see nada walking around los angeles with his backpack, the movie sets a particular mood something is not quite right. while nada appears to be a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, the city is not happy and it is not too kind to happy-go-lucky kind of guys.quite the contrary, there is a sense of impending doom in the air poverty is rampant, helicopters fly around the city and street preachers speak of soulless beings ruling the world. the venom of snakes is under their lips. their mouths are full of bitterness and curses. and in their paths, nothing but ruin and misery. and the fear of god is not before their eyes! they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders. they have recruited the rich and powerful, and they have blinded us to the truth! and our human spirit is corrupted. why do we worship greed? because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us from birth to death are our owners. our owners  they have us. they control us. they are our masters. wake up. theyre all about you, all around you!. is the preachers description of the masters applicable to the illuminati? i believe so.as we follow nadas aimless drifting across the city, the camera often focuses on people gazing blankly at television screens, mindlessly absorbing the vapid messages it communicates. regular joes appear to truly enjoy their television shows  until an obscure organization hacks the airwaves to broadcast subversive messages about the hidden rulers of the world. our impulses are being redirected. we are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.  the poor and the underclass are growing. racial justice and human rights are nonexistent. they have created a repressive society, and we are their unwitting accomplices. their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness. we have been lulled into a trance. they have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others. we are focused only on our own gain. please understand. they are safe as long as they are not discovered. that is their primary method of survival. keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated. can the above statement be applied to those in power? i believe so.the average joes who watch this pirated tv broadcast all get a massive headache  the raw truth is indeed too much for most people to bear. one such viewer switches the channel after telling the guy on tv blow it out your ass. just like today, most people do not want to hear about this kind of stuff  they just want to go back to their mindless tv viewing.nada realizes that the street preacher and the man on television are connected through a local church. when he sneaks into the church, he discovers that it is actually the headquarters of an underground organization.on a wall inside the church is written they live we sleep, a phrase that describes the fundamental difference between the elite and the masses. those in power know the truth about the world and possess the means and the power to truly live.the rest of the population is sedated, dumbed-down and manipulated into a zombie-like status in order for it to be as easily manageable as possible by the masters. the masses ignorance equals a state of endless slumber.nada learns that the rebellious organization is attempting to recruit people to take down the rulers. however, a few days later, nada discovers what happens to those who plot against those in power.helicopters, bulldozers and police in riot gear raid the place, destroy everything and violently arrest the members of the underground organization. that is how the elite responds to contrary views.after witnessing the violent police shakedown , nada begins to realize that something is wrong in america. the happy-go-lucky guy who believed in working hard and following the rules is starting to believe that something is amiss here.determined to learn more, nada re-enters the church and finds a few interesting things.the police painted over they live we sleep. obviously, they dont want that message to be known .more importantly, nada discovers a box full of sunglasses that allows his to see the world as it is. added bonus they also look pretty cool. seeing the truth while the sunglasses found by nada appear on the surface to be worthless, they actually provide him with the greatest gift of all the truth. when nada first puts on the sunglasses, the experience is shocking.when he has his sunglasses on, nada sees through the smoke and mirrors projected by advertisement and mass media . he only sees the core of their message and the only reason why they exist.no matter which magazine nada flips open, he sees the same subliminal messages, which tells a lot about the true function of celebrity and fashion magazines.despite the fact that they are all different, they all ultimately serve the same purpose to reinforce messages from the elite to the masses. nada also quickly understands the truth about money . in god we trust? some people are not human . they are from another race that has infiltrated society. nada realizes that they are everywhere and that they hold positions of power, like this politician giving a typical politician speech on television. is this a way to portray the illuminati, or something much-much deeper ?upon discovering this truth, nada became pissed off. really pissed off. how did he react to the situation? he did not go home and write a poem about it. nope, he grabbed a shotgun and started shooting aliens.when the aliens realize that nada can see through their disguise, they immediately alert the authorities saying ive got one that can see. being able to see is obviously frowned upon by the aliens  they do not like to be exposed. nada quickly becomes a social pariah and aliens start closing in on him. confronted with this situation, nada says profound and timeless words i dont like this ne bit.many aliens are part of the police force as its sole purpose is to ensure that the aliens rule is not disturbed. most policemen are however regular humans and just follow the orders because thats their job  a little like actual policemen who do the illuminatis work.nada and everyone in the city are constantly monitored by flying surveillance cameras that are oddly similar to the new unmanned drones that are currently appearing around the world.flying surveillance cameras were considered science fiction in 1988. they are reality today.an actual, modern unmanned drone mounted with a video camera.the concept of truth-seeing sunglasses is an interesting way to illustrate the importance of knowledge in ones world perception. two people can be looking at the exact same thing yet perceive two very different realities, depending on the level of information and awareness possessed by each person. nadas sunglasses can therefore represent ones knowledge of the truth, which allows a clear perception of reality. looking for others who know the truth upon learning the shocking truth about the world, nada feels the need to share this vital information with his friend frank armitage. nada however quickly realizes some people do not want to hear about it. in fact, many actually get angry and offended at the simple mention of something that alludes to it. when nada asks frank to put on his sunglasses so he can see what he sees, frank firmly refuses and calls him a crazy motha.nada replies with another classic line either you put these sunglasses on or start eating that trash can.then ensues one of the longest one-on-one fight scene i ever seen eight minutes of punching and kicking, a scene that is dragged out for so long that it becomes utterly absurd and even comical. while the scene maybe appear ridiculous, it says something about the difficulty of making regular, average people wake up from their blissful ignorance.frank finally sees the truth. all it took is nada beating the crap out of him, sticking the sunglasses on his face against his will and forcing him to look around. yes, convincing other people of the truth can be a hard task.it takes a lot of effort on nadas part, but frank finally sees the aliens controlling the world. the two pals are then invited to a secret meeting of the underground organization that is attempting to rid the earth from the aliens.during the meeting, nada and frank are given truth-seeing contact lenses. the sunglasses gave truth-seers a nasty headache, especially when they are taken off. when first exposed to the truth, adapting to the new reality can indeed be difficult, and even painful. however, after a while, it becomes seamless part of the person. a little like wearing contact lenses.during the meeting, nada and frank learn that humans are being recruited by the aliens in exchange for wealth and power. as the leader of the underground organization says most of us just sell out right away. it is rather easy to make a correlation between the movie and actual politicians and celebrities weve seen in previous articles on this site who readily sell out to the illuminati in exchange for wealth, power and celebrity.the meeting doesnt last long, however, as police barge in the place and start shooting everyone there. they are designated a terrorist organization by the elite. nada and frank manage to escape and accidentally find themselves behind enemy lines, in the aliens underground base. behind enemy lines while exploring the aliens underground base, nada and frank stumble upon a party thrown by the aliens for human collaborators to thank them for their partnership. although humans will never be considered equals to the aliens, those who sell out to them get monetary benefits  much like those who are not part of todays elite who nevertheless sell out to push the elites new world order agenda . our projections show that by the year 2025, not only america but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance. the gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite. frank and nada then discover the source of the aliens brainwashing signals a television studio. the aliens use the network to broadcast hypnotic and subliminal signals to humans, blinding them from the truth about their rulers and the world. the message that is communicated here mass media is the elites favorite tool indoctrinate the masses and to keep them in servitude. the tv station cable 54 is used by the aliens to hypnotize humans. is this science-fiction? barely. nada realizes that the only way to save humanity from the grips of the aliens is to go to the roof of the tv stations building and to take down the emitter of the subliminal messages, disguised as a satellite dish. indeed, without an elite-controlled mass media, indoctrinating the masses will be a lot more difficult. so nada and frank start shooting their way towards the roof, not an easy task. the disinformation agent while this lady appeared to be nice at first, she tried to mislead, deceive and even kill nada during his quest. she ends up shooting his pal frank in the head.nada met holly thomspon, a cable 54 network executive, at the beginning of his wild rampage. while nada appears to be somewhat enamoured with her, she always somehow brings trouble. during the terrorist organization meeting, holly infiltrated the group, posing as a sympathizer and claiming that cable 54 was clean and was not the source of aliens signal, which was false and misleading. today, disinformation is widely used by the elite to confuse and mislead those who attempt to discover the truth about the world.during nadas rush towards the roof of the networks building, holly appears again, claiming that she wants to help him. however, she is simply trying to kill him before the mission is accomplished. she is therefore another human that sold out to the aliens being used to disrupt non-corrupted humans attempting to liberate themselves and others. taking down the aliens heres the biggest spoiler of them all nada manages to take down the aliens transmitter and saves humanity. this heroic move gets him killed, however, as a policeman inside a helicopter shoots him dead. nada therefore becomes the quintessential hero, sacrificing his life for the good of humanity  a martyr for human freedom from soulless rulers .even though it cost his life, nada visibly does not regret exposing the aliens to the world. with his last once of strength, nada gives the aliens a uniquely human parting gift the finger.tv viewers around the world now realize that those giving the daily news were also those who controlled them. in conclusion although they live is usually described as a science-fiction movie that criticizes consumer culture, the scope of its message actually goes way beyond the usual consumerism is bad lecture. they live can indeed be interpreted as a treatise on the thorough and systematic conditioning of human experience in order for a hidden elite to covertly control, manipulate and exploit the masses. in the movie, the rulers are portrayed as a completely different race that perceives humans as inferior  something that can easily be correlated to the attitudes about the bloodlines of the illuminati. the presence of these strong messages in the movie is one of the reasons they live became somewhat of a cult-classic, despite the fact that it was panned by movie critics. as the years go by, the movies message is becoming increasingly relevant  and freakishly realistic.many of those who seek the truth about the world realize that its reins are held by an un-elected elite, one that is essentially hidden from the public eye. as the movies promotional poster says you see them on the street. you watch them on tv. you might even vote for one this fall. you think theyre people just like you. youre wrong. dead wrong. working behind the scenes, this secretive elite constantly works towards the creation of a global system that would serve its interests a new world order , ruled by one world government. as a human collaborator says in the movie to justify his selling-out there aint no countries anymore. no more good guys. theyre running the whole show. they own everything. the whole goddamn planet! to facilitate the rulers work, the masses are kept in the dark and are distracted with the fake puppet show that is politics and the no independent thought programming that is mass media . apathy, ignorance and indifference are the elites best friends.despite its unimpressive special effects and odd dialogue, they live manages to describe the world elites motives and strategy in a way that can be understood by all. and that is no simple task. however, in order to fully understand the movies message, one must be wearing truth-seeing sunglasses. do you have yours on? reference   they live is available on amazon. dear friends, humansarefree is and will always be free to access and use. if you appreciate my work, please help me continue.

"reason of why the fbi reopened clinton investigation decoded some of you may wonder and ask yourselves why has the fbi reopened the the clinton email case. anthony weiner is just the surface reason.
fbi director james comey saw the mutiny within the fbi with many fbi agents revolting over his decision not to prosecute hillary clinton back in july 2016.
so heres the bombshell comey decided to reopen hillarys email investigation because he is fearing that he will get arrested and put behind bars for corruption and collusion in case donald trump wins.
he reopened the case, to create an escape route in case trump wins. its quite simple actually. james comey did not provide any recent proof he stumbled upon and neither will he until the election is over. yes hes technically not allowed to but he could just indict hillary in a second if he truly wanted just for lying to the fbi or wiping the server to get rid of all the evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena.
so if hillary clinton wins, comey will simply close the case and declare that nothing was substantial after all and she dust made a mistake, just like he did before.
if donald trump wins, he will finalize the investigation and put hillary clinton behind bars, then he will tell donald trump see? i was fair and i wasnt corrupt! i did arrest her after all and i did my job! hoping to get away with what he did during the first investigation.
make no mistake about it, this isnt coincidence, comey surely fears trumps retribution, the decision to reopen the investigation came just 1 single day after trump called the fbi corrupt and called for a reopening of the investigation, see for yourself .
trump is pretty tolerant guy so this may actually work out for comey. he wrongfully forgave many people! for example, after having an conflict with paul ryan refusing to endorse trump back in the primaries, trump finally decided to forgive ryan and endorse him right before the wisconsin congress elections. if trump wasnt soft regarding some of those traitors, he would have endorsed paul nehlen instead but he didnt and it was a mistake as we now know.
comey however will have to look authentic though and he will have to prove to trump before the elections that he is truly on to something and that this isnt just a political move. dont expect for comey to go to hard because hes well aware that if he goes too hard on queen of the underworld hillary and she wins, then he will rot in jail for the rest of his life because hillary is the revengeful type.
just to prove the case that she is revengeful, look at what she did after trump slammed bill clinton as a rapist during the 2nd debate. before the 3rd debate even started, she paid a couple of skanks to go out and publically lie, falsely accuse trump of raping and groping them. during the 2nd debate she was looking at trump with hatred while he was speaking and she was looking like she was thinking to herself things similar to this ohh yeah? fk you! wait till you see what ill do to you next time! youre gonna regret this! and yes she was even seen on live tv telling trump fk you! during the 2nd debate . hillary was infuriated because trump brought bills rape victims up during that debate, but most people didnt catch it! she was clearly infuriated and already plotting revenge in her mind.
so with that said, dont expect hillary clinton to get indicted before the election. its not gonna happen. comey is a weasel appointed by obama. basically hes a democrat. the funny thing is that even though hes a democrat in disguise, fellow democrats are already calling comey traitor, russian agent and putin puppet on twitter . everyone who disagrees with them must be a russian agent these days. they really love their conspiracy theories. after all isnt john podesta interested in aliens, ufos and area 51? you cant make this stuff up. really funny stuff to watch those crazy liberals going full psycho.
but even if comey is playing on the safe side with both candidates, hillary would definitely sink her fangs into his neck for reopening the case, should she win. even if he does nothing and just closes the case after a hillary victory, she would still take her revenge. its in her character, shes revengeful and besides its a classic mafia tactic, leave no traitor alive or among your ranks. she would at the very least replace him.
additionally comey wanted to calm down an fbi which was facing a full pitchfork revolution from within with many agents being angered by this. jill mccabe, the wife of the fbi deputy director andrew mccabe who investigated hillary clinton, received a 675.000 donation bribe from hillary clinton. the agents were angry. so this move to reopen the case was also strategic with his agents. it will calm the waters down for a while. if hillary wins he will just tell the agents to go f themselves and look for a another job if they dont like it, if trump wins and comey indicts hillary after the election, the other agents will be pleased.
hillary probably has something on comey on which she could blackmail him with but it wont matter because if he will do his job and arrest hillary shortly after the election, trump will be pleased and keep him on as the director.
james comey would prefer hillary to win though because thats why he didnt indict her during the first investigation, but hes gotta defend his ass by preparing for a different scenario, like a trump victory so thats exactly why he reopened the investigation now.
trump will win in a landslide and comey will most likely be fine should he prove himself worthy before the election and actually do something.
expect more of those two-faced people to come out and do the same in the next days. expect event he likes of cnn, new york times to stop bashing trump as everyone will have to prepare for the possibility of a trump victory, out of fear of a huge retribution in case they dont change. remember those libel laws cnn?",62,736267,fake

"how the elites are using divide and rule to control us it wasnt long ago that the left represented the anti-establishment wing in politics. they used to fight against globalism remember the anti-globalization movement? even if their motives were different from those of todays anti-globalists, as well as being against censorship, imperialist wars, and the expanding powers of governments and corporations. but today, you see leftists protesting against brexit, attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee, and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians. so, just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites?

to understand, we must go back to 2011 when the occupy movement was ongoing. the occupy protests, which now seem like ages ago, came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system. we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them, but the important fact is that, to the elites, it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power.
the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in post-war history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule. so, the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a full-blown revolution. and they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule.
the diversion 
when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed, the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere. the people want to vent out their frustrations. the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up, so instead of fighting it, they prefer to re-channel that pent up energy elsewhere.
on february 2012, with the occupy movement still raging, the elites were given that golden opportunityor, rather, they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in florida the none other than the infamous trayvon martin case. the shooter wasnt even a full white, but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it; anything to divert the public attention away from them. with their efforts, it quickly became the biggest story of america.
but they didnt stop there. police shootings, which have always been happening and to all races, were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movementa movement that is financed by george soros and others to stir up unrests across america.
did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies?
the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the 1 who were dictating their lives. the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere. although i dont have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement, i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order.
the strategy 
back in 19th century, karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism. if we were to apply this concept to the world today, the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites.
the goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power. meanwhile, they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans. the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one, so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible.
my understanding of their modus operandi is this 1 use hot-button issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage, race issues, and all other politically correct nonsense. 2 have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right. 3 let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats. 4 when the issue fades away, foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process. by cycling through them over and over again, the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them.
thus, we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites, women against men, islam and atheism against christianity, left against right, and so on, but no more anti-globalization, tea party movement, or occupy wall street.
as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists, sexists, and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate, socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government, nothing will change. as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant, and getting in the way of creating a decent society, the people will remain divided. as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals, the latest misogynist outrage, or how a lion named cecil got shot, the elites will continue to win.
a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army, but theres nothing to be alarmed about. theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists.
first, while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites, lets not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either. remember how neo-cons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism? the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmds and saddamal-queda link. while the right has changed a lot since then, there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with russia because usa! usa! usa! .
second, it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule, it is not the end of it. the elites have far more sinister aims. by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism, the elites are preparing for a total social control. i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control.
no matter their differences, when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder, theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security. europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens . a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police . while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism, it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future.
the culture wars necessary fight or engineered distraction? 
the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways, but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites.
on one hand, we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists, zionists , bankers, mega-corporations , and the governments from undermining our existence. really, do the issues of politically-incorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middle-class is being destroyed, revelations of massive corruption in the dnc, the coming police-state, and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world? all the drama of outrage and counter-outrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape.
on the other hand, culture does matter in many ways. uncontrolled immigration, anti-male laws, and censorship are all very relevant issues. and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment, the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model i described above. in a way, we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites.
so, does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us? or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their sjw drones? i dont have a good answer, but whatever we choose to do, i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on. we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind.
conclusion is there still hope? 
although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization, the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment. to me, that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class.
with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps, the only anti-establishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump. this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters.
i have my doubts about trump , but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected. but besides voting, i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us. we cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us; we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny.

"what was the halloween death smog disaster? and other scary questions and answers about fluoridation license dmca 
1. why do some people object to water fluoridation? doesn't fluoride occur in the water naturally anyway? 
the fluoride products used in water fluoridation sodium fluoride or fluorosilicic acid are classified as hazardous waste products of the fertilizer, aluminum, and nuclear industries. they are even more toxic than naturally-occurring fluoride, since they contain other components, such as arsenic and lead. 
however, even naturally-occurring fluoride, in areas with high concentrations over 1 ppm have been found to have extremely adverse health effects. even before additional fluoride is added, the level of natural fluoride in the water in many areas in the u.s. is already equal to the amount of naturally-occurring fluoride that has been found to cause skeletal fluorosis in other countries. studies done in india and china found skeletal fluorosis in areas containing naturally occurring fluoride as low as .07 ppm. gupta r, kumar an, bandhu s, gupta s. 2007 skeletal fluorosis mimicking seronegative arthritis. scandanavian journal of rheumatology 362154-5. that same amount, .07 pmm is the current amount recommended by the cdc to be added to community water supplies. 
in addition to the natural fluoride in groundwater, most people are exposed to multiple sources of fluoride pesticides in wine and food, tea, some ceramics, anti-depressants, pollution from manufacturing, soft drinks, teflon pans, toothpaste etc.. they presumably are being exposed to well over the equivalent of 1 ppm before any fluoride is added to the water, however no industry or government testing has ever been done to find out how much fluoride the public is absorbing from all sources. this massive exposure to fluoride did not exist in the 1950's, when fluoride was first introduced. 
2. don't all advanced countries fluoridate their water? and hasn't it been proven that countries that do fluoridate their water have better dental health than countries that don't? 
no. fluoridation has been almost completely abolished in europe. recently other countries, such as israel and many parts of australia, have discontinued fluoridation. statistics gathered by the world health organization do not show any difference in rates of dental caries in fluoridated vs. non fluoridated countries. who collaborating center for education, training, and research in oral health, malmo univ., sweden, 2012. where fluoridation has been discontinued in communities like canada, the former east germany, cuba and finland, dental decay has not increased but rather has continued to decrease maupome' 2001; kunzel  fischer, 1997, 2000; kunzel 2000; seppa 2000. 
in the u.s., the state of kentucky, which has been fluoridating the longest, and has achieved almost complete fluoridation of its water supply, has the worst dental health of any state in the country. from an article appearing in the lexington herald leader 10142009 ""governor beshear said kentucky led the nation in 2004 in terms of the number of people age 65 or older who had lost teeth. about 27 percent of kentuckians of all ages had lost six or more teeth to decay or gum disease, compared with 18 percent in the rest of the nation."" and yet, in 2004, 99.6 of kentucky's public water systems were providing fluoridated water to their customers. this ranked kentucky first among all states."" kentucky epidemiologic notes and reports, vol. 40. no. 8, dept. of public health. - advertisement - 
similar results were reported in texas ""after 9 years and 3 million of adding fluoride, research shows tooth decay hasn't dropped among the poorest of bexar county's children, it has only increased--up 13 percent this year."" conger j., 2011, san antonio added to our drinking water a chemical 'more toxic than lead? ' kens 5 news. 
for the best article analyzing the research on fluoridation worldwide, see the article by john colquhoun, dds, phd former chief dental officer of auckland, nz why i changed my mind about water fluoridation perspectives in biology and medicine 41 29-44 1997, university of chicago press. colquhoun studied the effects of fluoridation around the world, with the intention of proving how beneficial it was, but discovered, to his astonishment, that people in countries using fluoridation had the worst teeth. he then began crusading to put an end to the practice. 
since 1990, 144 cities have rejected water fluoridation. 
3. where did the idea of fluoridating the water come from? 
industrialists in the aluminum and nuclear industries were under fire because of the harmful effects of the fluoride waste products being emitted from their plants--animals and people were being sickened for miles around. they hired edward bernays, who was the inventor of mass public relations campaigns bernays also happened to be the nephew of sigmund freud to convince the american people that putting toxic waste in our water supply was good for us. - advertisement - 
bernays had organized a successful campaign, on behalf of lucky strike cigarettes, to convince american women that smoking was both glamorous and liberating. he hired models to pose as debutantes in a march for women's rights. when bernays gave the signal, all the women lit up their cigarettes. another successful propaganda campaign that he orchestrated was the overthrow of a democratically-elected government in guatemala on behalf of the united fruit company. the nazis studied and made use of bernays' techniques for their propaganda programs. a more in-depth discussion of bernays' role in the campaign to convince the public to accept fluoridation can be found in the video ""the fluoride deception"" at youtube.com, and the book with the same name by christopher bryson, seven stories press. 
4. ok, so maybe fluoridation hasn't been proven to be effective in improving dental health, but what harm can it do to add it to our water supply? 
first there is the cost factor. at a time when there is no money for schools, dental treatment for kids, support for the homeless and basic community services, counties are spending millions of dollars to fluoridate the water. even worse, fluoridation has been associated with increased rates of kidney disease, alzheimer's, bone cancer, damage to the thyroid, increased bone fractures, hyperactivity, and decreased iq in children. see  . 
although adding hazardous waste to our water is not beneficial to anyone, it is particularly harmful to people with kidney disease who can't excrete it properly, infants when mixed with formula it far exceeds the safe amount of fluoride, farmworkers already exposed to fluoride in pesticides, tea drinkers, people taking anti-depressants, people with low thyroid, and those who have chemical sensitivities. also adversely affected would be people who drink lots of water such as diabetics, athletes, and manual laborers.",127,736267,fake

"hillarys healthcare fix exposed, millions of americans will end up dead share this 
dont be deceived by hillary clintons lie that shell fix obamacare. she already tried to fix healthcare in 1994 when president bill clinton put her in charge of transforming our healthcare and insurance plans. she called it hillarycare, and like obamacare, it failed miserably. now, her plans for obamacare have been exposed  along with how millions of americans will end up dead thanks to her fix. 
hillary clinton is a very dangerous woman. the one thing that scares healthcare professionals is her plans to fix obamacare, which is falling apart with premiums going through the roof. it was always going to fail. 
as a registered nurse for over 20 years, working in the inner city in los angeles, i saw firsthand how health care works. when barack obama and his democratic minions passed obamacare in 2010, i freaked out, knowing this would bring untimely deaths to many of my fellow americans, and now that hillary says shell fix obamacare, i can be silent no more. hillary promises to fix obamacare with full blown socialized medicine 
the first thing you need to realize is that obamacare was never the ultimate plan. it was meant to be a step toward total socialized medicine. hillary will put obamacare on steroids, and the goal is for a complete government controlled system that every american is enrolled in, where that is the only choice you have. 
this is the same system that plagues canada and great britain, and it means americans will die. instead of your doctor deciding what type of care you get, there are strict guidelines which all doctors must follow. if you are a woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you will only be given one path to take. you will not be allowed to find out about cutting edge drugs or treatments. you will be sent home to die. kathleen sebelius said, under obamacare, someone lives and someone dies. 
under socialized medicine, its all about cost effectiveness, and ovarian cancer has a high death rate. so, youre not worth the expensive treatment that may cure you or help you live longer. you wont even know those treatments exist. theyll pat you on the head, say how sorry they are, and tell you that they will do everything they can to keep you comfortable. 
this wont affect the ultra-rich. this will affect the lower and middle class, who cant afford to seek treatment on their own. 
socialized medicine will affect even happy events like having a baby. in keeping with the culture of death that surrounds socialized medicine, heres what happened to one mother in great britain whose baby was born at 22 weeks  an age at which some infants have survived when life-saving measures were used. tracy goodwin watched in horror as they let her baby die. 
forty-six minutes later after he was born, and despite her desperate pleas to midwives for assistance, miss godwins son died as she held him. 
she has since been told that the hospital has a policy not to resuscitate babies born earlier than 24 weeks into pregnancy. via daily mail  tracy goodwin left holds her baby boy, born at 22 weeks right. 
if you need to see a doctor, good luck. in canada, they have to wait 3-4 months just to see their primary care physician. canadians wait on average 35 weeks, or 6 months, to see a specialist after getting a referral, according to the fraser institue . if you have cancer, you could be dead by the time you can see an oncologist. 
this is why most doctors and nurses are fleeing healthcare. we can no longer help our patients the right way, with clear consciences, and those doctors and nurses who support this kind of system are lying to themselves into believing that this system is healthcare. its managed deathcare, and that is what big brother does best. 
whats the answer? donald trump . he will repeal obamacare, and even if he does nothing else, its a win. he is putting healthcare back into the free market where it belongs. what drives insurance prices down? competition  and that is what he will do when he opens up buying healthcare across state lines. 
lastly, a brain surgeon should be paid more than a truck driver, no offense to truck drivers. yet, under socialized medicine, doctors are made to take a salary which is capped. this, in itself, does not give our smartest kids any incentive to become a brain surgeon. making a lot of money drives those interested in medicine to become doctors. its just a fact, and it made our healthcare system the best in the world before obama came along. 
back in 1994, hillary tried to pass socialized medicine called hillarycare, and it failed. now, she is back, promising to fix obamacare with hillarycare, but if you value your loved ones lives, there is only one thing to do. make sure people realize what is at stake in this election. literally, their lives are on the line if donald trump doesnt win.",108,736264,fake

""fue insensato que el acuerdo de parís entrara en vigencia antes de la elección"" del martes, dijo la fuente, que habló bajo condición de anonimato. el acuerdo de parís obtuvo el 4 de noviembre el apoyo necesario para ser puesto en marcha. 
pues, según la fuente, la alternativa es enviar una carta de retiro de la convención de 1992 que está asociada al acuerdo de parís, lo que restaría la participación de estados unidos en ambos en un año, o emitir una orden presidencial que borre la firma de washington del acuerdo sellado en la capital francesa.

"canada and eu sign thoroughly undemocratic ceta trade deal canada and eu sign thoroughly undemocratic ceta trade deal opposition groups note that the deal could still fail legal scrutiny and ratification in europe by nadia prupis 
canada and the european union signed the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta on sunday amid widespread protests against the controversial deal that came back to life after negotiations stalled over objections from wallonia, belgium. 
environmental and democracy groups who opposed the agreement issued cautious statements condemning the signing but noting that ceta was not a done deal. 
this agreement will probably not survive the democratic and legal scrutiny of the ratification process over the coming months. its time for our governments to break rank with corporate lobbyists and redesign a trade policy that respects democracy and promotes the public interest, said shira stanton, trade policy adviser at greenpeace eu. 
ceta now faces a vote in the european parliament and ratification by the parliaments of the eus 28 countries. 
if it passes, ceta would create a legal system that allows corporations to sue governments for perceived loss of profit. that framework will also be put to scrutiny by the european court of justice and the german constitutional court, and if it fails to stand up would invalidate ceta. 
the deal has long been opposed on the grounds that it would harm human rights, democracy, and the climate, among other risks. 
alfred de zayas, the united nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, said in a statement saturday that each country should hold a referendum on signing the deal before doing so, warning that it was a corporate-driven, fundamentally flawed treaty. 
there is a legitimate fear that ceta will dilute environmental standards, food security, and health and labor protection, he said. a treaty that strengthens the position of investors, transnational corporations, and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats. 
global justice now gjn trade and migration campaigner guido tallman tweeted a picture of the massive deal and wrote, heres ceta. any mep planning to vote for it, should be sure to read it first. all of it. so they know what theyre voting for. 
throughout europe this weekend, ceta opponents took to the streets to protest the signing. in london on saturday, many posed outside the european commission office dressed as zombies to symbolize cetas seeming resurrection, urging commissioners to stop ceta rising from the dead. 
in brussels, some protesters broke through a barricade and attempted to storm the european commission building before being dragged away by police. 
gjn executive director nick dearden said saturday , the signing ceremony . . . means that ceta has been brought back from the dead for nowbut it is a ticking time bomb. the wallonia parliament has a promise that they will be able to stop the ratification of ceta when they get a formal vote on it, and unless there are substantial changes, theyand hopefully other parliamentswill use that veto. 
ceta would open up our government to a deluge of court cases by north american multinational corporations and investors, dearden continued. it presents a threat to our ability to protect the environment, to protect the public and to limit the power of big banks. its thoroughly undemocratic and must be stopped.

"new report uncovers secret trump server that repeatedly communicated with russia by sean colarossi on mon, oct 31st, 2016 at 847 pm while the media continues to focus on the clinton email non-story, news about donald trump's ties to russia continues to gain steam. share on twitter print this post 
while the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a non-story  fbi director james comeys vague letter regarding more emails related to hillary clinton  news about donald trumps ties to russia continues to gain steam. 
not only did nbc just report that the fbi is now in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps ex-campaign managers connection to russia, but slate also reported on monday that a trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a russian bank. 
slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the russian cyber attack of the dnc, they stumbled onto something unexpectedly. 
the report 
in late july, one of these scientistswho asked to be referred to as tea leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their datafound what looked like malware emanating from russia. the destination domain had trump in its name, which of course attracted tea leaves attention. but his discovery of the data was pure happenstancea surprising needle in a large haystack of dns lookups on his screen. i have an outlier here that connects to russia in a strange way, he wrote in his notes. he couldnt quite figure it out at first. but what he saw was a bank in moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the trump organization on fifth avenue. 
more data was needed, so he began carefully keeping logs of the trump servers dns activity. as he collected the logs, he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world. six of them began scrutinizing them for clues. 
the researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. the communication wasnt the work of bots. the irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversationconversations that began during office hours in new york and continued during office hours in moscow. it dawned on the researchers that this wasnt an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called alfa bank. 
this news doesnt come out of nowhere. trump has repeatedly praised vladimir putin as a strong leader, all while taking pro-russia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a kremlin wishlist. 
the clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by clinton senior policy adviser jake sullivan 
this secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of trumps ties to russia. it certainly seems the trump organization felt it had something to hide, given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists. 
this line of communication may help explain trumps bizarre adoration of vladimir putin and endorsement of so many pro-kremlin positions throughout this campaign. it raises even more troubling questions in light of russias masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt hillary clintons campaign. we can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between trump and russia as part of their existing probe into russias meddling in our elections. 
trumps pro-russia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence. the more information that comes out, the clearer it is that the republican nominee has connections to russia that he is hiding from voters. 
with just a week until election day, this is the explosive story the media should be focusing on. its critical that the american people know what kind of financial ties a potential president has with an american adversary, especially when that adversary is russia.",133,736269,real

bill still  good morning, im still reporting on 4chan. 
if truepundit is right again, then there are movements of fbi agents tonight that suggest a massive raid happening tomorrow in the dc metro area that may involve arrests and seizure of evidence in the clinton foundation investigation. 
i think i can hear the sound of thousands of computers being scrubbed by bleachbit from leesburg, virginia to bowie, maryland when i walk outside. and if so, then tomorrow a mighty blow for freedom will be struck as the first step towards the restoration of the rule of law is taken. 
but first, this letter from anonymous writing on 4chan making some interesting predictions. 
first of all, what is 4chan? 
see also sr 1318  huma abedin flipped in nypd slimy sex probe  crooked hillary may be involved 
it is a message board that is designed from the ground up to be totally anonymous. users dont even have to pick a username. posts are time sensitive  less time for r-rated discussion threads  more time for g or pg rated ones. so, the reliability of the comments can only be judged by knowledge of the context surrounding the comments. 
i did a story on 4chan on aug. 3, 2016, still report 1091 . since i thought it was true, i ran the story then. now, it no longer seems a bit flaky, because much of it has panned out. 
the particular 4chan thread that pertained to whether or not hillary clinton would not be recommended for indictment by fbi director jim comey was announced by an anonymous fbi analyst. 
now management of the thread has apparently been taken over by anonymous. the previous author may have met his fate at the hands of the conspirators attempting to steal the american election. what follows is the message, dated nov. 3, 2016 004333 
over the next few days many new documents will be released. the contents of these documents will contain evidence of perhaps the largest cover-up in american history. 
before this happens we would like to explain ourselves and answer a few questions you may have. 
until this month, wikileaks and anonymous have worked together building an efficient, detailed, comprehensive set of documents that would be responsible for the incarceration of hillary clinton, bill clinton, and 21 individuals ranging from the dnc, fbi, cia, and clinton foundation. 
these documents will show without a doubt, the evidence of treason, obstruction of justice, election fraud manipulation, and bribery. 
this was intended to be the october surprise. but before the release of these documents, we were contacted by a member of the fbi, as well as another from the cia, and a week later by the nypd. all with information pertaining to something much darker than even we imagine. due to the nature of these leaks, we all work together as efficiently as possible to ensure two objectives 1. that all necessary information would be given to the public in an organized, searchable, manageable way. 2. those who provided us with this information would be able to find safety before these releases were made this concern wasnt without warrant. 
the new leaks being released this week will provide documents in the form of emails pictures and videos. within these will be evidence of bill clinton, as well as, at least, six other government officials, taking part in sexual acts with minors. as well as evidence of human trafficking that also included minors. we believe these pictures and videos were taken for the purpose of political manipulation in order to make sure all participants followed through on a previously agreed agenda. 
these documents were given to us by an american government official when he had come to learn that this crime had been covered up by hillary and her staff through methods including bribery and blackmail. he also told us that due to the restricted access of these documents they would soon know he was the one who released them to us. we were trying to make arrangements for him to exit the country safely, but he was killed before those arrangements could be carried out.

in the latest issue of the edit magazine , the 35-year-old discussed why she doesnt like her two sons watching certain movies. they say that every child learns from their mother  and its ingrained from babyhood, keys said. i get real funky about the classics; i dont like my sons watching the original snow white. its totally sexist, misogynistic  shes cleaning for seven dwarfs. 
the 1937 disney animated film pits the titular white against an evil witch, with a colorful cast of dwarves for her to take care of. the girl on fire singer went on to clarify that its not how white spends her time that bothers her. theres nothing wrong with a woman who chooses to stay at home with her family, its a hard-ass job, but its the way its spoken about, she said.

"british welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims calais deputy mayor british welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims calais deputy mayor british welfare system to blame for migrant crisis, claims calais deputy mayor by 0 151 
a french politician has blamed britain for the crisis in calais, claiming it was the uks welfare system that drove so many migrants to gather in the border town. 
philippe mignonet, the deputy mayor of calais, believes the demolition of the jungle refugee camp will not stop the thousands of migrants from congregating in the french port town in the hope of crossing the english channel. 
read more 
the uk government says it does not want any more migrants but it never expels migrants who get there, mignonet told the daily mail . 
they claim benefits and housing, and all we get is the british-funded wall and fences. 
for mignonet, the 2 million us2.4 million british-funded wall being built around the loading area of the eurotunnel, which allows goods trucks to come from france into britain, is simply not enough. 
what english city would accept a fence and a wall being built by another country on their land? if the british government want to improve matters, they should come and talk to the city of calais, he added. 
mignonet invited prime minister theresa may to visit the town, and even offered to give her a covert ride from the airport. 
i have a car with dark windows, so she doesnt have to be seen, mignonet said. 
calais was once part of england, and we have often worked together in the past. we can work together again. the people of britain made their choice about brexit, and some of those choices mean they will face difficulty, but putting walls and fences up here is not right. 
the wall, which is seen as a blight on the coastal town, could also affect the price of the land once occupied by the jungle camp, which will soon be ready for private development. 
this is at the door of england, and near to the shuttle terminal for trucks, mignonet said. what better place for british businesses to come? tighter border 
the british public appears unmoved by french concerns. a new poll suggests most brits would rather see their borders tightly secured than stay in the single market. 
according to a poll commissioned by itv, 58 percent of brits approve of mays brexit strategy of prioritizing immigration controls over the negotiation of the uks access to the single market. only a quarter were against. 
just over 40 percent of those asked insisted eu trade benefits should be prioritized throughout the divorce. however, a similar sky news poll found the opposite to be the case. 
a breakdown of the data, however, showed twice as many older brits support mays hard brexit and immigration control policies as the younger demographic.

"trump reopening 911, reversing rome, in bid to be greatest american steward? trump reopening 911, reversing rome, in bid to be greatest american steward? by daily bell staff - november 11, 2016 
trump im reopening 911 investigation  first of all, the original 911 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened, trump said  donald trump believes that 911 has not been properly investigated and has promised to find out what really happened when he takes office in january. donald trumps plans for his first 100 days in office are raising eyebrows around the world, but of all the items on his agenda it is the reopening of the 911 investigation that will provide the greatest earthquake for the establishment. -yournewswire 
is new president-to-be donald trump really going to make major moves to roll back globalism? 
weve indicated that one way or another the establishment wished for donald trump to be elected. in our view, they certainly have the power  and we think brexit offers a similar story. 
the idea is that the various military and economic disasters pent-up around the world will be released and blamed on peoples impulse to flee global technocracy. 
in this way the elite takeover of the world continues under the cover of politics. 
this process of inflicting disaster has already begun with the so-called riots taking place in the us. there are certainly reports these riots and general civil unrest are not in all cases genuine. 
one can spot, perhaps, soros funding and even crisis actors. but the idea is to make it clear that populists are bitterly resented by many if not most americans. 
of course, trump has little to do with populism. there is a specific globalist agenda that has been implemented around the world and certainly in america. 
this agenda involves trade deals that drain away american prosperity; too-low interest rates that create inflation, stock markets crashes and ongoing depression; and a variety of rules, regulations and cover ups designed to concentrate power into fewer and fewer hands. 
this agenda is what trump is apparently taking aim at. if he follows through on some of his recent statements and positions we cant imagine the secret rulers of america and the west will be too happy with his ascension. 
911 is at the bottom of much of modern globalist cover-up. it trump reveals the truth about 911, the globalist movement based on in london with tentacles throughout the west will likely collapse or at least become far less powerful. 
more 
trump believes that 911 has not been properly investigated and he plans to get to the bottom of it. first of all, the original 911 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened, trump said.  
the election of donald trump has rocked the establishment and things are only going to get rockier for them during his first term. there is a reason george w. bush didnt vote for trump in the election, leaving the presidential line blank and voting republican down-ballot. 
trump has pledged to investigate 911 in a way it has not been investigated before. for the first time 911 will be investigated by someone who isnt part of the establishment, with skin in the game and plenty to lose. 
of course, despite such reports, there remains considerable skepticism on the net that trump will follow through on a re-investigation of 911. for one thing, his campaign is close to rudy giuliani who helped apparently orchestrate the original cover-up. 
in researching trumps most recent comments on 911, we also find net claims that trumps intentions regarding 911 have been revealed on satire sites and and have not been reported in the mainstream. but in fact there is a growing list of reports affirming his intentions regarding 911, including an article posted at dailystar.co.uk. 
take trump at his word and the 911 re-investigation is only one of numerous ant-globalist moves that trump intends to make. it is emerging he has a long list of globalist rollbacks in mind. 
on his transition website greatagain.gov, trump presents some of them. he wants to significantly cut taxes, cut regulation, push back against the fake climate change movement, get rid of obamacare, build the wall, between the us and mexico and reduce or remove unconstitutional executive orders. 
generally he claims to want to make government less intrusive and destructive. this is certainly not the direction the us government has been traveling for decades and even centuries. 
trump also wants to build up the america military  last seen mislaying 8 trillion. but while he wants to give the us military more funding which it doesnt need he also wants to reduce or eliminate the endless serial wars that the pentagon has been engaging in for the past half-century. 
as a libertarian publication, we can think of a lot more that trump could try to do. he could try to get rid of the federal reserve entirely, close up americas military bases around the world, reduce or remove the federal justice system and its prison system that incarcerates 25 percent of the worlds prison population at any one time. 
while hes at it, he could get rid of laws making drugs illegal and other laws regulating behaviors that benefit no one but americas burgeoning, authoritarian police strucure. 
basically, the closer that trump can bring the country back to its original constitution, the better. freedom produces prosperity and the constitution which wasnt actually needed either at least codified limits on the federal government. 
weve argued regularly for years that individual freedom cannot be gained or regained via the political process. politics inevitably reduce freedom, no matter the intentions of politicians. 
additionally, empires like america are probably impossible to roll back and this has likely never happened in the history of humankind. if trump really means to do what he says he will, and sticks to his word, he will be that rarest of all creatures a politician who keeps his word. 
he will also reintroduce real freedom into america and begin the significant crushing of the globalist conspiracy. again we find all this hard to believe given that globalist control from what we can tell of much of western society and trillions of dollars via the central bank system. intelligence agencies and secret societies also seem to be under globalist control. 
conclusion given the enemies he faces and the challenges he needs to surmount, trump will need to have more courage and determination than we can begin to contemplate. but if he really intends to follow through and manages to make significant difference, he will go down as americas greatest president.",175,736279,fake

"us 800-900 isis probably killed in mosul fighting forces still several kilometers from mosul by jason ditz, october 27, 2016 share this 
adding to the upbeat official assessment of the invasion of mosul, centcom chief gen. joseph votel today told the press that he believes the forces involved have  probably killed about 800-900 isis fighters  in the past week and a half. 
by contrast, votel insisted that only 57 iraqi troops were killed, and another 30 kurdish peshmerga. unmentioned was a us soldier also killed in the fighting, embedded with the peshmerga and killed by a roadside bomb north of mosul. 
it is difficult to get accurate information on isis casualties, and the official figures from iraqi officials are almost always dramatically overstated in an effort to sell the war as a runaway success. there are reasons to be skeptical about the 800-900 figure, however. 
the main reason is that iraqi and kurdish forces are still several kilomters away from the outskirts of mosul, mostly occupying empty villages, and while isis has sent out some forces of skirmishers to slow their advance, it is believed the vast majority of their defensive forces have remained in mosul, gearing up for the eventual attack and setting assorted traps. last 5 posts by jason ditz",17,736265,fake

"comment on multiple ny police departments under investigation for hosting gay sex parties with underage boys by john smith multiple ny police departments under investigation for hosting gay sex parties with underage boys multiple ny police departments under investigation for hosting gay sex parties with underage boys matt agorist november 3, 2016 1 comment 
schenectady, ny  a police officers suspension over an investigation into writing fraudulent checks has prompted a multi-agency investigation into alleged gay sex parties for police officers. while sex parties alone are not criminal, a source close to the investigation said the parties were attended by young boys who were not of legal age to drink or consent to having sex with adults. 
sgt. jonathan e. moore, 35, of the schenectady police department, has been suspended after he and his boyfriend, anthony aubin, 27, were caught at trying to use a fraudulent check to purchase a 92,000 jaguar. aubin was arrested on felony charges for attempting to use the check. 
however, according to a report in the times union, the arrest of aubin, who has a lengthy criminal record and was recently on parole, has triggered a much broader, multi-agency police investigation into allegations that gay officers may have hosted or taken part in sex parties  called breeding parties  that allegedly were attended by teenagers who were not of legal age to drink alcohol or consent to having sex with adults. 
aside from the schenectady police department investigation, the probe has spread to the albany police department as well. as the times reports, other departments may also become involved in the broader investigation, according to a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. 
im not really in a position to say anything about it at this point, albany police chief brendan cox said tuesday. there is a case we are looking into but we are not in a position to even gauge whether or not there is any truth to what has been alleged. 
moore also admitted to using the state-run criminal database for personal reasons to check the background of his boyfriend. 
according to the report, moore told police that he knew aubin had a lengthy criminal record but had no idea the checks were fakes. the 92,000 check was purported to be from a miami law office and the 15,000 check was from a fictitious company on washington avenue in albany, reported the times. 
moore told investigators that aubin moved in with him several months ago and the couple was planning to make a lot of money because they had signed contracts with a connecticut company called bear films to make gay porn movies. 
in a statement on wednesday, schenectady police chief eric clifford said moores involvement in the pornography industry may have violated departmental policies, but he did not mention whether or not the officer will face charges. 
clifford said its not appropriate to have him out on the street working for us. 
after aubin was locked up, he apparently began rolling over on all his other connections in police departments. his allegations have sparked investigations into other officers who may have had unlawful sex with teenage boys. 
police officers having sex with underage victims is, unfortunately, a fairly common practice. police sexual misconduct is so common that more than 1,000 officers have had their licenses revoked in just the last six years for it  nearly half of them involve underage victims. 
according to the report , around 1,000 policemen across the us had their licenses revoked and lost their jobs over the last six years on account of numerous sexual offenses that included rape and possession of child pornography. 
the probe involved examining records from 41 states to see how many police officers licenses were revoked in 2009-2014 and for which offenses. police desertification data was not provided by nine states and the district of columbia. the investigation included examining the records of state and local police, sheriffs deputies, prison guards and school resource officers. however, no federal officers were included in the investigation, meaning that number is likely higher. matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa. this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state. agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world. follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share",184,736271,fake

"awakened humanity awaits fully scripted ending as controversial election day nears in consciousness , government corruption , society , special interests , us news no event in american history if you ask me has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming november 8, 2016 presidential election. face it. this presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. evil and corruption was brought into the light. weve observed what a george soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. we had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the us overthrew with their democracy tactics using special forces, ngos, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters isis, moderate rebels. this time the engineered chaos was happening here in the us. this 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. we have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from parkinsons disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. this is the stuff hollywood films are made of. the list of the insanity goes on and on, right? weve witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and jerry springer show-like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that americans are not looking into the events in aleppo or mosul much less the hillary-dnc- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the us criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. actually, this understates the situation. what really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs hillary and together their campaign the dnc-hillary-soros-moveon.org-michael moore-hollywood-mainstream media complex has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. actually, im understating the situation again. all or most americans awakened or not are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the us presidential elections. the question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? and to answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. they have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. not sure of this? then please research sandy hook or boston bombing events. or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. thats right. while they were staging one event after another, too many americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. too many americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media stories and narratives unless we could prove that the account didnt happen the way mainstream media said it did. in other words, many americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise, we should believe mainstream media. well here we are in october of 2016 and finally though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. no longer can it be considered a conspiracy by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. that said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 us presidential election. will staged  political terrorism , a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the american psyche, be staged as mike adams at natural news is writing about ? will this terrorism or planned event mark the beginning of the end of america? if so, what will happen? how will it all go down? many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy america? the one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many events of the past several years have been scripted and planned. so today i invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in todays events. the fact that they are planned. the notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. they hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. they need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. do you see a pattern here? one consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness think ruling elite and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free, will allow you to see whats coming this november 8th 2016. whats coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. so the real question is, will their operation succeed? looking at the election day ending from a birds-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan theyll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. in this what ill call wait-and-see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. in other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. this ultimately is all we need to know to plan our truth seekers and freedom lovers next move. and our next move should look something like this if you ask me 1- have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones food, water, shelter and other personal needs 2- expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. lets not let one of these traitors including crisis actors and operatives working for the state get away with what they have done. 3- dont rely only on the internet to keep track of developing events. you might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents proof. also download important videos dont assume these videos will always be available on youtube or the internet. remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. the main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed america and humanity. 4- beware of layered psychological operations. question everything you hear and dont discount that some news is designed for you to hear it get it?. unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war. in deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming russian president vladimir putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the clintons, the mainstream media, the dnc and many others. now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge the occult because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. we truth seekers are all in this together. we didnt ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. perhaps we awakened humanity are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. this species we call humans needs some members of its kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. there is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted. we like them will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. what we need to do more than anything else is . pay attention  think ahead just like they do. and so today im thinking ahead. i have plans for both scenarios trump or hillary declared victory. i have plans for no political terrorism and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. in my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the us constitution. this is more important than any presidential election. will a trump victory make this accountability more possible? many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. finally, im reminded of the very last line of the film  the american dream  when the villain asks what do you think this is? and the answer this is america!!. likewise, lets remember, this is america, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the us constitution. will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? that question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. this is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day. submit your review",195,736265,fake

"trump erupts at secret meeting with the press, transition in chaos tweets  addicting info  the knowledge you crave on november 21, 2016 758 pm  
donald trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and hes only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the president-elect. 
on monday, trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. this meeting was particularly important because trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. 
some reporters in attendance were nbcs deborah turness, lester holt and chuck todd; abcs james goldston, george stephanopoulos, david muir and martha raddatz; cbs norah odonnell and charlie rose; fox news bill shine, jack abernethy, jay wallace, suzanne scott; msnbcs phil griffin; and cnns jeff zucker and erin burnett. it was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. 
unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. or, as one person put it , it was like a fcking firing squad. 
trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. according to the new york post , one anonymous source said 
the meeting was a total disaster. the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration, but instead they got a trump-style dressing down. 
this claim was backed up by another person, who said 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
trump kept saying, were in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar, and cnn was network of liars. 
this attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, trump barely let them speak. while this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of trump. he has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. 
americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is twitter twitter twitter 
interestingly enough, trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. she said 
excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.

""because of the sniper fire from the militants, another attempt of the syrian authorities and the russian reconciliation center to evacuate around 40 people from eastern districts of aleppo to safe regions of the city was derailed,"" russian defense ministry spokesman maj. gen. igor konashenkov said on thursday, adding that the incident happened overnight . the general also said that russian and syrian planes have stayed at least 10 kilometers 6.2 miles away from aleppo for nine days, after the sorties were halted on october 18. two days after the strikes ceased, damascus and moscow organized safe passage corridors for those wishing to leave the besieged neighborhoods. six safe routes are now being offered to civilians, while two have been designated for armed rebels. the jihadists, however, refuse to surrender and constantly shell escape routes and government-controlled parts of the city. ""the terrorists continue indiscriminately shelling residential districts of the city with makeshift rocket launchers, blocking the civilians from leaving using the humanitarian corridors,"" the general said. while air raids are suspended, russia continues to facilitate aid deliveries to syria's second largest city. on wednesday, some 15 tons of aid was delivered to residents of aleppo's kurdish-run sheikh maqsood neighborhood, located close to the demarcation line, the russian reconciliation center announced. the nine kilogram 19.8 pound packages included rice, macaroni, and cooking oil. the humanitarian rescue mission was discussed at the un security council meeting earlier on thursday, where the russian envoy accused un teams on the ground of failing to negotiate safe passage for civilians aiming to escape eastern aleppo. in response, the un's under secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, stephen o'brien, blamed the parties involved in the conflict for their failure to provide adequate security guarantees. comment jan egeland, special adviser to un special envoy de mistura, was more honest, simply stating  ""it was very clear today that the russians want to help us,"" jan egeland said after a meeting in geneva on the relief effort in syria. ""they would like to help us get access to east aleppo."" o'brien on the other hand, was moved to american-like heights of pseudo-indignation. egeland added ""the united states and the like-minded pledged to help us in our humanitarian diplomacy with the armed opposition side, which is difficult and which in the case of medical evacuation was not satisfactory . we lost a lot of time because of all of the conditions that were raised also on that side,"" he said. egeland added that ""there simply was too little trust, there simply was too much fear, there were too many misunderstandings, there were too many confusing messages for this very complex and very dangerous operation... to take place."" the icrc also welcomed russia's humanitarian efforts, guaranteeing to do everything possible to protect civilians and evacuate aleppo. comment murad gazdiev continues his on-the-ground reporting from aleppo. in his latest, he speaks to emenour, aleppo's only female taxi driver, about life before the war.",165,736264,fake

"19 men cry rape by iran's top quran reader print saeed toosi, right, and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal, the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping 19 of his students and charged with advocating corruption. 
saeed toosi, 46, winner of the first prize for reading the quran, both internationally and locally, fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi, reported al arabiya. 
in an audio recording, toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and, together with the head of irans judicial authority, had agreed to a cover-up to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime. 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts. the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a much-needed dose of truth about the religion of peace. 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake. one of the victims  a recent first-place winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was 12 while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition. the mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. 
all victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions. 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei, current supreme leader of iran. he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan. last may, toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council, with many of irans top officials in attendance. 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man. 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality, sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture, causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced. the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic. 
according to the reformist amad news, officials held a two-hour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast. the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged. 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani, whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents, defended the regimes handling of the case, london guardian reported. larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story, so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not. 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling, though there will be no public trial. awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation. 
toosi, who has denied the charges against him  calling them total lies meant to discredit irans religious institutions and the ayatollah  is reportedly threatening to release the names of 100 of irans top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children, if the prosecution proceeds.",238,736264,real

in case you were wondering, moving to canada can be quite difficult . it may even take years. to some degree it depends on what profession youre in and how desired the work you do would be to the nation of canada. upon writing this the website still will not load reliably; but in the off chance its running properly by the time you read this ive included a link  here . 
the worlds stock markets have been sent into turmoil at the shocking news that reality tv star donald trump actually pulled off the win. but if youre thinking of moving to canada just because of the impending stock market armageddon, dont bother. its likely that the whole world will go into another recession if trump really scraps the trade deals hes promising to. sort of like a brexit on a much bigger scale. in fact, many are saying that the combined influence of the uks departure from the eu and ours from the majority of our trade relationships might spell a very wide-spread fiscal crisis. 
trump, for one, tried to calm these fears in his victory speech. he said that he plans to deal with everyone fairly. but this is unlikely to work. the market ultimately responds cautiously to change and whether that change is going to be fair or not doesnt really make much difference. trump has promised to do away with the establishment. and thats likely to scare economists. one can only hope that as our new president, he proceeds with the cautious tone he could not find during the campaign. or we could just all move to canada.

whatever happens on november 8, donald trump can claim this achievement his candidacy exposed the fact that the two-party system of democrats and republicans is an illusion. 
what we have in the u.s. instead is a corrupt polity where democrat and republican élites form a single ruling party, as professor emeritus angelo m. codevilla stunningly asserted in 2010. see  americas bipartisan ruling class vs. the people  
the evidence?

as the daily bell observes 
there is only one party pro-war and pro-technocratic corporatist. 
the fundamental mythology of us politics is that the democrats are socialist-oriented and republicans believe in freedom and individual human rights. 
but hillary is corporatist, not socialist. 
important republicans call trumps stances brutal, substantively incoherent, and authoritarian. 
strangely, hillarys actions and statements provide evidence of the very authoritarianism and brutality that trump is being accused of. 
when she and her husband entered the white house, one of the very first things hillary did was fire the staff of the travel office in order to put her own people in place. 
she didnt just fire the staff however, she also tried to get the head of the office, director billy dale, put in jail for embezzlement. he was subsequently found not guilty and hillary herself was investigated for initiating the firings and making false accusations. 
her intimidation and blackmailing of her husbands lovers is well known by this point- and thus her campaigns emphasis on womens rights is ironic to say the least. 
her voting record and statements reveal an individual who is most comfortable with us serial wars abroad, no matter the reason or lack of reasons. 
additional accusations against hillary and her husband include violence and even murder of individuals whose interests diverged from theirs. 
most notably, hillary has been accused of orchestrating the death of deputy white house counsel vince foster. 
none of this seems to register with republicans who are crossing over. 
conclusion whatever else takes place during this federal election, the disintegration of the credibility of the two-party system is perhaps the most important development of all.

"why 'never trumpers' must reconsider while democrats perpetually circle the wagons, republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad. the same holds true for many evangelicals. democrats and secularists count on it. 
and we never disappoint. 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and, finally, settled as a reluctant trumper. i, like any god-fearing father of daughters was, and remain, appalled by donald trumps sordid past, and his 11-year-old vulgar video in which he objectified women. his words are indefensible, and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day. 
still, i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov. 8 in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote, for better or worse, for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov. mike pence. 
regrettably, with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith. pride is an awful thing. we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew 1016. foolishness called faith is just foolishness. 
even so, there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first, those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again! pablum and deride any person who, while not casting judgment upon others, makes, with all sincerity, what they view as the principled decision. the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard. while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity, i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong. 
and then there are the self-righteous, plank-in-the-eye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltiness,sinned against god and compromised their principles, brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity. 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service. in 2014 the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate, stared into the camera with cold, callous eyes, and then both lied about and defended unequivocally. i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov. 8. 
mrs. clintons beloved late-term abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the left-leaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances, not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother. 
during a partial-birth abortion, the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb, leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal. this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion, rather than committing murder. 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors, piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt. next, he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands, inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains, thereby collapsing her skull. 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage. 
this is homicide, plain and simple. hillary clinton supports it. donald trump opposes it. 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch. in my estimation, mrs. clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity. her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner. 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs. clinton and ensure that she is stopped. she must not be elected president. to not vote  or to vote for a non-starter third party candidate, which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs. clinton, still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court. 
its simple math, and its undeniable. the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs. clinton by voting for mr. trump. this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations. 
with its 1973 roe v. wade decision, the u.s. supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder. since then, the battle lines have been drawn. this is war. pro-choicers are the bad guys and pro-lifers, the good guys. it really is that simple  that black and white. its good versus evil. 
history will reflect as much. 
under a president hillary clinton, millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive. under a president donald trump, these millions might live. and yet, even as hillary sharpens her knives, we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth.

"donald trump whines because isis cuts off heads, we should be able to waterboard by hrafnkell haraldsson   924 am ""we cant do waterboarding, its far too tough! were fighting on a different level! we have to be tough...and in some cases pretty vicious""   
donald trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the middle east that he supported, a war brought to us by a republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts. trump is also lying about the facts, which at least brings our countrys middle east ordeal full-circle. 
according to trump, speaking at a rally in new mexico  and youve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie  hillary brought disaster to iraq, syria, libya and every place that she touches. she empowered iran and she unleashed isis by leaving that big vacuum. 
of course, it was republican president george w. bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with iraq, stipulating that america draw down its combat strength. reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in iraq, or a negation of isis, but a second u.s. invasion on top of the rise of isis. 
we want peace through strength, trump told the crowd. we dont want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads. 
well, in fact we did want to be in that war. we invaded iraq, not vice versa. 
trump went on to say, 
drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand. we havent had  this is medieval times. this is medieval times and then we cant do waterboarding, its far too tough! you know, were fighting on a different level! see, were fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious, to be honest with you. pretty vicious, but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country  weve spent 6 trillion in the middle east. 6 trillion. and we couldve rebuilt our country twice. 
never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law; never mind that a 2014 senate intelligence committees report said torture doesnt work; trumps argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him. 
this is trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale, and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means. 
he doesnt, because he cant, prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesnt make us barbarians ourselves. he certainly cant prove, because that senate report says otherwise, that torturing people will win the war. 
the claim of 6 million, by the way, is one trump made last week in charlotte, nc as well, and politifact ruled it half true at the time, saying, 
trump is citing the high-end estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in iraq and afghanistan. yet he is confusing money thats been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. 
the point here is that this is a war begun not by obama and certainly not by hillary clinton, who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so, while trump continued to deny he was ever for it, despite the facts to the contrary. 
when trump says we have to be pretty vicious he is also saying we have to be pretty dishonest, and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as donald trump. 
trump has said he loves war. he has said he likes to be unpredictable. he has asked why we cant use nuclear weapons since we have them. this is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands. 
this is a man who, no matter how much he claims otherwise, does not understand how the world works. and he does not understand that by promoting torture, he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the islamic state, by promising to do precisely what they want him to do.",133,736268,real

broward county is one of the largest swing counties in florida. it would not take much voter fraud there to flip it. 
the voter fraud whistle-blower is a former secretary of elections department employee and she has filled out a sworn affidavit 
you can read the affidavit here. the affidavit by chelsey marie smith accuses broward county officials of filling out blank absentee ballots to officials who she saw filling the ballots out at the supervisor of elections headquarters. smith said she was asked to deliver numerous ballots to a secret locked room where employees were filling out the absentee ballots. at first she was not clear as to what was happening. when she finally clearly saw what was up and reported it, she was terminated and told to never come back! 
after being caught red-handed engaging in voter fraud, broward country fl sec of elections brenda snipes claimed staff were replicating damaged ballots in the locked secret room without official monitors present. yeah, that was a good one brenda! 
according to the whistle-blower, the massive voter fraud went on day after day and included what had to be thousands of ballots. brenda snipes is already under lawsuit for deliberately misprinting absentee ballots! why is she still around?

recently, numerous florida voters have complained that they have not been receiving their absentee ballots. it seems we have found where some are going! how many other counties have a secret locked room!! 
democrats live by an ends justify the means mentality. cheating and stealing is of no issue to them as long as the outcome is the one that they want! voter fraud is entirely legitimate to them. 
update 
fox news reported that the florida gop has also filed a voter fraud lawsuit for illegally opening absentee ballots! 
the state gop alleges that officials in broward county, which includes fort lauderdale, have been opening tens of thousands of vote-by-mail ballots prior to them being cleared for counting. 
chairman blaise ingoglia told shapiro that florida law prescribes that when the supervisor of elections takes in all these ballots, they have to be approved by the canvassing board. 
therefore, the officials have no legal authority to open the ballot envelopes. 
ingoglia said none of the ballots had been approved, so the party will be filing a lawsuit at 9 a.m. et thursday if county officials do not respond to his complaint by close-of-business on wednesday.

"discrimination and condemnation australias war on boat people email 
the boat, along with other means of travel, are often undertaken as matters of freedom. movement keeps one alive in times of peace, and in conflict. the australian government, and those backing its practices, have wished over the years to limit, if not halt such movement altogether. 
since the last decade, extreme measures have been implemented that effectively qualify australian sovereignty while singling out a particular breed of asylum seeker. the former aspect of that policy was specifically undertaken to excise the entire mainland from being qualified as territorially valid to arrive in. 
the entire policy effectively assumed a military character, most conspicuously under the abbott governments embrace of a creepily crypto-fascist border protection force, equipped with uniforms and patriotic purpose. operation sovereign borders effectively meant that the refugee and asylum seeker were fair game  not to be processed and settled equitably with a minimum of fuss, but to be repelled, their boats towed back to indonesia, and people smugglers bribed. 
an entire intelligence-security complex has also been created, fed by private contractors and held in place by the promise of a two-year prison sentence for entrusted officials in possession of protected information. 
such statements as those made today by prime minister turnbull, announced with note of grave urgency at a press conference, tend to resemble a typical pattern in australian politics since the howard years. 
the borders, even if supposedly secure, are deemed to be in a permanent state of siege, forever battered by potential invaders keen to swindle parliament and the australian people. yes, boasted the abbott, and now turnbull government, the boats laden with desperate human cargo have stopped coming. yes, all is well on the sea lanes in terms of repelling such unwanted arrivals. but for all of this, the island continent is being assaulted by characters of will, those keen to avail themselves of desperate people and their desire for a secure, safe haven. 
the policy has also received international attention from such establishment institutions as the new york times. while that arrangement, went an editorial this month, largely stopped the flow of boats packed with people that set off from indonesia weekly, it has landed these refugees  many from iran, myanmar, iraq and afghanistan  in what amounts to cruel and indefinite detention. 
as the editorial continued to observe, this policy costs australian taxpayers a staggering us419,000 per detainee a year and has made a nation that has historically welcomed immigrants a violator of international law. 
while this obscenity has been powdered and perfumed as humanitarian, designed to halt the spate of drowning cases at sea, the latest announcements have abandoned the stance. they must know, claimed prime minister malcolm turnbull, that the door to australia is closed to those who seek to come here by boat with a people smuggler. 
finally, an honest statement twinning two perceived demons in australian refugee policy the people smuggler and the asylum seeker, both equivalently horrible to australian authorities. to that end, not a single asylum seeker arriving by boat will be permitted to settle in australia. this policy will also affect arrivals from july 2013. 
such a stance of finality seems little different to pervious ones made by abbotts predecessor, kevin rudd. what is troubling about it is the element of monomania never will any asylum seeker, who had arrived after a certain date, will be permitted to settle in australia. 
the intention there is to make sure that those designated refugees on manus island and nauru, facilitated by australias draconian offshore regime, will have the doors shut, effectively ensuring a more prolonged, torturous confinement. absurdly, they will then be permitted to slum away indefinitely in such indigent places as nauru, with a population hostile to those from the middle east and africa. 
turnbulls stance may also suggest a degree of desperation. not all has gone swimmingly with the offshore detention complex. the png supreme court rendered an aspect of the australian refugee policy redundant in finding that detaining individuals indefinitely on manus island breached constitutional rights. 
peter dutton, the hapless minister for immigration, has struggled in managing what can only be described by the border security obsessives as an administrative disaster. rather than admitting to the realities that searching for refuge over dangerous routes will always find a market, the australian government persists in a cruel delusion that continues to deny international refugee law while punishing the victims.",39,736268,fake

a new gallup poll shows that respect for the police has hit its highest point in almost 50 years.

the 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. the 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of americans lacking confidence in their police officers, at 18 percent.
the increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites, gallup reported in analyzing its results.
the sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive  both politically and for their lives while they are on duty  amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings, it added.
gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.
its unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer, it wrote.

"loretta lynch takes on 'killer cops' -- except in d.c. print 
have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own? 
for the federal government, its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. 
you will recall, of course, how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. 
now loretta lynch, his successor, also known as hillary clintons guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington. 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians, she reported this month. 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations, lynch said. in the days ahead, the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve. 
the irony here is thick, indeed. 
one of lynchs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. 
meanwhile, lynch presides over the most egregious cover-up of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital. 
lynch wants reports? 
so does wnd, which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey. unfortunately, lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the 92-page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation. this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have, based on the evidence. why officers used deadly force. whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave., maryland ave. and 2nd street. only stills have been released. video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger, as doj claimed, when he fired fatal shot to careys head. not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer, as the doj claimed. police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey, two from the capitol police and two from the secret service. not one statement from those officers was in the report. their names were also redacted. redacted information an attorney in the washington, d.c., mayors office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. it turned out much more was redacted than names. the report was riddled with blacked-out sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. some of the blacked-out pages just included a heading marked evidence. some just had a date. witness statements an astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. the police report stated there were seventy-two 72 witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings. copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review. copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad. of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to wnd, leaving 38 missing. statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk. white house guard post video stills were released but not the video. it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up; whether she tried to drive around the off-duty guard who dragged a gate in front of her; and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material. also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters. ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. 
i could go on and on. for people who want facts and reports, the u.s. justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. 
weve been at this for a long time  years. yet the stonewall and cover-up of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that?

israeli troops have razed to the ground at least three houses in the east jerusalem al-quds, in the latest demolition of palestinian property in the occupied territories. 
local media reported that israeli forces demolished the buildings in the neighborhoods of beit hanina and silwan on wednesday without prior notice, displacing at least 44 palestinians including children. 
the united nations has documented a dramatic rise in demolitions, saying 124 palestinians, including 60 children, were left homeless in the occupied west bank in a single day in april. 
the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha also said in august that a total of 726 palestinian structures had been razed in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem al-quds since january, and that the demolitions had affected 1,020 palestinians. 
the world body noted that there were 533 demolitions and 688 displaced palestinians in the entire 2015, meaning that demolitions so far this year have increased more than 36 percent. this picture taken on march 14, 2011 shows a general view of a construction site in the west bank settlement of modiin illit. photo by ap 
the demolitions have raised alarm among diplomats and human rights groups over tel aviv's sustained violation of international law. the demolished structures include houses and schools. 
the israeli razing of palestinian homes along with its illegal settlement expansion in the occupied palestinian territories have dimmed hopes of any peace in the region. 
over half a million israelis live in more than 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 israeli occupation of the west bank, including east al-quds. the settlements are considered by the international community as illegal. 
the occupied territories have witnessed increased tensions ever since israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of palestinian worshipers into the al-aqsa mosque compound in east jerusalem al-quds in august 2015. 
nearly 250 palestinians have lost their lives at the hands of israeli forces since the beginning of last october. loading ...",139,736264,fake
"election crossroads socialism or capitalism? election crossroads socialism or capitalism? exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems' 'living wage' proposal published 20 mins ago jane chastain about   archive jane chastain is a southern california-based broadcaster, author and political commentator. despite her present emphasis on politics, jane always will be remembered as the nation's first female tv sportscaster, spending 17 years on the sports beat. jane blogs at janechastain.com. she is a pilot who lives on a private runway. print 
our country is at a crossroads. never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. one road, the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. the other, favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward free-market capitalism. 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. in this system they control the lions share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. in this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. as the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hard-earned money he or she spends. yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the free-market system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. no, it isnt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard. there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around 85,000 a year in some parts of the country. the democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. 
ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. 
unfortunately, this so-called living wage will destroy jobs. it will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness. 
this, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. 
wages have remained flat for far too long, but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes. they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as weve seen in obamacare, there is a large outcry. thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut. 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. our benevolent government will take care of us. they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. and if we dont get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. under president hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. what a country! 
if we dont reach our goals, everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isnt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke? how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses? they never talk about that. 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said, the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money. 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. the other offers a free lunch.

"mike pence is fine with trump sexual assault but offended by voter suppression by sarah jones on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 1208 pm donald trump's republican running mate mike pence has finally found something he's offended by, but it's not donald trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting african americans or mexicans or women or a gold star family. nope. pence is offended by a news report he hasn't read about their voter suppression efforts. share on twitter print this post 
thats offensive to me, that kind of language. its not our operation, indiana governor mike pence said friday morning on msnbcs morning joe . 
yes, donald trumps republican running mate mike pence has finally found something hes offended by, but its not donald trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting african americans or mexicans or women or a gold star family. 
nope. 
did pence read the story? no. but hes offended. so offended. because that kind of language is offensive. not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because its not our operation. 
watch here via msnbcs morning joe  
twice saying he hasnt read the article, pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadnt read, thats offensive to me, that kind of language. its not our operation, pence denied. 
donald trump and i want every american who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. and thats our message, is to tell the american people that this country really belongs to them. that we can have government as good as our people again, but its going to take all of us. 
and you saw donald trump  say that people who havent traditionally voted republican, weve got an agenda to bring our cities back 
pence is twice offended, so super offended 
ive never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thats just not the approach donald trump has taken to this campaign. its not the approach were taking. were reaching out to every american. 
pence then claimed independents and even democrats are breaking for trump. in fact trump and pence are even losing groups that voted for mitt romney in 2012. pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame republicans into voting for them by saying, its time for republicans to come home because trump won the primary. 
mike pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because its just not what i see out there. 
trump also loves to cite what he sees and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist  like videos he claims to have watched. 
this explains why mike pence and donald trump ended up together. it turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the republican establishments efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. both pence and trump dont care a whit about facts. this is more than typical campaign spin, its appalling in context. 
the context is that mike pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womans pssy without her permission, but he is publicly saying hes offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. 
pence didnt even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesnt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. but why would he? 
pence didnt care about any of the groups donald trump insulted  not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. but he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. 
like trump, pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior.

"while americans fight over which clown to elect, russia deployed its largest fleet since the cold war having been subjected to the intellectually insulting shit show of a third and, thankfully, final debate between hillary clinton and donald trump  likely the two most despised candidates in u.s. electoral history  its now imperative americans train their attention to rapidly unfolding events which, by every indication, comprise blaring alarm bells of impending world war. 
via anonhq 

and no, despite scaremongering to the contrary, this war  centered around superpowers russia and the united states  would not inevitably devolve into the hurling of nuclear missiles. in fact, the likelihood of no-holds-barred nuclear war is, at best, negligible  but the odds of unhindered conventional warfare have increased markedly over the past week.
scroll down for video below a senior nato diplomat, who spoke with reuters under condition of anonymity and cited western intelligence, gave the startling assessment wednesday that russia is deploying all of the northern fleet and much of the baltic fleet in the largest surface deployment since the end of the cold war.
this is not a friendly port call. in two weeks, we will see a crescendo of air attacks on aleppo as part of russias strategy to declare victory there.
indeed, russian ally syrian president bashar al-assad eagerly accepted president vladimir putins military assistance in its chaotic and complex conflict, which largely involves u.s.-created and saudi arabia-funded islamic state militants; u.s.-trained and armed moderate rebel terrorists; syrian government forces; and the altogether controversial western-backed, saudi-led coalition. considering the decimation taking place, that assistance is absolutely justifiable.
of course, that farcically simplified explanation requires the contextualization of an intricate web of extenuating circumstances  nearly any one of which could spark a powderkeg.
russian military endeavors in syria have already earned a vow by the u.s. to defend itself  and by logical extension, that would include whichever rebel groups it considers moderate enough not to deserve being targeted. with russia planning an all-in offensive, some analysts have warned, the pentagon could facilely decide to undertake direct defensive measures.
at the heart of the u.s. multi-fronted proxy war with russia sits a highly-propagandized, baseless narrative of russian aggression  a claim thoroughly saturating american political rhetoric to shift both focus and blame from the true substantive aggressor the world over the united states.
save for scanty disagreement from western-centric analysts, this american aggression  marked by an obstinate quest for dominance and control  has us all perilously hurtling for needless war on a global scale.
and needless, if not highly suspect, aptly characterizes the u.s. recent destruction of several strategic radar sites inside yemen following dubious claims the u.s.s. mason had come under missile attack by iran-allied shia houthi rebels. although american politicians and corporate media swiftly proffered those claims as steel truth  even amid a nascent investigation by the pentagon  the department of defenses own preliminary statement cast doubt about veracity.
the initial thoughts is that this attack was aimed at them, dod spokesman capt. jeff davis statedshortly after the purported incident last tuesday.
nonetheless, the belligerent move by the u.s. spurred iran to deploy an entire fleet of military vessels to the same gulf of aden waters from whence the response attack had been launched.
now, despite the abrupt and official military entree into the yemeni war, reuters reported, the pentagon declined to say on monday whether the uss mason destroyer was targeted by multiple inbound missiles fired from yemen on saturday, as initially thought, saying a review was under way to determine what happened.
but the u.s. propaganda machine truly hit a fever pitch today, thanks to an altogether shady exclusive report courtesy of reuters  amplifying an altogether unproven claim iran has been directly supplying houthi rebels with missiles, arms, and cash.
in fact an unsurprisingly unnamed and unverifiable senior u.s. administration official delivered an accusation of potentially staggering consequence, telling reuters
we have been concerned about the recent flow of weapons from iran into yemen and have conveyed those concerns to those who maintain relations with the houthis, including the omani government.
oman, of course, flatly denies such allegations.
there is no truth to this, omani foreign minister yousef bin alwi told saudi newspaper okaz in an interview last week. no weapons have crossed our border and we are ready to clarify any suspicions if they arise.
in fact, though reuters cites several anonymous diplomats and officials, the accusation iran has been supplying anything directly to the houthis has yet to be unassailably proven  and such reports do little more than proffer a narrative suitable not only to maintain new u.s. military endeavors in yemen, but to recklessly provoke a proxy iranian conflict.
such psychological operations are, of course, not unusual for the united states  and extend to a statement given by president barack obama on tuesday concerning russia.
in a blatant attempt to discredit donald trump for a supposed fondness for putin, obama, as usual, invoked the russian aggression narrative  however, this spiel came complete with a pointedly significant re-characterization about the russian military.
we think that russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage rather than part of the problem, the president explained, surreptitiously upgrading the cold war foes capabilities than its previous status as mere regional power in umpteen previous statements.
this not-at-all-minor point most does effectively two things grows in less cagey american minds the palpability and thus legitimacy of a russian threat, and renews cold war propaganda pitting two global superpowers as mortal enemies  ostensibly setting up a pre-justification to act in even pre-emptive self-defense anywhere on the planet this proxy war plays out.
additionally, in a matter of weeks, disfavor over u.s. actions has cemented military and other alliances between a quickly mounting number of former, longstanding american allies and other traditional western foes  the vast majority of which align with russia.
after a subtly significant geopolitical snub during a meeting of the u.n. security council to negotiate a ceasefire in syria, which infuriated saudi arabia, egypt fomented a friendly military relationship with unsc presiding body, russia.
for the first time, beginning october 15, reuters reported, joint drills between egyptian and russian paratrooper units began in egypt, and will continue through the 26th. further, the growing rift with saudi arabia indicated egypt might have been weighing options for a different ally for some time. reuters wrote
a halt to shipments of saudi fuel to egypt under a 23 billion aid deal shows that a rift between the arab worlds richest country and its most populous may be deeper than previously thought, which could leave egypt desperate for a new sponsor.
egypt hasnt been alone in jumping ship  and the middle east isnt the sole locus of conflict.
during a four-day visit at the invitation of chinese president xi jinping this week  amid deteriorating relations with the united states  philippine president rodrigo duterte asserted it is only china that can help us.
this massive shift in alignment could have highly consequent repercussions in the territorial dispute over the south china sea  another conflict in which the u.s. has embroiled itself in several proxy wars, including russian-backed china.
in fact, although the philippines had been at the center of that quarrel, unnamed chinese officials prior to the ongoing meeting announced china would consider giving filipino fishermen conditional access to disputed waters in the south china sea after the presidents of the two countries meet in beijing this week.
now, following through on intimations the philippines would cleave from the west, duterte just made a historic and stunning announcement today, to an auditorium in beijing packed with over 200 chinese and philippine business people, including chinese vice premier zhang gaoli
in this venue, your honours, in this venue, i announce my separation from the united states. both in military, not maybe social, but economics also. america has lost.
he added, ive realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe i will also go to russia to talk to president vladimir putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world  china, philippines and russia. its the only way.
as another geostrategic and commercial waterway of international importance, the south china seas role in the u.s. proxy war is second only to the red sea and access to it  but the presence of american naval vessels in both those waters and neighboring east china sea has been deemed an aggressive threat by china and its strengthening ally russia, as well as north korea.
joint naval and military drills conducted by the u.s. and ally south korea and the planned installation of the u.s. terminal high altitude area defense, or thaad, missile system along the latters borders inflamed tensions with north korea  who has been testing ballistic missiles for months, much to the consternation of the two nations and ally, japan.
on wednesday, in response to this perceived aggression, north korea issued a severe admonishment to the two countries that even minor signs of aggression would greenlight pyongyang to flatten seoul in a defensive first-strike nuclear attack.
it has been too long a time since our revolutionary armed forces switched to a principle of pre-emptive strike in the conduct of war, in response to the aggressive war provocations of our enemies,pyongyang stated, as cited by upi, ominously adding a ruthless pre-emptive strike is to be applied even in the face of minor signs of aggression.
not known for backing down from delicate situations, u.s. secretary of state john kerry declared its intent to deploy thaad as soon as possible, after meeting with south korean officials in washington, and told the press
let me be clear. any attack on the united states or its allies will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an effective and overwhelming response. we do not, and we will not, accept north korea as a nuclear-armed state.
leaving nothing open to misinterpretation, u.s. secretary of defense ashton carter clarified in a separate press statement that, in defense of seoul, the united states guaranteed full spectrum use of its response capabilities  meaning nuclear missiles are anything but off the table.
shortly afterward, according to nbc news, u.s. strategic command said it had detected what it believed to be a failed missile launch near the northwestern north korean city of kusong. director of the north korean foreign ministrys institute for american studies, lee yong pil, told nbc news pyongyang will absolutely strike first if pyongyang perceives it necessary, saying,
the u.s. has nuclear weapons off our coast, targeting our country, our capital and our dear leader, kim jong un. we will not step back as long as theres a nuclear threat to us from the united states. south korean foreign minister yun byung-se, saying its allies would employ all tools in the toolkit for defense, asserted,
what is most important is to continuously demonstrate our capability and deterrence with our commitment and actions so that pyongyang can feel the panic under their skins. north korea might be known for blustery rhetoric it refuses to back with significant action  but continued provocation by the united states might elicit a response far more detrimental than words.",199,736267,fake
