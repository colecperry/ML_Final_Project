"women everywhere cringe in horror watching donald trump sexually humiliate a woman for revenge by sarah jones on sat, oct 29th, 2016 at 1203 pm donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn. a newly surfaced video via ryan grim shows the trump humiliation game in action, which i walk everyone through from the pov of the woman. share on twitter print this post 
if youre a woman whos worked in any business where youre forced to try to appease the massively sensitive ego of a sexually aggressive, vulgar man in power, you will know exactly whats about to happen in this video. 
donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn. and theres a newly surfaced video via ryan grim at huffington post that shows the trump humiliation game in action. 
in the video, trump publicly sexualizes and shames the 2004 miss universe winner from australia, jennifer hawkins as revenge. before he does it, trump tells the audience, get even with people. if they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. i really believe that. 
watch this newly surfaced 2011 corporate speech here via huffington post major trigger warning if youve been there 
watching this you see the trump modus operandi in action. this is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning trumps advances. the harassment as revenge. the sexual shaming. 
trump sets the audience up for the roman gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should screw people back if they screw you. the sexually angry verb foreshadows whats to come, because he is going to screw jennifer hawkins in public, when she realizes that because its public, she cant further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions. 
trump says hes going to give them an example of his revenge theory, jennifer hawkins. 
trump orders hawkins to the stage. the audience cheers and jeers, delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl. its to be a public spanking. so much fun. 
first of all, how beautiful is jennifer, trump asks, claiming ownership of jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking. the message he can make or break her. she better play nice. 
warning shot, this is about getting even. 
trump tells the audience that he was mad at hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in sydney. he tells the audience how mad he was, and then says, as shes crossing the stage, shes my favorite miss universe. so she thinks maybe this isnt going to be as bad as she fears. 
but then he stabs her publicly for the first time, but i think i like the new one better. 
the audience loves it. he is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnt a good girl. she reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport. 
hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing trump, playing along with his game because she has to, but there will be no easy way out of this one. it wont be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience. she will have to pay. 
i was actually going to get up and tell you that jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but shes not very bright, trump tells the audience, signaling that hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for. 
that wouldnt have been true, but i would have said it anyway, trump proudly tells the audience. this is his alpha male routine, except in real life, the alpha male doesnt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl. but in the mind of little men like trump, this makes him a winner. 
trump points out that hawkins is a big star now, but he helped her make it and then dissed him. he owns her. she must comply or face his wrath. hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him, but trump pushes her away from the microphone. this public shaming will be done from trumps pov only. no need for hawkins to assert her personhood.there will be no defense allowed, because shes already guilty. 
and you know what? she came tonight, she came  came, she came, she came, trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at christmas. he waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming, and they do. they get it. hee heee. so clever. came. knuckles dragging on the floor clever. 
see, so they have the same filthy minds in australia, trump says. 
trump grabs hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her, just like he bragged about doing on the bush tape. 
hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them. the kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek. she is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him, but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact. shes allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him, and pretended to fawn over him as required, but she will not, cannot, allow the kiss. the repulsive kiss. 
im telling this story as i imagine it to be from her point of view, although she has refused to comment. of course she refused to comment, women are told they will be blackballed if they comment. the world is full of men like trump, and they stick together. see roger ailes. women have to play along and appease and if that doesnt work, they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public, especially if they said no in private. 
i can only do this because i have lived it, somewhat like this, in public. and i have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job, while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body. 
from talking to so many women during this election, i know that im not alone. i know that many other women will watch this and know. they will feel the creep of fear and revulsion, the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest. how dare hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce trump. 
and other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it, setting you up to be humiliated even more. they will laugh about it and gossip about it, which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like trump. ironically, if you give in youre not humiliated. its only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object. 
its not just the unwanted kiss, although that is disgusting and assault, much like donald trump bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape. its the public humiliation and denigration. 
its the way the woman is forced, in front of thousands of people, to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge. 
its the way she tries to make it okay, to sweet-smooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire, and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her come and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss. 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people, and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault. its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. 
in fact, this is shades of what trump did to hillary clinton in the stalking debate, after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed.

"first iraqi troops enter mosul, but fighting remains largely in suburbs military goal is to 'liberate' eastern bank of tigris river by jason ditz, october 31, 2016 share this 
iraqs invasion of mosul has entered its third week with a noteworthy first, as the first iraqi special forces entered the city itself in the area around karama district, in the far east. there was fighting reported both within the district and in surrounding suburbs. 
indications are that the vast majority of the fighting in the area remains in the suburbs, with only a small incursion into the city itself. still, iraqi military officials say their goal is to take the whole eastern bank of the tigris river, which divides the city. 
the area entered is near a key industrial site within mosul. it is unclear how well secured this area is from isis perspective, as theyve laid heavy traps and tunneled in around the city in anticipation of the invasion, but indications were that a lot of these defensive measures were taken in residential areas. 
isis is believed to have several thousand fighters in mosul, and with the us announcing they intend to kill anyone who tries to escape, they are likely to resist all the more fiercely, knowing they dont have any place to go after mosul. last 5 posts by jason ditz",17,736269,fake

according to smartmatics website, in less than one year smartmatic tripled sequoias market share and has offered technology and support services to the electoral commissions of 307 counties in 16 states. 
in 2007, smartmatic announced the sale of sequoia, given the difficult climate in the united states marketplace, tainted by a non-stop debate against foreign investment, especially in the election technology area. 
their website includes a flow-chart that describes how the company has contributed to elections in the u.s. from 2006-2015 with 57,000 voting and counting machines deployed and 35 million voters assisted.

"hillary clinton maintains swing state leads as comey email letter flops by jason easley on sun, oct 30th, 2016 at 1052 am republicans hoped that fbi director james comey's letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of trump in arizona. share on twitter print this post 
the cbs news republicans hoped that fbi director james comeys letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of trump in arizona. 
battleground tracker found that by a small margin comeys letter made democrats more likely net 7 to support clinton. 
in the individual battleground states, clinton leads by eight points in pennsylvania 48-40, north carolina 48-45, and in colorado 42-39. the only state of the four polled where trump has a small two point lead in arizona 44-42. 
according to cbs news , and the larger demographic difference defining the race between clinton and donald trump has been a gender gap  slightly larger now than the last time in these states  that offsets a smaller movement of republicans to trump. 
to put it another way, hillary clintons support with women is going up at a larger rate than republican movement towards trump. 
these are the first swing state polls to be taken since fbi director comey released his now infamous letter on friday. the email story isnt moving voters. it is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. democrats are going to vote clinton. republicans are going to vote for trump, and there arent enough undecided voters to swing the election to trump. 
republicans were hoping for a hail mary touchdown to save trump, but clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day. if the comey letter is the big october surprise, it isnt working on voters.

"limbaugh democrats would 'destroy jesus christ' actor jim caviezel portraying jesus in the passion of the christ. 
jesus christ of nazareth is not the republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
but if he were, democrats would try to destroy him in the same manner theyre attacking the 2016 gop candidate, donald trump. 
thats according to radio host rush limbaugh, who hypothesized what this years race would look like if the son of god were at the top of the republican ticket. 
should president trump try to prosecute hillary? sign the hottest petition in america now to show your support! 
it doesnt matter who the republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment trumps getting. it wouldnt have mattered, limbaugh said wednesday. 
they would go out of their way to find ways to destroy jesus christ if he could be nominated as a republican. the democrats would do everything they could, include calling him a liar, the bible a fake book, whatever it took. rush limbaugh 
and despite the fact the bible never indicates jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, limbaugh suggested democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of his offspring 
they would scour the historical record looking for children he had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit jesus. thats who they are. thats what they would do. 
limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that republicans would never escape this kind of media assault based on who we nominate. donald trumps rnc acceptance speech photo screenshot from rnc live feed 
i say this because a lot of you never trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like trump. no, its exactly what you get when you nominate a republican. whenever there is any opposition to the democrats, this is what they do. it doesnt matter. theyre gonna do it. they did it to romney  
ive made this point til i blue in the face. they turned romney, who is mild-mannered mr. gosh, cant even get noticed into the biggest walking satan, el diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick so this is why i think trump has so many people supporting him. hes fighting back against it when most republicans havent and dont. 
as an example of how media treatment of republicans has not changed, limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from cbs. commentator bill moyers characterized the race before it was known that republican ronald reagan would easily defeat democrat jimmy carter. moyers stated 
those of you who might speak spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember, said carter, whos been your friend. and there under the california sun in san diego at a shopping center, ronald reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which hes been a master since his days at eureka college. suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their era signs. reagan took his cue and snapped back, aw, shut up! 
and thousands of supporters roared their approval. those are the people for whom ronald reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. jimmy carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, enoughs enough. 
does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world? limbaugh asked. not an iota!

on the heels of the fbi announcing its renewed investigation into hillary clintons emails, veteran fbi assistant director and wiretap expert james kallstrom is speaking out. in his statements, kallstrom exposes the clintons as being a crime family, adding credence to the long list of allegations against them for unethical and illegal activities throughout the last several decades. hillary and bill clinton sharing a secret, former fbi assistant director james kallstrom inset. 
during an interview with radio host john catsimatidis, former fbi assistant director in charge, new york division, james kallstrom, came forward with some serious statements about the clinton family. according to kallstrom, the fbis original investigation into hillary clintons emails was impeded by the department of justice and other top officials in our government. however, now that the case has been reopened, he is apparently seeing it as an opportunity to add his expert opinion and his own insider knowledge of the situation. 
the hill has provided a partial transcript of kallstroms remarks 
 the clintons, thats a crime family, basically , kallstrom said.  its like organized crime. i mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool . 
 the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation , he said.  thats the problem. they never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, im sure, is loretta lynch would not go along with that . 
 the agents are furious with whats going on, i know that for a fact , he said. 
listen as former fbi asst. director kallstrom speaks about why he supports donald trump as president and explains how he knows that hillary clinton would be a devastating choice to lead america. 
among the many statements he made during the full ten-minute interview , perhaps this one was the most profound 
 its just outrageous how hillary clinton sold her office for money. and shes a pathological liar, and shes always been a liar. and god forbid if we put someone like that in the white house.  
given her extensive and tainted legal and political history, it is truly outrageous that hillary clinton was ever allowed to become the democrat nominee for president to begin with. now, shes under a second federal investigation for wrongdoing while she was serving as our secretary of state, and shockingly, there are still those who support her.

"with donald trump tanking, a trump supporter waves her hillary in a noose doll at rally at a donald trump rally in north carolina, a proud ginger glover waved a lyin hillary doll with a special edition noose on it. 
watch a clip with glover at the wednesday rally here via nbc news  
glover said the noose was her way of making a point that hillary clinton should be incarcerated at the very least, but when asked said she doesnt think clinton should be killed. 
yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around. for effect. 
where is all of the trump rallies violent rhetoric and imagery going? 
donald trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame. 
the washington post did an incredible story on melanie austin, a trump supporter who said trump sees the world like she does. she realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to calm her, after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against president obama. 
the first time she had seen him, at a rally in june, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. at the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. she had gotten them in february, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a rant, a series of online postings that included one saying that obama should be hanged and the white house fumigated and burned to the ground. on her discharge papers, in a box labeled medical problem, a doctor had typed homicidal ideation. 
donald trump and the alt-right, and indeed way too many elected republicans, have already pointed these folks at hillary clinton and barack obama as evil people who must be harmed. when you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone, as trump and his advisers have done suggesting hillary clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad, you are responsible for inciting violence. 
things are not going well for trump supporters, and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the alt-right media and fox news, they smell defeat. 
perhaps thats not connected to this specific woman who brought a hillary clinton doll in a noose to wave at a trump rally last night, but it is a trend were seeing in general  angry trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric. 
there will be more of this, not less, as trumps likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles. 
this is political intimidation that mimics donald trumps despotic promises to jail clinton even though shes been cleared of wrong-doing in all of the relentless republican investigations into her activities as secretary of state. 
of which there will be plenty more, republicans promise us, should she win  because just like the trump camp doesnt want you to vote, republicans only want government to work when theyre not in power. 
the potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among trump supporters.

"6 miracle drugs big pharma now regrets 6 miracle drugs big pharma now regrets with big pharma, first they promote it, then they discover the risks. by martha rosenberg posted on november 1, 2016 by martha rosenberg 
are you depressed? it may have less to do with your mood than your birth control pills, high blood pressure pills, antibiotics or even anti-hair-loss drug, according to new research. new risks have also emerged with popular gastroesophageal reflux disease medicines and even the top-selling painkiller, tylenol. 
there are two reasons the risks associated with popular drugs seem to trail their aggressive promotion. certainly, as millions use brand name drugs, dangerous side effects and adverse events are seen that did not emerge in much smaller clinical trials. who knew? but also, as intrepid report has noted before, dangerous side effects that might be considered major drawbacks to prescribing the drugs often emerge only when drugs have gone off patent and all their profit potential is realized. for both reasons, drug safety activists recommend waiting five years before taking a new druguntil it is not new anymore. 
here are drugs and drug classes that have raised new concerns. 
1. proton pump inhibitors 
one of pharmas most successful gambits has been its proton pump inhibitors ppis like nexium the purple pill and prilosec that reduce stomach acid. to sell the drugs, pharma aggressively raised awareness of gastroesophageal reflux disease or gerd a rare condition which, over time, can change the lining of the esophagus and lead to cancer. actually, most ppi users have simple heartburn. even babies are now given ppis for baby reflux because they spit up 71 times a daya normal occurrence that has been pathologized. 
are addictive. once a patient has taken a ppi for longer than a few weeks, acid hypersecretion can occur on discontinuation, says a recent article in pharmaceutical journal. this causes rebound symptoms, and frequently establishes a vicious cycle of drug reinitiation and long-term continuation. 
clostridium difficile c diff, bone thinning and fractures and vitamin and mineral deficiencies to chronic kidney disease and heart attacks. now there is a new reported risk dementia. 
jama neurology of 73, 679 people 75 or older with no dementia and taking ppis found the patients had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving ppi. other studies have also found a link. 
fluoroquinolone class which includes cipro and levaquin. even as the fda tries to curtail use of antibiotics on the nations farms to make animals grow faster a use which accounts for most u.s. antibiotic sales drug use on the farm is actually increasing. the fdas 2014 summary report on antimicrobials sold or distributed for use in food producing animals reveals that cephalosporin sales increased by 57 percent between 2009 through 2014, sales of antibiotics like clindamycin increased by 150 percent and sales of antibiotics like gentamicin, a dangerous drug class, increased by 36 percent. 
1974, navy recruits were given antibiotics to see if they would gain weight, and after only seven weeks, they did. similar results were seen in children in guatemala and in babies . but making people fat or encouraging antibiotic resistant microbes like mrsa are the least of the risks, it turns out. 
the bacteria in our gut, the microbiome, which antibiotics compromise as they kill the bad bacteria, are responsible for much more than good digestion. antibiotics also affect the brain and influence our mood and temperament, says food expert michael pollan. if you transplant the gut microbiota of relaxed and adventurous mice into the guts of timid and anxious mice they become less stressed and more adventurous. antibiotic-affected microbiomes may also be behind asthma and autoimmune diseases, acn published reports. 

the doctors case against the pill by barbara seaman was published, wisconsin senator gaylord nelson held hearings about clear links between the pill and depression, blood clots and decrease in libido cited nowhere on the label. no women were asked to speak at the hearings, moving alice wolfson, a co-founder of the national womens health network, to say, it must be admitted that women make superb guinea pigs. they dont cost anything, they feed themselves, they clean their own cages, pay for their own pills, and remunerate the clinical observer. we will no longer tolerate intimidation by white-coated gods antiseptically directing our lives. 
fast-forward to this year, when medical studies again c links between birth control pills and depression, especially in young women, and corresponding higher use of antidepressant drugs. 
the risk of depression has been recognized since women were able to get their hands on oral contraceptives, says cindy pearson of the national womens health network. its been reported by women for 50 years. 
sweetening the pill or how we got hooked on hormonal birth control might also be vindicated, writes lara prendergast. the book was called a dishonest anti-pill treatise because the author dared to point out that hormonal contraceptives are ranked by the world health organization as a class-one carcinogen alongside tobacco and asbestos, she writes. 
about propecia, a popular treatment for male pattern baldness linked to disturbing side effects in men including sexual dysfunction and actual reduction in penis size. at the time, propecias label assured users that sexual side effects went away in men who stopped taking propecia; however, the current label warns about sexual dysfunction like erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility andor poor seminal quality that continues after discontinuation of treatment. 
bmj found the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased for users of finasteride 1mg compared with unexposed men with alopecia hair loss, but reports of the disturbing side effects abound in medical j ournals and popular magazines. 
mens journal last year. 
post-finasteride syndrome foundation . 
 johnson to increase warnings in 2014. unintentional acetaminophen overdoses cause as many as 26,000 hospitalizations and 458 deaths per year reported the fda. 
soon after the increased warnings, medical journals linked acetaminophen to birth defects in the children of women the drug such as poor motor development, behavior problems and language delays. a study in jama pediatrics identified an increased occurrence of adhd by the age of seven in children whose mothers took acetaminophen. a study in the international journal of epidemiology found children more likely to have behavior problems and slow motor development by the age of three if their mothers had taken acetaminophen. not all medical voices concur. some said the studies were poorly designed or that fevers , for which the mother presumably took acetaminophen, are responsible for the birth defects. 
in recent years, acetaminophen has been found to have psychological and mental effects not before described. the pain reliever may blunt individuals reactivity to a range of negative stimuli in addition to physical pain, says study. another study found acetaminophen reduced the psychological pain caused by social rejection. 
6. beta blockers 
one out of americans has high blood pressure and beta-blockers like atenolol tenormin, carvedilol coreg, metoprolol, propranolol inderal, sotalol betapace and timolol timoptic which treat the condition have been linked to depression for many years. 
early as 1967, the british medical journal reported that hypertensive patients treated with propranolol for cardiac arrhythmias experienced a rise in the incidence of depression. still, it has not been known if patients depressions were caused by the actual actions of beta blockers like blocking the effects of epinephrineadrenaline and slowing heart rate or mood conditions associated with the diseases for which beta blockers are prescribed such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. 
hypertension found that beta blockers may have a role in the pathogenesis or course of mood disorders and increased hospital admissions for mood disorders. a bidirectional relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease exists, says the study , because of the overlapping pathophysiological processes that underlie both conditions. 
there is a lot of data that depression and cardiovascular disease are related . . . but current hypertensive practices do not consider depression, said the studys lead author sandosh padmanabhan. there could be some people who are predisposed to depression who we should not be giving these drugs.

"democrats may get a 2 for 1 special as trump defeat could take out paul ryan by jason easley on thu, oct 27th, 2016 at 1216 pm rep. paul ryan could be out of a job after the election, as divided house republicans are already plotting to fire their speaker if trump's defeat triggers a big enough loss of house seats. share on twitter print this post 
rep. paul ryan could be out of a job after the election, as divided house republicans are already plotting to fire their speaker if trumps defeat triggers a big enough loss of house seats. 
if democrats pick up 15 house seats or more, speaker ryan is going to have a major problem because his job will be in jeopardy. politico reported that ryans enemies in the house freedom caucus are divided over whether or not to support him. 
conservative house republicans are plotting with one another and openly pining for ryans ouster because he refuses to change the house rules to all more conservative legislation to be passed. the hill is also reporting that conservativehouse republicans are deeply divided on keeping ryan, but donald trump could be the wild card that mobilizing an opposition effort to the speaker, the businessman has repeatedly criticized ryans leadership and was stung after the speaker said he would not longer defend trump after a 2005 tape emerged in which the gop nominee speaks lewdly about groping and kissing women. win or lose on nov. 8, trump could put pressure on house republicans to oppose ryan in a speakership contest. 
ryan is certain to be leading a smaller house majority in january. the size of trumps defeat on election day will help decide how many seats republicans lose. 
eight of the nine house republicans who cast votes against ryan for speaker initially will still be around to vote against him again in january. 
those close to ryan say that he would step down as speaker before getting into a protracted fight with his own party, but the walls are closing in on speaker ryan. 
the damage trump is causing isnt limited to their white house dreams. trump may also cost paul ryan his job as speaker of the house.",133,736264,real
"donald trump is the 45th president of the united states  guardian liberty voice after a long night and a hard election, donald j. trump was elected as the 45th president of the united states. in the early hours of november 9, 2016, hillary clinton conceded the election.
both candidates helped usher in a new political era; she is the first woman to get this far in a presidential election successfully. whereas, trump is the first person to be elected to the highest office in the u.s. who never served in the military and never served in a political capacity.
when the night culminated with trump winning well over the required 270 electoral votes, the election was called. the reality star now holds a new title, president elect donald j. trump.
his presidency will begin with republicans holding the majority in both chambers of congress. president-elect trump will be nominating a new supreme court justice to fill the seat vacated when antonin scalia died in february.
surprising night at the polls on november 8, the polls began to close at 600 p.m. et on the east coast. whereas on the west coast, the polls closed 1100 p.m. there were early projections, which made hearts race. the numbers bounced back and forth in many key swing states. that is until eastern states tallies began to roll in, then the numbers evened out.
polling site glitches many polling sites experienced technical issues. trump attempted early in the day to sue nevada because the polls in clark county remained open for an hour and a half on nov. 7. the judge stated there was no fraud since the states law indicates if a person is in line before the polling site closes, they must be allowed to cast their ballot.
in durham county, n.c., there was a delay beginning the votes, so the democratic party sought to have the time extended to make up for time lost. this was granted, and the polls remained open for 30 of the 45 minutes requested.
donald trump needs to reunite the country commentators on cnn politics agree that the campaign tore through the fabric that makes america great. during the campaigning, citizens became polarized into two drastically divisive and hateful camps.
how is president elect trump going to heal the wounds he inflicted on clintons supporters, the muslim community, latino citizens, and every other group?
during trumps campaign, he threatened to have clinton arrested when he won, build a wall between the u.s. and mexico, close the mosques, and restart stop and search policies. he said he would repeal the affordable care act, and lower the tax ceiling for the richest americans.
his supporters are thrilled, and clintons voters are stunned. there are fear and confusion in the air.
hillary clinton concedes clinton sent out her campaign manager to tell her supporters that it was late and the final tallies were not going to happen soon. she asked them to go home and get some rest. the announcement was made that clinton would speak in the morning.
within an hour, trump told his supporters that she had called him and conceded. the president-elect proffered a simple acceptance. he stated that his was not a campaign but a movement for change.

"184 u.s. generals and admirals endorse trump for commander-in-chief have you seen that pro-hillary tv ad of disgraced gen. john allen? 
nauseating. 
you should know that in 2011, allen, then a 4-star general in the u.s. marine corps, was nominated to be natos supreme allied commander, europe, pending confirmation by the senate. on november 13, 2012, defense secretary leon panetta suspended allens confirmation hearing, pending investigations into the generals inappropriate communication with a woman named jill kelley. gen. john allen l; jill kelley r 
as part of the fallout of the gen. david petraeus -paula broadwell affair, the fbi uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of correspondence  mostly email  between allen and kelley from 2010 to 2012. reportedly, their correspondence was flirtatious and inappropriate as allen and kelley were both married at the time, but not to each other. 
seriously, how can a 4-star general even have so much free time as to write 20,000 to 30,000 emails in the space of two years to anyone? 20,000 emails mean an average of 28 emails a day exchanged between allen and kelley; 30,000 emails mean an average of 42 emails a day. there is no one with whom ive exchanged 28 emails a day, even less 42 emails. 
the upshot not only did john allen lose his confirmation as natos supreme allied commander, he also lost his job as commander of u.s. forces in afghanistan  a post to which he was promoted to replace the disgraced gen. petraeus. see  obama purges u.s. military command part 1  
allen retired from the military in february 2013, but was appointed special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter isil or isis  a post and title created for allen by obama, which allen held for about a year from september 2014 until october 23, 2015. 
allen was a featured speaker at the 2016 democratic national convention in philadelphia. he criticized donald trump and endorsed hillary clinton  who abandoned four americans to die in benghazi  for president. 
like the new yorker that he is, trump fired back, calling allen a failed general. 
trump does have the endorsement of 184 non-failed and non-disgraced u.s. generals and admirals, including at least four 4-star and fourteen 3-star flag officers, as well as the endorsement of 14 medal of honor recipients. 
the endorsements began with an open letter on sept. 6, 2016, from 88 retired u.s. general and admirals  the 2016 election affords the american people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy. as retired senior leaders of americas military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world. for this reason, we support donald trumps candidacy to be our next commander-in-chief. for the past eight years, americas armed forces have been subjected to a series of ill-considered and debilitating budget cuts, policy choices and combat operations that have left the superb men and women in uniform less capable of performing their vital missions in the future than we require them to be. simultaneously, enemies of this country have been emboldened, sensing weakness and irresolution in washington and opportunities for aggression at our expense and that of other freedom-loving nations. in our professional judgment, the combined effect is potentially extremely perilous. that is especially the case if our government persists in the practices that have brought us to this present pass. for this reason, we support donald trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically. we urge our fellow americans to do the same. 
two days later on sept. 8, another 21 retired u.s. generals and admirals joined the list, followed by 31 more the next day, on sept. 9, and another 44 on sept. 16, bringing the total number of flag officers who have endorsed trump to 184.

"state that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes state that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes 'this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority' published 3 mins ago about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in 2006 after nearly three decades with the associated press, as well as several upper midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. print dr. eric walsh photo first liberty 
the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church. 
but dr. eric walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons. 
walshs ordeal began in may 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventh-day adventist church. 
lee rudd, the agencys human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately. two days later, walsh was fired. 
at that point, lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks, chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the constitution. order today! 
now, in response to walshs lawsuit, the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, copies of his sermon notes and transcripts. 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church, said jeremy dys, senior counsel for first liberty. 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons, said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so. 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen. 
the mayor at the time, annise parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . 
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case, welch said, i cant believe im saying this, but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from  us. 
welch, the executive director of the texas pastor council, said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons. 
first, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city, he said. also, the state is demanding much more material sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible. its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study. this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in america. 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee, part of the nations largest public policy womens group with 500,000 members, also came to walshs defense. 
penny nance, ceo, said the words of reverend dr. martin luther king, jr., that, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapo-like tactics of his native state. the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, dr. eric walsh, is indeed a threat to every american, whatever our religious beliefs. 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share? 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him. 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon, dys told fox news when the case was filed. he was fired for something he said in a sermon. if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything. the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist.

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan. the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision. donald trump, you see, is racist because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my african-american. hillary clinton, on the other hand, is not anti-semitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a f-ing jew bastard. 
with a republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small, real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass. so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flat-out lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers, as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
in heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear. clinton, a year ago, flat-out said, the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment. to normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. 
meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal, when the accurate description is national security scandal. the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. the law does not require, as fbi director james comey falsely stated, an intent. nor is it relevant, as clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was hacked. 
five people who worked with or for clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. but the target, that is to say hillary clinton, was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. so why the immunity deals? who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares? 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy. this would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie, given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are under-employed. 
meanwhile, its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist gloria allred. allred, a clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers. one such accuser, juanita broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, hillary clinton verbally threatened her. 
hillary clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation. never. and only one national reporter, sam donaldson, has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation. ever. clintons answer? he referred donaldson to his lawyer, david kendall. donaldson quickly tried again, asking the then-president to simply deny it. same answer my attorney  speaks for me. and that was that. 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since 1949; who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk; who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different; whose charitable foundation engaged in pay-to-play in haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and non-donors went to the back of the line; who wants to gut the second amendment; who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis, russia and the chinese; and whose media compadres, including scribes with the new york times, washington post and cnbc, have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign. and she is now odds-on favorite to become the next president of the united states. receive larry elder's commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elder's alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email. name",238,736264,real

gorani interjected, thats cnn, youre calling us the clinton news network, to which hopkins immediately responded, thats exactly correct. 
when gorani pressed as to why hopkins would say such a thing about the network, hopkins explained that she was referring to the manipulated polls that cnn routinely passes off on viewers showing clinton with a seemingly insurmountable lead over trump.   
hopkins proceeded to say that she and many others had grown bored with the collection of meaningless polls that were clearly biased in favor of clinton and downplayed support for trump. 
i will say having sat in the republican convention and having watched your coverage, it is completely biased. and i think trump is doing a great job, stated hopkins. 
the two then attempted to speak over each other for a moment, with gorani demanding proof that cnn was biased, until hopkins finally broke through by decrying cnns portrayal of woman as victims who need to be shielded from someone like trump, informing the host that women in general are plenty capable of deciding for themselves if they are threatened by trump or not. 
she then proceeded to state that polls have shown how much clinton is disliked by the general public, even saying, i find her abhorrent to look at. her little smile there does nothing for me.",35,736265,fake
"breaking weiner cooperating with fbi on hillary email investigation red state  
fox news sunday reported this morning that anthony weiner is cooperating with the fbi, which has re-opened yes, lefties re-opened the investigation into hillary clintons classified emails. watch as chris wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show 
and the news is breaking while were on the air. our colleague bret baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that anthony weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife huma abedin, is cooperating with the fbi investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didnt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. pretty interesting development. 
targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. given weiners well-known penchant for lying, its hard to believe that a prosecutor would give weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. but cooperation can take many forms  and, as wallace indicated on this mornings show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. well see if weiners cooperation extends beyond that. more related",0,736268,real

"weiner sexting of 15-year-old girl leads to new fbi investigation of hillary emails weiner sexting of 15-year-old girl leads to new fbi investigation of hillary emails   
the giant flaming garbage dump that is clintonworld is offering up a wonderful new development sure to excite anyone who wanted to combine the weiner scandal and the hillary email scandal. 
yes virginia, you can now have both of them in one. like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one, they've been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic. 
the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails  apparently during the probe of former rep. anthony weiners sexting  in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election. 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. 
comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case. 
an fbi source, though, confirmed to fox news that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced rep. weiner and his wife huma abedin, a top clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. the new york times first reported on the weiner investigation connection, noting the fbi had been probing texts weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl. 
as donald trump and congressional republicans seized on the fbis decision, interim democratic party leader donna brazile simply tweeted, good grief, after the news of the anthony weiner connection broke. 
can't argue with her there. 
it would be hilarious if anthony weiner and thereby huma abedin led to the downfall of hillary's lifelong ambition. you just know someone is going to ""commit suicide"" in a d.c. park. 
but does anyone in the democratic party really look forward to 4 to 8 years of this? this is how big of a mess hillary is now. we've reached the point where her ongoing email scandal is now intertwined with a sexting investigation of a 15-year-old girl. and that's just during the election.",72,736266,fake

"lol! british wife of lib actor who said there will never be a president donald trumpwarns americans about president-elect trump video go to article 
political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j. trump and his tough immigration policies. maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders. it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, there will never be a president trump. 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us -mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of president-elect trumps proposals would be violations of international law. 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of george clooney, said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans. 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign, that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the u.s. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that. 
the 38-year-old wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to, are these things actually going to happen?, or is the u.s. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally, according to the hollywood reporter. 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george, a staunch hillary clinton supporter, have spoken out against trump in the past. 
earlier this year, amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views.

"did democrats really stuff ballot? here's their answer print fairfax county, virginia, voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot, among others 
democratic party officials in fairfax county, virginia, are categorically denying that pro-democrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot, arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee, or fcdc. 
earlier this week, jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot. see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article. also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters. 
i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year, jena explained. then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot. 
in recent days, at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots. 
after the report was first published, and shared on facebook by david jones, fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained. 
these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot. the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections. political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots. the two envelopes arrived at the same time, commented anderson. 
that triggered a quick back-and-forth between david jones and anderson. 
i hate to tell you but youre wrong. all items came in one envelope, jones said. 
like the reporting you see here? sign up for free news alerts from wnd.com, americas independent news network. 
impossible. that letter came out of my office. we never have access to other peoples ballots, replied anderson. 
then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters, said jones. who should i believe? you or my lying eyes? 
anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot, and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives. 
i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed. we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots. you can believe what you want to believe, concluded anderson. 
the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response. but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america, anderson protested the premise of the story. 
please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim, stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate. 
he shared a photo sent by state sen. scott surovell, showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy. 
in a formal interview, fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true. 
its not possible, said neilson, who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats. 
voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen, he said. the activity of voting is also a public record. the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot. we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed. 
the same day the ballot is mailed, our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot, said neilson, noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax. 
listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson 
however, he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself. 
that material is mailed in a separate envelope, labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax, virginia, and would be received either the same day, perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government, neilson said. 
its a separate mailing. its a separate stamp. its a separate envelope. its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes, he said. 
jones is standing by her story 100 percent, as is her husband. david says its a very clear memory. 
jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot, the green sample ballot, the two-sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature. there was also the return envelope, which i signed, david said. 
the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters. both of them commented on reddit. 
i can confirm this. i live in herndon, va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot. i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it, stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename.

another, under the reddit handle nightingale-nights, said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week. 
neilson said there is no way the county government, which sends out the ballots, could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot. 
they dont have our materials, he said. our materials are printed for us, by our printer, and we have complete control over our materials in our office, and they come from our office in our mailing. they dont go anywhere else. 
its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials. its never happened before. im not aware of it happening now. and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future, neilson said. 
there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county, leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible. he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot. 
i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots. i believe that, jones said. i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material. i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope. but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues. 
neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true. 
i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail, neilson said. 
he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight. 
i am an election official. on election day, i serve in a non-partisan capacity for our county election office, nielson said. i can assure you, you have democrats and republicans working in the office. you have plenty of oversight of the voting process, and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot. there is no way that happened. 
the following are three images of the democratic party materials jena and david jones say they found stuffed inside the absentee ballot

"hillary emails 'whitelisted' for obama's blackberry hillary emails 'whitelisted' for obama's blackberry president could only receive messages from pre-approved accounts published 1 min ago 
fox news president obamas high-security blackberry used a special process known as whitelisting that only allowed it to take calls and messages from pre-approved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the set-up told fox news  pointing to the detail as further proof the white house knew hillary clintons private account was used for government business. 
as the administration now acknowledges, obama and clinton emailed each other while she was helming the state department. if received on his blackberry, the whitelisting safeguard means clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission  covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. the obama blackberry would have also been configured to accept the communications. 
think of whitelisting like a bouncer in the vip line at the party. if you are on the list you get in, if you are not, you get bounced to the pavement, said bob gourley, former chief technology officer cto for the dia, and now a partner with strategic consulting and engineering firm cognitio.",238,736264,real

this exchange between fox news sunday host chris wallace and clinton campaign manager robbie mook highlighted why the email scandal isnt working for the gop. 
video 
transcript via fox news sunday wallace the last question i want to ask you is that youre acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was hillary clinton who brought this into the election. 
i want to go back to the e-mail exchange on march 2nd, 2015, when the new york times broke the story about hillary clinton using private e-mails. were going to put it up on the screen. 
clinton adviser neera tanden, why didnt they get the stuff out like 18 months ago? so crazy. 
campaign chairman john podesta, unbelievable. tanden, i guess i know the answer, they wanted to get away with it. 
robby, it was clinton who delayed and it was clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign. 
mook and it is secretary clinton who has said this was a mistake. it is secretary clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation. and it was secretary clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation. and what secretary clinton is doing now is saying, if theres new information, get it out on the table. lets get it out. these could be duplicates. 
again, its been reported these e-mails may not have been sent or received by secretary clinton. we dont know anything. and this close to an election, this unprecedented announcement of new information, when  when, again, its been reported by yahoo! news that  that the fbi may have not even seen it. that  that  that director comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesnt even know what the information is. thats disturbing. and were just asking him, get everything out there that he knows. 
fox news has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of clinton, so they have been reduced to whining about why she didnt release the emails sooner. what wallace left out was that the release of clintons emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure. 
hillary clinton didnt cause this email scandal. house republicans misused their benghazi select committee to go on a fishing expedition for hillary clintons emails. 
robbie mook destroyed fox news with facts, because unlike donald trump, hillary clinton hasnt worked to keep information hidden from the public. trump has not released his tax returns, medical records, or an accounting of his business dealings with russia. trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than 40 years. 
republicans and conservative media are blaming clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election. 
clintons campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing.",133,736267,real

war i, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. ever since gorbachev naively ended the cold war, the hugely over-armed united states has been actively surrounding russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, nato expansion. at the same time, in recent years the demonization of vladimir putin has reached war propaganda levels. russians have every reason to believe that the united states is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. this mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an evil enemy make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.  diana johnstone, author of queen of chaos the misadventures of hillary clinton all in the family just pals, all of them, just pals. its all been such a joyful ride. obviously neither clinton, nor obama, or carter, find anything amiss in celebrating george w bush, one of the worst criminals in modern history. george w. bush presidential library and museum on the campus of southern methodist university in dallas, texas, april 25, 2013. official white house photo by pete souza in september 2013 president obama stood before the united nations general assembly and declared, i believe america is exceptional. the following year at the un, the president classified russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the islamic state and the ebola virus. on march 9, 2015 president barack obama declared venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states. vladimir putin, speaking at the un in 2015, addressing the united states re its foreign policy do you realize what you have done? since the end of world war 2, the united states has attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments, most of which were democratically-elected. dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries. attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders. attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries. grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries. plus  although not easily quantified  has been more involved in the practice of torture than any other country in the world  for over a century  not just performing the actual torture, but teaching it, providing the manuals, and furnishing the equipment. see chapter 18 of william blum, rogue state a guide to the worlds only superpower on october 28, 2016 russia was voted off the un human rights council. at the same time saudi arabia won a second term, uncontested. does anyone know george orwells email address? a million refugees from washingtons warfare are currently over-running europe. theyre running from afghanistan and iraq; from libya and somalia; from syria and pakistan. germany is taking in many syrian refugees because of its world war two guilt. what will the united states do in the future because of its guilt? but americans are not raised to feel such guilt.  the plan is for the united states to rule the world. the overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. it calls for the united states to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. it calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. it says not that the united states must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful. vice-president dick cheney  west point lecture, june 2002 two flew over the cuckoos nest we are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known.  security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on americas military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.  dick cheney and liz cheney, why the world needs a powerful america 2015 state department spokesperson mark toner assad must go even if syria goes with him. many of the moves the obama administration has made in terms of its cuba policy are in lockstep with bill clintons, as expressed in the recommendations of a 1999 task force report from the council on foreign relations. the report asserted that no change in policy should have the primary effect of consolidating, or appearing to legitimize, the political status quo on the island. a successful american regime change operation in syria would cut across definite interests of the russian state. these include the likely use of syria as a new pipeline route to bring gas from qatar to the european market, thereby undercutting gazprom, russias largest corporation and biggest exporter. assads refusal to consider such a route played no small role in qatars pouring billions of dollars in arms and funds into the syrian civil war on behalf of anti-assad forces. war with russia will be nuclear. washington has prepared for it. washington has abandoned the abm treaty, created what it thinks is an abm shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit us nuclear first strike. all of this is obviously directed at russia, and the russian government knows it. how long will russia sit there waiting for washingtons first strike?  paul craig roberts, 2014 iran signed the nuclear accords with the united states earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. any iranian nuclear ambition, real or imagined, is of course a result of american hostility towards iran, and not the other way around. if the european union were an independent and rational government it would absolutely forbid any member country from stockpiling american nuclear weapons or hosting a us anti-ballistic missile site or any other military base anywhere close to russias borders. full spectrum dominance , a term the pentagon loves to use to refer to total control of the planet land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace. can you imagine any other country speaking this way? henry kissinger at the paris peace talks, september 1970. i refuse to believe that a little fourth rate power like north vietnam does not have a breaking point. in 2010, wikileaks released a cable sent to us embassies by then- secretary of state hillary clinton. she wrote this saudi arabia remains a critical financial support for al qaeda, the taliban, al nusra and other terrorist groups  worldwide. surely this resulted in at least washingtons much-favored weapon sanctions of various kinds. it did not. us general barry mccaffrey , april 2015 because so far natos reaction to putins aggression sic has been to send a handful of forces to the baltics to demonstrate resolve, which has only convinced putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. so we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest putins stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to protect russia-speaking people. for gods sake, the last time we heard that was just before hitler invaded the sudetenland. no, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1978 when the united states invaded the tiny nation of grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. it was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that didnt believe that the american empire was gods gift to humanity. since 1980, the united states has intervened in the affairs of fourteen muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. they are in chronological order iran, libya, lebanon, kuwait, iraq, somalia, bosnia, saudi arabia, afghanistan, sudan, kosovo, yemen, pakistan, and now syria. how our never-ending mideast horror began radio address of george w. bush, september 28, 2002 the iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the british government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. the regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al qaeda terrorists inside iraq. this regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year. yet  just six weeks before 911, condoleezza rice told cnn lets remember that his saddams country is divided, in effect. he does not control the northern part of his country. we are able to keep his arms from him. his military forces have not been rebuilt. the fact is that there is more participation by the cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the american population in the running of theirs. one important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the united states, exert great influence over all aspects of life. the u.s. is frantically surrounding china with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from japan, south korea and the philippines through several nearby smaller pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in australia  the u.s. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol chinas nearby waters. warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon. jack a. smith, hegemony games usa vs. prc, counterpunch crimea had never voluntarily left russia. the ussrs leader nikita khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated crimea to ukraine in 1954. crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin russia after the us-induced ukrainian coup in 2014. russian president vladimir putin refers to the ukrainian army as natos foreign legion, which does not pursue ukraines national interests. the united states, however, insists on labeling the russian action in crimea as an invasion. putin re crimeaukraine our western partners sic created the kosovo precedent with their own hands. in a situation absolutely the same as the one in crimea they recognized kosovos secession from serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a countrys central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary and the un international court of justice agreed with those arguments. thats what they said; thats what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept  and now they are complaining about crimea. why is that? paul craig roberts the absurdity of it all! even a moron knows that if russia is going to put tanks and troops into ukraine, russia will put in enough to do the job. the war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. as putin himself said some months ago, if the russian military enters ukraine, the news will not be the fate of donetsk or mauriupol, but the fall of kiev and lviv. in a major examination of us policy vis-à-vis china, published in march 2015, the authoritative council on foreign relations bluntly declared that there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, peaceful coexistence, mutual understanding, a strategic partnership, or a new type of major country relations between the united states and china. the united states, the report declares, must, therefore, develop the political will and military capabilities to deal with china to protect vital u.s. interests. john f. kennedy changed the mission of the latin american military from hemispheric defense  an outdated relic of world war ii  to internal security, which means war against the domestic population.  noam chomsky cuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an american team are not defectors, a word which has a clear political connotation. boris yeltsin was acceptable to american and europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed western capital free rein in the newly opened russian territory following the collapse of the soviet union. yeltsins era was also a time of rampant corruption by russian oligarchs who were closely associated with western capital. that corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of vladimir putin twice as president between 2000-2008, and again in 2012. many isis leaders were former iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by american troops. the fight isnt against isis, its against assad; at the next level it isnt against assad, its against putin; then, at the next level, it isnt against putin, its against the country most likely to stand in the way of us world domination, russia. and its forever. connecting to the us-based internet

the discipline of peace and conflict studies no mention was made that iraqs christians had been safe and sound under president saddam hussein  even privileged  until president george bush invaded and destroyed iraq. we can expect the same fate for syrias christians if the protection of the assad regime is torn away by the us-engineered uprising. we will then shed crocodile tears for syrias

dock with earphones like eichmann and make them listen to the evidence of how they killed millions of people and almost murdered the planet and made most of us far more miserable than we needed to be. of course, we wouldnt have time to go after them one by one. wed have to lump wall street investment bankers in one trial, the council on foreign relations in another, and any remaining harvard

"ashton kutcher rescues 6,000 sex trafficking victims, arrests over 2,000 traffickers video christopher ashton kutcher is a well-known figure in the american entertainment industry. apart from acting, kutcher is also an investor. a venture capitalist, kutcher has successfully invested in several high technology startups with some of his investments including skype, foursquare, airbnb, path and fab.com. but despite being a businessman and a public figure, societal problems are dear to his heart. in 2008, kutcher and his ex-wife, demi moore decided to tackle one of the more serious crimes facing our modern world  humansex trafficking.
by basic definition, human trafficking is the trade of humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation. the trade is a modern form of slavery . it involves controlling a person through force, fraud, or coercion to exploit the victim. over the years, the united nations, international non-governmental organizations, human rights activists, and individuals have all stepped up efforts in order to end the trade. however, due to the high rate of unemployment and rising poverty levels in some nations, the trade is still secretly thriving.
also, with the rise of the internet and technology, it is becoming increasingly easy for traffickers to lure people, especially young girls, into the dirty business. mostly, traffickers will hide on the deep web, using sophisticated gadgets to carry out their trade.
kutcher and moore decided to concentrate their efforts on the internet, to thwart the trade of the traffickers. they set up an organization called thorn. thorns mission is very simple to eliminate sex-trafficking and child exploitation over the internet.
with the help of around 20 technology companies, they set up the thorn task technical force. technology companies such as facebook, google, twitter, yahoo!, snapchat and imgur are all part of this task force.
they dedicate their time and resources to searching the darker corners of the internet, hunting out traffickers who have been involving in trafficking innocent people. since establishing thorn in 2008, the organization has so far, identified and rescued over 6,000 trafficking victims and captured over 2,000 traffickers  many of which are now in the process of facing criminal charges.",16,736266,fake

russias recent parliamentary elections were, by and large, a dress rehearsal for the more important presidential elections coming up in 2018. between now and then, members of the political establishment will be able to try on new roles, experiment with new campaign slogans, and determine who will play a starring role within the kremlins inner circle. the central consideration is how to consolidate power in a way that balances the interests of the government and the population.
to get an inside look at russias current political landscape, russia direct sat down with andrei kolesnikov of the carnegie moscow center. according to him, the 2016 parliamentary elections provide a preview of what to expect in 2018 and beyond.
russia direct to what extent were the 2016 parliamentary elections fair and legitimate, in your view? andrei kolesnikov in fact, they were juridically legitimate because they were conducted in accordance with russian law. however, the degree of the political, not juridical legitimacy is a debatable question because of the low turnout it means that the representation of russian citizens in the parliament became even less than previously. about one-third of the russian population voted at the elections. ;
even though the united russia ruling party garnered four million fewer votes than during the 2011 elections, it received more seats in the parliament. in addition, liberal politicians are not included in the parliament at all. thus, politically, the legitimacy of the elections is a matter of question.
regarding honesty, these elections were fair in the polling stations with observers, to a large extent. they were honest in the regions, in which the central election commission controlled the electoral process in cooperation with observers. ;
to a lesser extent, these elections were fair and transparent in the distant russian regions or  in the words of prominent political expert dmitry oreshkin  zones of peculiar electoral culture, which saw an abnormally high electoral turnout. i mean, for instance, the republic of tuva in southern siberia, the north caucasus, kemerovo region etc. ;
these regions were controlled by the central election commission to a much lesser extent  no wonder that people were compelled to vote in accordance with the orders of local authorities. the violations in these regions were likely to be common. ;
andrei kolesnikov, ;senior associate and chair of the russian domestic politics and political institutions program at the carnegie moscow center. press photo 
rd does russias central election commission have any tools to influence voting in the distant regions? a.k. there are some instruments, but local authorities limit and restrict them. i dont think the administration of the russian president hampered the work of the central election commission head, ella pamfilova. she tried to balance the interests of russian president vladimir putin and the interests of the countrys civil society. ;
this is the middle-of-the-road position and it is very difficult. she just tried to take into account all positions and signals that were coming from the regions during the electoral campaign and could not ignore them. there were so many of these signals that she objectively and physically could not control the shy;elections throughout the country, especially, in the distant regions.  ;  ;  ;  ;
rd what kinds of violations took place during the 2016 elections, if any? a.k. violations took place, even though they were not large-scale, like previously during the 2011 elections. these violations included the use of administrative resources for influence, rigged and fabricated voting, stuffing the ballot box, and dirty political techniques against the liberal and communist parties during the political campaign and before election day. ;
there was also orchestrated voting, when cadets, students and governmental employees were ordered to vote. this also should be taken into account. all these violations took place not only in distant regions, but also in those under the steady control of the central election commission.
rd why did the united russia party win despite its declining popularity throughout russia? ; a.k. the fact the united russia won the majority in the state duma and the partys popularity are basically different things. its popularity has been decreasing indeed. it is one reality. but it doesnt prevent the party from winning most of the seats. that is the other reality. ;
russian citizens dont see the party as a body that deals with the problems of the population . the credibility and approval rankings of almost all governmental bodies, except law enforcement agencies and the president himself, are dropping. and united russia is not the exception, because people perceive it not as a party, but as a kind of a governmental body. its rating will keep going down, but slowly, step by step.  ;  ;  ; ;
usually, if you vote for united russia, it means a mechanical, symbolic process, a sort of political law-abiding ritual. if you are law-abiding and go to the polling station, you are likely to vote for united russia, because it is necessary. this is the very logic and motivation that drive average voters to elect united russia.  ;
even though some people preferred not to vote for the ruling party, they voted for the current authorities, because there were no real alternatives they voted either for one of the three systemic parliamentary parties or the spoiler parties, which aimed at distracting the attention of voters and preventing the opposition from gaining parliamentary seats.  ;
rd why did the russian opposition fail and what is its key problem? a.k. the reason why they failed can be traced back to the personal ambitions of the opposition leaders. they couldnt team up and compete with each other. in addition, they have different values, in fact. i mean right-leaning liberals and left-leaning liberals dont always agree. this does matter, after all. moreover, these leaders dont have enough political heft. most of them cannot be considered powerful and influential political figures.  ;
another problem is that the authoritarian regime in russia will prevent the emergence of new powerful liberal forces in russia. if such a party emerges and poses a serious challenge to the authorities like opposition leader alexei navalny did, it will be either destroyed or discredited and marginalized. so, in such a situation, it is very difficult to come up with a pragmatic solution. however, this years parliamentary elections proved that the only political democratic force  ;noticeable on a scale of a whole country is the yabloko party and its leader grigory yavlinsky, no matter how you view them. ;
indeed, it is losing popularity year after year, but this party remains firmly within the countrys political landscape and if the opposition is able to persuade voters that yabloko brings together different representatives of liberal and democratic forces as well as well-educated intelligentsia, they might succeed in the future. but in reality its hardly probable. ;
rd you said that the kremlin would prevent the emergence of a new powerful liberal political force in russia, because the existence of such a force contradicts the nature of the authoritarian regime. yet why are the russian authorities afraid of everything that is associated with liberals, if those within the kremlin are pretty confident, if their approval rankings are high among the majority of russians, if people dont trust liberals and the idea of liberalism is totally discredited in the country? a.k. well, first, it is a matter of the logic of development of any authoritative regime. it adds up to total political control. second, in fact, the authorities are not so confident that they are so popular among the people, as implied by the words of russian president vladimir putin, who came to the united russia headquarters after the elections and said that, despite economic challenges and the difficult situation, people voted for united russia. if you read between the lines, you can detect the feeling of the lack of confidence. ;
it means that the social contract  economic well-being in exchange for political freedoms we restrict your political freedoms, but feed you instead  doesnt work anymore and might be not so relevant. thats why the authorities find it necessary to feed people with imperial pride, wars, crimea and increase political control and establish a political monopoly, which also means creating fake liberal parties such as the party of growth. after all, it is a good example of the spoiler artificial party created within the kremlins test tube. and this control is likely to persist as long as this regime exists.  ;
rd what will the 2016 parliamentary elections change in russian politics? a.k. basically, there wont be big changes. tactically, these elections aimed at preparing the groundwork for the 2018 presidential elections and testing russias current political system . and in this regard, this task was fulfilled. by 2018 putin is going to look for new faces and figures to renew his team, but this is going to be a different political process, even though it is partly related to the parliamentary elections. ;
rd you said the 2016 parliamentary elections were a proving ground for the 2018 presidential elections and tested russias current political system. could you be more specific? ; a.k. these elections confirmed the legitimacy of the current russian authorities. once again, the kremlin sees that it does have the mandate to rule the country. putin himself does have this mandate, because the ruling party is associated with his name, and the countrys political unity is based on the crimea narrative and the parliament itself. ;
the system passed the test successfully. so, it can work for a certain period of time as long as everybody is satisfied with this model. thus, the system is ready to live for another 18 months until the 2018 presidential elections, with the parliament organically embedded in this system and ready to fulfill blindly all orders from the president. ;
the other question is how will these elections be conducted in terms of obvious predictability and the absolute absence of interest toward them given the fact that nobody can compete with putin. in fact, he is the only candidate who will win. so, there is the lack of motivation for voters to come to the polling stations in 2018.  ;  ;
rd do you mean that the turnout at the presidential election will be low? ; a.k. the turnout is going to be the key question. in fact, the 2018 election is a referendum that will test the credibility and approval of one person putin. in this situation, the authorities have to create an artificial rivalry to putin, but it is hardly likely to work. the real rival wont be allowed to compete with putin openly, if we are talking about navalny. thus, if putin is once again elected president, there is no motivation to vote. ;
on the other hand, as indicated by this years parliamentary election, those who came to the polling stations observed a sort of political ritual. it is a matter of carrying out a law-abiding commitment. and this might drive people to vote in many russian regions and have an impact on the electoral turnout. however, i expect it to be lower than during the parliamentary elections, especially in moscow and st. petersburg. importantly, the turnout will be low not because people do not trust putin  it will be low because of the absolute predictability of the elections, because of the absence of competition.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ; ;
rd to what extent were this years parliamentary elections different from the ones in 2011  and why didnt they lead to protests ? ; a.k. well, the situations are totally different. in 2011, people were waiting for changes and the continuation of modernization, with urbanites frustrated by the rigged voting and obvious violations during the parliamentary elections. they were also disappointed with the presidential swap, when then president dmitry medvedev decided not to stand for the 2012 presidency and let putin come to power once again, depriving them of the opportunity of a choice. eventually, they took to the streets. ;
yet their protests failed to bring changes among the authorities. moreover, these protests brought about a series of arrests, which had a chilling effect on the protesters. afterwards, the authorities took very repressive legal measures  including the dima yakovlev law that bans foreign families from adopting russian orphans, the laws that restrict the right to organize rallies, laws on foreign agents and undesirable organizations, and other restrictive measures. ;
thus, by the beginning of this years elections, people had been very discouraged. they didnt believe that they could change something. they were not ready to take to the streets. they were totally apathetic and disappointed politically. on top of that, there was the incorporation of crimea. this narrative played its role in bringing people together around the authorities.
also read russia direct's report "" decoding social transformations in russia "" rd remarkably, those who took to the streets in 2011 supported crimeas incorporation. ; a.k. statistically, it is difficult to make any conclusions, yet the correlation does exist. indeed, crimea helped to mobilize people, even part of the liberal-minded citizens. it became the key narrative that mobilized the nation. those who didnt support the incorporation of crimea are seen as outcasts. they are considered to be outsiders. ;
rd how long will the crimea effect be able to unite people around the authorities? ; a.k. it is difficult to say for sure. probably, the abrupt worsening of living standards and drop in income might influence the behavior of the population. yet this is just a hypothesis, because people are still very satisfied with crimeas return to russia they see themselves as being part of a great power. ;
according to the polls of the levada center, people are still supporting the kremlins foreign policy, they dont want the sanctions to be canceled, and they believe they are above these sanctions. they think that russia should keep the counter-sanctions policy instead of trying to persuade the west to lift these sanctions. this mobilization  being in the state of quasi-war  helps them to deal with the economic crisis and adjust to it. honestly, there are no signs of political indignation, which means that people wont orchestrate large-scale political protests.  ;  ;
rd shortly after the parliamentary elections, russian media reported about the kremlins plans to create the ministry of state security or mgb in the russian abbreviation, which is expected to bring together all russian law security agencies. so, it seems to be a reanimated version of the old kgb. what does it mean for russias political future? a.k. russian law enforcement officers play today a significant role in the countrys decision-making process. so, if these plans come true, it means that the authorities are trying to hedge political risks it is a matter of the system defending itself in advance. one of the goals of the mgb is to provide security for the president and this problem will be more relevant by the end of the state dumas tenure, by 2021, because it will be the time when the future of putin will be determined. ;
after 2021, there will be the questions from people and political elites if putin will remain at the helm after 2024 or not, if he will nominate his successor or not, if he will be a lame duck or not. all these questions need to be clarified. and to feel more confident and secure, he needs absolute control. and the creation of such a monstrosity like the mgb is quite logical in such a situation. but this leak about mgb was no more than proving public and elites opinions. presumably, right now this body will not be created.  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;
rd there is some speculation that putin might be concerned with a plot prepared by some members of russias political elite. is it really the case? a.k. in fact, today there are not any signs of a conspiracy against putin. the stakeholders within the russian political elites are not interested in it, given a great deal of solidarity and unity around the crimea narrative. even though putin is autocratic in his nature, nevertheless he is very popular among the elites. he builds such a political machine that guarantees him security and prevents any possibility of a coup détat.  ;  ;
rd yet recently putin reshuffled his political deck and asked his chief of staff, sergei ivanov , a former kgb officer, to resign. anton vaino , who was seen by some experts as a political unknown and a neutral technocratic political figure, replaced ivanov. does this resignation mean that putin hedges the risks and just wants to get rid of those who might compete with him? ; a.k. actually, this is the trend, which means the 2018 new team of the president will consist of docile, absolutely loyal bureaucrats, who will be distant from the leader and wont have any claims for power. this is in contrast to putins cronies  governmental oligarchs and his close friends. ;
this team will also comprise the bureaucrats and average men from law enforcement agencies, including security guards and representatives of the special services. this is how putin sees effective governance; this is how he is going to reform the governance system. this is part of his strategy to save his personal security during his next presidential term. these people will have to provide putin with security when he either retires or hands over power to his successor.

""putin is an observer. he is like a weighing-machine that takes into account all views and tries to balance them."" ; photo ria novosti  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ; ;
rd there is also speculation that putin is trying to fuel an artificial rivalry between different law enforcement agencies to strengthen his positions in the kremlin. do you agree? a.k. partly, it is the case. the logic of the mgb is to control this rivalry, watch over it closely and make it more transparent within one big entity. after all, putin is an observer. he is like a weighing-machine that takes into account all views and tries to balance them. he gives them room to compete with each other up to a point and makes certain conclusions. it is a matter of effective political management. ;
look at alexander bastrykin, the chairman of the russian investigative committee. he has been very influential until recently, but he started expressing political claims and got in trouble in july 2016 the federal security service fsb conducted a series of inspections in the investigative committees offices and arrested high-profile officials suspected of corruption and embezzlement  editors note. ;
today, putin doesnt need independent and very corrupt figures. he is ready to put up with the riches of his governmental oligarchs, but as long as they can hide it and fulfill their commitments within their governmental corporations. ;
summing up, putin is creating the environment that can provide him with security and insurance and control the wars with the kremlins inner circle . russias political elites have already received a lot of signals from him if somebody behaves in a wrong way, he will be either dismissed or accused of corruption.
rd how do you see the role of medvedev, given that he has acquired the reputation of a very weak and docile politician? to what extent does he fit into the system? ; a.k. his weakness is his power. his purposefully technocratic nature is his competitive capability. he is convenient, docile. he is between the loyal systemic liberals and law enforcement officials. in addition, his informal agreement with putin is still intact and relevant. politically, it is not in putins interest to replace medvedev with a more powerful and independent politician. ;
in this case putin should choose between liberals and hawks  between former finance minister alexei kudrin and igor sechin the head of russias largest oil company rosneft. yet putin cannot do it right now. he has to choose a middle-of-the-road, technocratic and docile figure like medvedev, who will become a very convenient way to shift responsibility for the economic crisis after 2018. ;
in this regard, the ideal candidate to replace medvedev is anton vaino, putins current chief of staff, or his deputy sergei kiriyenko, who in the eyes of russians was responsible for the 1998 economic default. however, medvedev is a much more experienced politician.
also read "" inside the anti-corruption campaign against russia's liberals "" rd you mentioned the hawks and liberals within the kremlins inner circle. who is more influential today? a.k. you can look at this hierarchy both simplistically and from a more sophisticated point of view. if we tend to simplify, there are the hawks or conservatives and doves or liberals while the former are responsible for politics and foreign policy, the latter deal with the economy, business, the budget and fiscal policy. ;
on the other hand, all these players, especially, law enforcement officials hawks are involved in clan wars to a larger extent than the liberals, who, basically, have nothing to compete for if we dont take into account the debates between the economy ministry, finance ministry and the central banks about the nuances of russias economic policy. ;
the closer we look at the political groups within the kremlin, the more obvious it becomes that all these players are included in putins team in fact, they have less differences than commonalities. after all, all of them support the crimean consensus. they support putins domestic and foreign policy, even though some of them liberals dont approve it. they are just adjusting to the current political situation without openly expressing their disagreement.
rd sooner or later putin will have to step down. to what extent will the transition of power be difficult in russia? a.k. this transition will be very difficult at any rate. after all, there hasnt been a rotation of power for years. the nuance is putin can accelerate the transition to democracy only if it brings benefits to him to save his personal security. if technocrats and liberals are able to persuade him that his security depends on democracy, he might chose this path, yet, again, not because he likes democracy. today he is not ready for liberalization.

"inner earth glows like in the movie avatar can there be light below the surface of the earth, without any exposure to the sun? surprisingly, the answer is yes. by robert sepehr
bioluminescent organisms have the ability to glow almost like magic. many organisms use their natural ability to produce light to trick predators, to attract mates and even to communicate.
the word for this seemingly magical ability is called bioluminescence, which comes from bio, meaning life, and lumin, meaning light.
most of these organisms, such as plankton, glow blue, but a few glow red, green, or orange. some tiny animal plankton zooplankton are big enough to see with the unaided eye.

most bioluminescent zooplankton dont glow in the dark themselves, but instead squirt globs of glowing chemicals into the water.
some zooplankton use bioluminescence to attract a mate, or to form reproductive swarms. not only is natures biochemistry fascinating, it can also be extremely beautiful, especially given the backdrop of a dark, misty cave.
glow worm is the common name for various groups of insect larvae and adult larviform females that glow through bioluminescence. they may sometimes resemble worms, but are actually insects.
the glow they produce, through by a chemical reaction, is incredibly efficient; nearly 100 of the energy input is turned into light compare this to the best light-emitting diodes at just 24.
australia and new zealand have some of the most spectacular caves, where one can go on guided tours to witness this natural phenomenon up close. see video below
why do some mushrooms emit light? making light isnt common in fungi; scientists have described about 100,000 fungal species, and only 75 glow. lab work has shown that the glow did not happen randomly or by accident.
scientists found that these mushrooms made light mostly at night, so experiments were conducted to determine why.
according to studies  referenced in the book , in dark environments, bioluminescent fruit bodies may be at an advantage by attracting insects and other arthropods that could help disperse their spores.
conditions that affect the growth of fungi, such as ph, light and temperature, have been found to influence bioluminescence, suggesting a link between metabolic activity and fungal bioluminescence.

the diversity of creatures with this ability is equally astonishing, from algae and the common firefly to deep-sea dwellers that are rarely seen by humans.
whats also fascinating is that many of these creatures are not closely related, and bioluminescent traits have seemingly evolved separately at least 30 times.
with countless well lit subterranean caves and glowing caverns, it makes one wonder what could be dwelling in vast unexplored areas under the crust.
the idea that our planet consists of a hollow, or honeycombed, interior is not new. some of the oldest cultures speak of civilizations inside of vast cavern-cities, within the bowels of the earth.
according to certain buddhist and hindu traditions, secret tunnels connect tibet with a subterranean paradise, and they call this legendary underworld agartha.
in india, this underground oasis is best known by its sanskrit name, shambhala, thought to mean place of tranquility.
mythologies throughout the world, from north and south america to europe and the arctic, describe numerous entrances to these fabled inner kingdoms.
many occult organizations, esoteric authors, and secret societies concur with these myths and legends of subterranean inhabitants, who are the remnants of antediluvian civilizations, which sought refuge in hollow caverns inside the earth.
assuming that the myths are true, and the earth is partially hollow, how could life survive underground? how would organisms receive the ventilation required to breathe miles below the surface?
surface trees and rainforests are responsible for less than one-third of the earths oxygen, while marine plants, such as phytoplankton, are responsible for between 70 to 80 percent of the oxygen in the earths atmosphere. the vast majority of our oxygen comes from aquatic organisms.
phytoplankton, kelp, and algae produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, a process which converts carbon dioxide and light into sugars which are then used for energy.
phytoplankton is responsible for half of earths oxygen
while the process of photosynthesis usually implies the presence of sunlight, the sun is not the only available light or energy source able to power photosynthesis.
before the discovery of hydrothermal vents, and their ecosystems, scientists believed that only small animals lived at the ocean bottom, in seafloor sediments.
they theorized that these animals received their food from above, because the established model of the marine food chain depended on sunlight and photosynthesis, just as the food chain on land does.
mainstream academia taught that this was the only way life could survive in the darkness of the deep seafloor. the discovery of hydrothermal vents changed all that.
it became clear that vast communities of animals grew quickly and to larger than expected sizes in the depths without the aid of the sun.
instead of using light to create organic material photosynthesis, microorganisms at the bottom of the food chain at hydrothermal vents used chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis.
at the seafloor, there are thriving ecosystems that receive energy not from the sun, but from the heat and chemicals provided by the planet itself.
for many thousands of species dwelling in the deep, the energy to sustain life does not flow down from above, but comes up from the interior of the earth.
even in the unlikely scenario where every single tree were chopped down, we would still be able to breathe thanks to aquatic plant-life ex. algae.
the earth has a tremendous amount of water, and these oceans, rivers, and lakes are teeming with numerous species of biologically active, oxygen-producing organisms.
are there any known sources of sustenance available that could provide for a large human population?
what evidence is there that a sustainable biosphere could exist miles below the surface, totally isolated from the nourishment and the established life cycle provided by the sun?
where are the entrances to inner earth, and which races live inside?
author and anthropologist, robert sepehr , explores these questions and attempts to unlock their riddles, which have eluded any consideration in mainstream academia.
numerous endeavors have been undertaken to access the interior of the earth.
polar expeditions and battles, such as operation highjump, still remain largely classified, and have been shrouded in secrecy for decades, but scientific revelations validating the rumors surrounding these covert events, and their implications, are finally being exposed to daylight.
what are the mysteries of inner earth?

"jesus christs burial slab uncovered during restoration posted by eddie a burial slab believed to have held the body of jesus christ before he was resurrected has been uncovered for the first time in centuries by a restoration team in jerusalem. the original limestone shelf, known as a burial bed, was exposed during the restoration of the church of the holy sepulchre after being covered by marble since at least 1555 a.d. it will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of christ was laid, fredrik hiebert, an archaeologist involved in the discovery, told national geographic . according to scripture, jesus christ was laid on the shelf in the tomb after dying at the crucifixion around 33 a.d. after three days his remains were discovered to be missing and jesus was said to have appeared over a span of 40 days before ascending into heaven. the discovery was made by a team of scientists from the national technical university of athens ntu who were making restorations to the edicule  little house , a structure which had been built around the tomb. researchers now hope to study the original surface to better understand the original tomb and how it evolved to become one of the most sacred sites in christendom. we are at the critical moment for rehabilitating the edicule, chief scientific supervisor professor antonia moropoulou told national geographic. the techniques were using to document this unique monument will enable the world to study our findings as if they themselves were in the tomb of christ. the newly-uncovered surface was described as having a grey-beige stone surface. also known as the church of the resurrection, its custody is shared between six christian sects including the greek orthodox church, the roman catholic church and the armenian orthodox church, whom together invited the ntu to undertake the restoration. at a cost of us4 million, 3.7 million the restoration was not cheap, with major donors including jordans king abdullah ii and mica ertegun, widow of atlantic records co-founder ahmet ertegun. from around the web founder of worldtruth.tv and womansvibe.com eddie  8899 posts

even as the heat continues to rise on donald trump due to his extensive connections to the russian government and other russian entities, new revelations are coming out of the woodwork. senator harry reid has revealed that the fbi has been investigating the russian hackers for months whose actions benefited trumps campaign. and now a group of respected computer scientists has uncovered the secret computer server that trump has been using to coordinate with the russians. 
the group of computer scientists, whose work has been verified by slate and vouched for by other members of the cybersecurity community, initially thought they might have uncovered russian malware. but in studying the specific patterns of data flow, they instead determined that it represented two way communication. while they cant be certain, their belief based on studying the data patterns is that these communications are emails. another outside computer scientist was asked to verify the evidence, and he confirmed that it did indeed represent human-level communication. 
so just whom has donald trump been privately coordinating all this time? alfa bank, the largest bank in russia. 
this falls in line with the months-ago admission by donald trump jr. that his father has taken on a growing and disproportionate amount of investment read debt from the russians since he entered the presidential race. couple that admission with this new revelation that trump has been secretly coordinating with the russians to whom hes suddenly become so egregiously in debt, and it becomes clear why senator reid has outed the ongoing secret fbi investigation in question. read the extensive slate investigation into donald trumps russian server. if you enjoy daily news bin, consider making a contribution contributed by daily news bin staff 776",40,736269,fake

"the fed failed . and that changes everything by jeffrey snider, alhambra investment partners 
there is a growing body of public work that suggests federal reserve officials are prepared now for a very different sort of normalization than what had been envisioned up until this year. that comes, as noted earlier , with the realization that the economy is not just in rough shape but likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future . 
the important caveat left off that bleak pronouncement is actually ceteris paribus . so long as the current policy and monetary system remains firmly in place, there is little hope the global economy will just spontaneously ignite. since economists and central bankers have made it clear they arent going anywhere despite being wrong about everything up to now, here we are. 
even janet yellen has been forced to concede that even if the fed does manage to get on with further rate hikes, the ultimate destination for them in nominal terms is much less than prior cycles. current thinking seems to be aiming for around 3 for the federal funds rate rather than 5 as had long been accepted. the way things are going, and as the japanese showed , they will be lucky to get even half that far. 
but in what can be only another sign of just how twisted, upside down, and easily receptive to pretzel logic the mainstream is now, that is supposed to be a good thing especially for stocks. writing today for bloombergview , mohamed el-erian, chief economic advisor for allianz, makes this exact argument . 
equity investors have also been reassured by the growing  and correct  recognition that this fed hiking cycle will depart drastically from historical norms. instead of following a relatively linear path of increases at regular intervals, it will have pronounced stop-go characteristics. also, and perhaps more importantly, the endpoint  or what economists call the neutral rate  will be considerably lower than recent historical averages. 
how in the world is that a good thing that would reassure equity investors ? truly rational investors make decisions based on discounted information about the future, and what el-erian suggests here and he hasnt been alone is that stock investors show more preference for accommodative monetary policy than actual growth. a lower rate ceiling implies without much ambiguity continued awful economic conditions here and elsewhere around the world. but to the screwed up nature of mainstream thought, so long as monetary policy is lower overall continued stagnation is forgiven, perhaps even to be mildly celebrated? 
what does it mean by claiming accommodation that gives investors so much apparent comfort? it cant mean that in economic terms for obvious reasons; instead we are led to believe that low meaning desperately insufficient growth isnt all that bad so long as interest rates dont rise too far. investors are supposed to be paying for growth , not the failure of interest rate stimulus to seed it. if the fed feels it cant raise rates all that much, with a true ceiling yet to be determined, it is a much riskier , not less risky, environment. 
the idea of a lower r or r-star is truly a defining defeat, though it is, like el-erians attempt here, being spun into what is nothing more than rationalization . as i wrote in september , the falling r-star can mean nothing else 
there is more complexity when we talk about inflation, of course, but by and large it is commodity prices that have thwarted john williams or janet yellens normalizing narrative. commodities have been falling more intensely since the middle of 2014 but really dating back to the middle of 2011. both of those inflections recall and are related to obvious eurodollar or global wholesale money events. thus, even subscribing to wicksells theory, the current rate must now be, as it has been, above the natural rate, unambiguously indicating tight money. whether it is via friedmans interest rate fallacy or wicksells natural rate hypothesis, both arrive at the same conclusion due to seemingly intractable market prices. 
central banks assume that means they have to stimulate more when in fact it is just their math telling them they havent stimulated at all  at least not where it counts and has been needed. translating depression into econometrics is a long and costly affair, but it is at least starting to be done, slowly and in discrete pieces. r may yet be of some great value, insofar as further calculating just how little monetary authorities know about money. 
reception of and belief about qe have been very much cult-like and it was thus too thinly constructed to withstand being so thoroughly debunked. this is not even close to making the best of a bad situation; it is instead claiming positive attributes that just dont exist, being downright offensive to common sense. how anyone, let alone el-erian, wrote that paragraph contained within an article further rationalizing the latest of the rising dollar without awareness of its very basic flaw can at best be described as intentionally obtuse while still bordering upon nakedly deceiving. the world of the near future is going to be bad, worse than everything we have been expecting, but take heart, the feds monetary policy will reflect just that . translating it from the original mainstream thought-bubble language truly reveals its truly absurd premise the fed failed, and that changes everything; including and especially what is to be made of accommodation and what it is that might have reassured equity investors in the past and might do so or not going forward.",230,736266,fake
"early voting is so strong for democrats that clinton could lock up nevada this week on meet the press, clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that early voting is so strong for democrats in nevada that hillary clinton could build an insurmountable lead this week.

chuck todd asked mook if he believed the email story could cost clinton the election. 
he answered 
i dont think so. look, as i said, we have over 50,000 volunteers out there. were seeing record early voting numbers in north carolina, florida. look, i would wager in nevada turnout is so strong among democrats there hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in nevada. were feeling really good about this record turnout. over 200 million people in our country now registered to vote. fifty million of those are young people. were just nose to the grindstone, and were going to finish this out. but people should not take anything for granted, and were going to have to work hard to earn this. 
hillary clinton could put nevada out of reach for trump this week, but whether or not that happens is up to the voters. if democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states, the email story wont matter. if democrats dont show up, that is trumps only chance of winning. 
the early voting numbers that hillary clinton is running up in florida, north carolina, and nevada are no accident. clinton and the democratic party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states. 
democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the 2016 election, but donal trumps refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area. 
the final week before the election could be just as vital to democrats in swing states as election day. if hillary clinton piles up big margins in early voting, it could leave minimal drama for election night. 
the democratic early voting plan is working to perfection, now as mook said, all that is left is for democrats to put their heads down, work hard, and close the deal.

many u.s. muslims prefer sharia law 
washington d.c.  usa  president elect, donald trump has today made his plans for muslims in america known to reporters. 

donald trump visited the white house today to meet with outgoing president barack hussein obama on plans for the transference of power. to say the meeting was edgy and cold would be an understatement. 
trumps landslide victory at the recent u.s. elections caught many off guard, and liberals are all still in deep shock that their delegate hillary clinton was not elected. 
after the meeting at the white house, when asked about muslims, trump was at first hesitant about revealing his plans, but then answered emphatically that muslims are a danger to the national security of the nation. 
no sharia 
i have already spoken in depth about muslims. our solution will be humane and just. their religion is abhorrent and cannot be trusted. we cannot trust muslims in our cities, our streets, our jobs. look what happened in the san bernardino shooting or the orlando massacre? these atrocities were all committed by muslims on u.s. citizens going about their daily lives. we cant have this savagery amongst us. thats why im calling for every muslim to be registered in a database. we need to find out who the devout ones are, who the others are. we need to know if they own guns, and we need to stop their permits. we need to know and watch every muslim in this country, and when the time comes i will make the final decision. we need to detain them until all the attacks stop. detain or deport. well give them a choice. lets not forget their mosques either, shut them down, we can and will do that. they have no place in america, a christian god loving country. 
another reporter asked about muslims who wish to visit the united states. 
its common sense. we have no choice. there is already a no-fly list in place for known terrorists and criminals. our policy in the name of homeland security will be that all muslims are potential terrorists. until the war of terror is over, this will be our policy. they can go and visit some other country, but muslims will not be welcome in america while i am president. 
as reporters rushed to ask further questions, trump halted them and moved on with his entourage.

breaking news from venezuela  the american puppet henrique capricious capriles along with his friends in the venezuelan congress are attempting to engineer a political coup against president nicolas maduro. after years of attempting to oust the late bolivarian president hugo chavez, the foreign owned opposition continue to harass his successor. the model which the venezuelan insurgents seek to ape is that of brazil which recently used congressional powers to remove the democratically elected president dilma rousseff. 
the move will likely fail, but it does demonstrate two important things. first of all, it shows how the right-wing forces in latin america, so determined to push for us domination of their own countries, will stop at nothing to get their way, up to and including a total disregard for democracy. 
secondly, it demonstrates that under barack obamas incompetent leadership, america can no longer control the destiny of the latin american countries that washington used to reign over like obedient right wing clients. latin america is clearly going its own way from ecuador to venezuela to uruguay. the way latin america is choose is that of the left. 
even brazils putative western puppet, the unelected michel temer hasnt broken off his relations with the brics to which brazil gives its first letter, in spite of many hopes in the west that he would do. from manilla to caracas, america is losing her erstwhile colonial playground. whats more is that whilst the current venezuelan congress has been publically accused of buying votes, the election of president maduro has been approved as democratically fair by all but the most far-right, agenda observers.

shapiros usual denunciation of political correctness is likely the reason for the gratuitous insult; in october 2015, clemson was plagued by pc when a few students protested clemson dinings ""maximum mexican"" night, tweeting their displeasure with such a ""culturallyinsensitive"" event. clemson senior austin pendergist told campus reform the post-event uproar was ridiculous  this is something that clemson dining has done for years without any sort of backlash. people love the cultural nights in the dining halls. what's next? are they going to take away all potato based food as to not offend students from irish decent? remove the stir fry station so asian-american students don't feel as if they are being misrepresented? when does it end? 
but the administration wound up apologizing for the event; dr. doug hallenbeck, clemson universitys senior associate vice president of student affairs, said the event displayed a flattened cultural view of mexican culture  it is the mission of university housing  dining to create supportive and challenging environments that enrich and nourish lives. we failed to live out our mission yesterday, and we sincerely apologize, adding that the university will continue to work closely with its food service provider to create dining programs that align with clemson universitys core values. 
the administration also apologized on the clemson dining services facebook and twitter pages. 
pendergist said the event had only featured a couple balloons, sombreros, and some tacos, adding, for as long as i've been here, and probably for much longer, clemson dining has put on certain culinary theme nights, where they decorate the dining halls and serve whatever kind of food. they have italian night, mexican night, seafood night, midnight breakfast, all kinds of events.",43,736269,real
"our consciousness is part of the material world leave a reply 
dylan harper  the human aura is an electromagnetic field that emits from any living thing. it is comprised of many layers, with each aura layer having its own function or role. an aura is not separate from the physical body but is an extension of it in different composition. 
to compare, the characteristics of planet earth include physical and atmospheric layers. the attributes of each layer are different in likeness, appearance and function; each is an interconnected part incorporating the entity as entirely complete. 
continuing to use the earth as a working example of how the human aura serves to function, its layers interactively exchange information with each other. the layers serve as a system of feedback and can indicate states of health, patterns of activity, stagnancy and warn of forthcoming ailments or disease. 
as the earth becomes more densely polluted, sections of its atmosphere will suggest the presence of ailment. by observing patterns of the wind, temperature, air flow and pressure, it allows for accurate predictions of stormy weather between different zones. our awareness or neglect of this system of feedback can mean the difference between preventive maintenance and a result that is costly in damage. all of this information can be detected through observation of atmospheric changes. 
human auras are similar  the aura layers relay specific feedback between our physical body and its functioning systems, our mental and emotional states of being, and they exchange information with other auras that we interact with. 
using the aura as a more direct way to gauge health has been snubbed in the past because auras were not readily seen or were still thought of by many as mythical apparitions. 
however, present technology now has the capability to detect and record the human energy field, and the existence of auras is becoming more widely accepted as an authentic physiological marvel. 
documented research on the physics of the aura phenomenon has been ongoing since as early as the year 1777. modern notable research carried out by dr. seymon kirlian in 1939, for which kirlian photography has been coined, openly made the controversial claims of their existence, exhibiting photographic proof of auras through his technique of electrophotography. 
more studies were done to further advance our knowledge about what the presence of this energy field means, how it functions and how to analyze what it does. united states scientist, dr. thelma moss, author of the body electric, led uclas parapsychology laboratory during the 1970s to study kirlian photography in an effort to document and explain the aura images that are present in an electrophotograph. 
at present, dr. konstantin korotkov at the russian university, st. petersburg state technical university of informational technologies, mechanics and optics, uses a process called gdv gas discharge visualization, a development in aura detection technology based on the kirlian effect. 
we are developing the idea that our consciousness is part of the material world and that with our consciousness we can directly influence our world, said dr. konstantin korotkov, a professor of physics at st. petersburg state technical university. 
to bridge our understanding of the unseen world of energy, scientific experiments are being carried out using a technique called bioelectrophotography. the assumption is that we are constantly emitting energy. bioelectrophotography aims to capture these energy fields seen as a light around the body  or what some people would call your aura. 
in 1999 the russian academy of science approved korotkovs methods and use of gdv techniques and equipment for use in hospitals and athletic training programs as a means of detecting stress in the body to apply preventative measures. sf source dreamcatcher reality nov. 2016 share this",162,736275,fake

"wikileaks email proves democrats manipulate polls email 

an email published by wikileaks on friday reveals the extent to which democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. 
the 2008 email appears shows democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. 
fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. sample too small otherwise, operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala, campaign chairman john podesta, media matters for america founder david brock, and operative susan mccue. good, begala responded. 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. there is ample evidence that this occurs in democrat-friendly newsrooms. 
hillary clinton has opened up a 7-point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week, the daily mail reported in june. 
""but the weekly tracking poll, from nbc news and the surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more self-identified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the poll's topline result,"" the article noted. 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics. 
polls are a powerful propaganda tool, and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidate's loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on election day. 
""i think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout,"" rand paul said in an interview on wednesday on ""the tom roten show"" out of west virginia.

"concert plus campaign clinton turns to celebrities in homestretch by reuters   716 pm heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, democratic candidate hillary clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states.   
by roberta rampton 
daytona beach, fla. reuters  heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, democratic candidate hillary clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. 
jennifer lopez will headline a free concert for clinton supporters in miami on saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach  and some visual counter-programming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the white house. 
the federal bureau of investigation said on friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into clintons use of a private email system  a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the nov. 8 vote 
celebrity-driven events like the concert can serve as a bit of a distraction from the controversy, said eric kasper, a political scientist at the university of wisconsin-eau claire. 
it is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive, kasper said. 
the jlo concert is the first in a series. next week, clinton will take the stage with jay z in cleveland, and then with katy perry in philadelphia on nov. 5. 
a harvard university poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, clinton is leading republican rival donald trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show the apprentice. 
but turnout is a concern. the exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the white house has soured young americans on politics, reutersipsos polling shows. 
presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said tevi troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book what jefferson read, ike watched, and obama tweeted 200 years of pop culture in the white house. 
campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture, said troy, a presidential historian who worked in the george w. bush white house. 
the events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a groundswell of support behind a candidate  and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. 
it can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance, kasper said.

"christie lost republicans the 2012 election. he may be losing them the 2016 election, too. christie lost republicans the 2012 election. he may be losing them the 2016 election, too. by ben shapiro november 4, 2016 
ambition can be dangerous. not just for the ambitious man or woman, but for the country  for all those who ally with the ambitious person. 
for the last eight years, one of the most ambitious men in politics has been new jersey governor chris christie. hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teachers unions in new jersey  brash language about punching them in the face marked his rise as a political force and an up-and-comer in presidential politics  christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the republican party in two straight presidential elections. 
in 2012, christie was considered and rejected for vice president by mitt romney  but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the republican convention. there, he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders, ignoring romney completely. fox news chris wallace called the speech the most curious keynote speech i have ever heardfor a moment i forgot who was the nominee of the party. 
then, the week before the election, hurricane sandy hit the east coast. while new york governor andrew cuomo told president obama that his presence was unnecessary, christie invited obama to new jersey, then hugged him and took him on a tour of atlantic city, where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies. i cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state, christie said, adding that it was my honor to introduce president obama. christie was, at the time, facing down rumors that then-newark mayor corey booker, who is black, would run against him. as the new york times noted, the scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management  only it was run free of charge. 
obama surged in the final days and beat romney handily. 
fast forward three years. 
christie was running in the republican primaries. hed done nothing much in the polls; his only hope was to somehow do well in new hampshire. he had no support in states like south carolina or nevada, or southern states dominated by support for donald trump, ted cruz, and marco rubio. so, naturally, he used his presence at the debate before the new hampshire primary  a state in which rubio was surging following his iowa showing  to destroy rubio. christie rightly labeled rubio a robotic candidate, rubio repeated himself, christie hit him again  and rubio fell apart in the polling. trump ran away with the state. almost immediately, christie quit the race and fell in behind trump. thanks in large part to christies help, trump won the nomination. 
now, with trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against hillary clinton, christie has struck again this time, two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to bridgegate, the scandal in which the christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local democrat who wouldnt endorse christies re-election bid . this story will allow the media to shift its focus to the trump campaign, since christie is leader of trumps white house transition team. in a tight election, it could be enough to hand hillary the white house. 
so thanks, chris christie.

"dozens of groups call on facebook to end censorship dozens of groups call on facebook to end censorship posted on oct 31, 2016 
by deirdre fulton  common dreams facebook had more than 1 billion monthly active users in the second quarter of 2016.  flickr  cc 2.0  
as facebook comes under fire for its alleged censorship and tracking of activists and protesters, a coalition of more than 70 groups and individuals has demanded the social media behemoth clarify its policy on removing video and other content, especially human rights documentation, at the request of government actors. 
a letter whose signatories include the american civil liberties union aclu, 350.org, color of change, and the indigenous environmental networksent monday cites recent incidents including the deactivation of korryn gaines account, the removal of iconic photographs, reports of suppression of indigenous resistance , continued reports of black activists content being removed, and the disabling of palestinian journalists accounts. 
these instances of censorship clearly point to the gaps in facebooks automation and content guidelines, said nicole carty of the consumer watchdog sumofus, which coordinated the letter. in order to mitigate these issues, facebook must recognize these broader policy failures as human rights and free speech issues. from black lives matter in the united states to journalists in palestine, facebooks lack of transparency has resulted in reports of censorship on almost a weekly basis, which proves that this is not an individualized glitch but a broader policy problem. 
advertisement square, site wide 
at the same time, the letter notes that with the launch of the live-streaming video function facebook live, the site is taking on an increasingly central role in controlling media that circulates through the public sphere. news is not just getting shared on facebook its getting broken there. 
in turn, the letter reads, 
we believe that taking urgent action to increase transparency and protect users is the first step to reaching our shared vision of the world. it is important not only for the integrity of its platform and the trust of its community of users, but also for the future of our media. because the stories that dont get shared are as important as the ones that do. 
social media platforms are increasingly becoming the avenues for free speech, which makes ending censorship by companies like facebook all the more critical, added chinyere tutashinda, national organizer at the center for media justice. we are calling on facebook to create policies that protect the most marginalized voices on their platforms communities of color and low-income communities in the u.s. and across the globe. 
specifically, the letter calls on facebook to make policies about how facebook makes decisions to censor content clear and accessible to the public whether those requests are from third-party agencies or through its algorithmespecially with respect to live broadcasting and journalistic content. create a public appeals platform where users can appeal content censored by facebook. undergo an external audit on the equity and human rights outcomes of your facebook live and content censorship and data sharing policies. refuse to disclose customer content and data to third-party agencies unless required to by law. 
notably, the letter came on the same day that scores of facebook users attempted to use the sites check-in feature as a way to help shield dakota access pipeline opponents by confusing law enforcement. while the fact-checking website snopes largely debunked the strategy , it also quoted representatives from sacred stone camp as saying that they support the tactic, and think it is a great way to express solidarity. tags",207,736269,fake
"trump sets gop fundraising milestone in small-donor contributions republican presidential nominee donald trump has reached a financial accomplishment that no other gop candidate has before.
he has amassed the largest small-donor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the republican party.
zac moffatt, an online fundraising expert, said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate.

romney and sen. john mccain, the 2008 gop nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than trump has in total contributions.
however, trumps campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as 200 or less.
 
in this category, trump has raised more than 78.6 million thus far, based on data from the federal election commission.
in comparison, mccain raised 65.5 million and romney raised 44.8 million by this point in their election races.
while mccain and romney had significant income contributions from other sources, trumps small-donor income makes up 58 percent of his overall funds.
according to opensecrets.org, small donations are a key category because for those below 200 mark the campaigns arent legally required to register personal information on the donor, whereas if the donation exceeds 200 the campaign must give the donors name, occupation, employer and zip code.
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias, trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias you could make an argument that he is the best candidate to refresh the rncs online fundraising database because of the different kind of donor that hes gotten, said vincent harris, a gop digital strategist who did private digital work for trumps campaign.
as of oct. 19, the trump campaign ceased all events meant to raise money for the partys get-out-the-vote effort, electing instead to have trump focus on getting across his final message to voters.
weve kind of wound down, said steven mnuchin, trumps national finance chairman. but the online fundraising continues to be strong.
we have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political events, mnuchin continued. unlike democratic nominee hillary clinton, who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.
this decision has been questioned by some given that clintons campaign has raised 445.4 million, according to opensecrets, which is 226.6 million more than the 218.8 million trump has raised.

the marble covering of the tomb has been pulled back, and we were surprised by the amount of fill material beneath it, said fredrik hiebert, archaeologist-in-residence at the national geographic society, a partner in the restoration project. it will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of christ was laid.",238,736264,real
"retired 4 star general blasts trump for not supporting us troops a retired four-star general called out donald trump as unfit to be president because he has failed to support us troops. 
in a conference call with reporters, gen. john allen ret. said trumps remarks are not only uninformedbut it also directly undercuts the courage and the commitment of our troops. and i took great exception to this. however he feels personally about this operation, he should be encouraging our efforts publicly, rather than disparaging them. 
. 
while trump appears not to understand basic military activities, its not clear to me that hes interested in learning them, either. because there are a number of experts, who i thinkwould advise him otherwise. but he seems to be confident in his knowledge. and that knowledge, i think, reveals a lot about what he doesnt know. 
. 
this kind of rhetoric; this kind of disrespect for our military leadership; this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day  it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be commander-in-chief. 
military experts, like gen. allen, feel compelled to criticize the republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief. 
thanks to donald trump, the republican party has become the party that doesnt support the troops. 
republicans have gone from real america to un-american in record time. 
if a presidential nominee doesnt respect the men and women who risk their lives for the country, then he definitely wont respect the needs of hard working americans.

"the only way to save the world is to save yourself the only way to save the world is to save yourself nov 11, 2016 0 0 
we are not here to save the world. we are here to save ourselves, but in doing so, we save the world.  joseph campbell 
as i write this, some shit is probably going down at standing rock . for anybody awake to the tyranny at hand, the events of the last few months have weighed heavily on our hearts. but the thing people need to remember is this were all native americans. if you were born in the usa, and you love the land you were born on which includes the entire fucking planet, by the way!, you are a native american. you are a native earthling, for shits sake. its all connected. their fight is our fight. skin color is irrelevant. where you were born or where you migrated to is irrelevant. the only thing relevant is this are you for freedom, life, cooperation, and love; or are you for statism, profit, divisiveness, and violence? as derrick jensen said, we are the governors as well as the governed. this means that all of us who care about life need to force accountability onto those who do not. 
the media even the alternative media, mind you is trying to spin this as a land issue, or a native american issue. but its not. this is a freedom versus tyranny issue. this is an anarchy versus statism issue. this is a life versus entropy issue. all land is free. we just need to quit focusing on imaginary lines and think cooperation first, competition second. all human beings are free. we just need to quit being obsequious to state-driven authority and start asking and answering the tough questions. 
the only way to save the world is to save yourself. the only way to save the land from being poisoned is to save yourself from being poisoned and from poisoning the land, yourself. the only way to save the environment from pollution is to save yourself from pollution and from polluting the environment, yourself. in other words the only way to save the crashing plane that is the human race is to put the oxygen mask on yourself first before attempting to put it on anybody else, and especially before attempting to right the plane. the oxygen mask, if you havent gathered already, is a metaphor for health, awareness, and truth. save yourself 
only the individual can rise to the heights of consciousness and awareness. the more you belong to the crowd, the deeper you fall into darkness.  osho 
saving yourself is putting on the oxygen mask of health, awareness, and truth. but what does that mean? it means questioning yourself to the nth degree , to the point of self-interrogation, and then questioning some more. it means psychosocial upheaval. it means getting uncomfortable. it means admitting you are wrong. in short it means pain, existential pain of monumental proportions. 
why is it so painful? because much cognitive dissonance must be navigated. everything that youve taken for granted as a fundamental truth must be turned inside out and given proper scrutiny. after such scrutiny, you will likely find that you were wrong about a great many things. but the only tool you need to weigh yourself against your deep questioning is the following anonymous quote when an honest man realizes that he is mistaken, he will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest. 
the question is do you have the courage to be honest with yourself? because if you honestly choose the moral side of freedom, life, cooperation, and love, then youre going to have to admit that statism provides none of these. it only sells the illusion of these. 
statism is about profit, ownership, divisiveness, and violence. it steals peoples freedom by enforcing, and profiting on, outdated and unjust laws but only if the person believes in the law. it stifles life and human flourishing through calculative debt slavery and by convincing people into believing in an illusory debt. it creates physical divisiveness by drawing imaginary lines in the sand and declaring them borders. it creates psychological divisiveness through xenophobic nationalism and conditioned flag worship, setting up an us-versus-them mentality. when, really, the only us-versus-them mentality that holds any moral weight and intellectual validity is the freedom versus tyranny position. 
statism is tyrannical. theres simply no way to wiggle out of this fact. it teaches authoritarianism and oppression. it teaches the individual to oppress and to tyrannize himherself and others. it teaches people to blindly follow and obsequiously respect authority. it teaches extortion and violence. for if the authority of the state is not obeyed, or its many outdated and immoral laws are not followed, the individual is forced, violently if need be, to acquiesce. comply or die, is what it comes down to. either that or your freedom is taken away from you. 
so, when it comes down to it, saving yourself is, first and foremost, waking yourself up from the spell that statism has over you . and then its breaking that spell. break that particular spell, and freedom is at hand. break that particular spell, and  your  life begins. break that particular spell, and you free yourself to learn how cooperation and love actually work, because you will finally begin taking responsibility for your own shit. no masters. no rulers. that means taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions as a social creature on an interdependent planet. no more leaning on the crutch of authority. no more codependence on the state. saving yourself is choosing freedom. save the world 
the modern hero, the modern individual who dares to heed the call and seek the mansion of that presence with whom it is our whole destiny to be atoned, cannot, indeed must not, wait for his community to cast off its slough of pride, fear, rationalized avarice, and sanctified misunderstanding. live, nietzsche says, as though the day were here. it is not society that is to guide and save the creative hero, but precisely the reverse. and so, every one of us shares the supreme ordealcarries the cross of the redeemernot in the bright moments of his tribes great victories, but in the silences of his personal despair. joseph campbell 
so, youve saved freed yourself from the grip of the state. what comes next? freeing others, of course. but not so fast. just because youre free from the state, doesnt mean the state isnt still there, rearing its ugly head. it is still there, oppressing and extorting. it is still there, tyrannizing and destroying the planet under the guise of progress. its still there, trying to suck you back in. it is still goliath and you are still david. and just because you recognize statism as tyranny and oppression, doesnt mean that others do. remember most people are devoted statists who dont even realize they are statists. yes, the ignorance is that thick. but, i digress 
youve secured your oxygen mask on the crashing plane that is the human race. now its time to start helping others to secure their own masks. the problem here is you cant control other people. and, really, you dont want to. you want people to be free, after all. that means youre going to have to convince them . youre going to have to be creative. youre going to have to use your imagination and come up with novel ways to persuade them into being healthy. yes, sadly it has come to that. the only way to bring health to those who are all-too-well-adjusted to a sick society, is to sell it. 
the real kick in the pants is most people dont want to hear what you have to say. people are wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance. people are caught up in their own state driven conditioning and brainwashing. those cops serving and protecting the enforcement of the unhealthy, unsustainable, climate changing game ender north dakota pipeline , are all wrestling with their own cognitive dissonance, conditioning, and brainwashing. theyre simply losing their own inner battle and coming up with the only thing they know the cowardice and violence of a statist. 
so, it comes down to this what do we those who are already free and have their oxygen mask securely fastened do against the cowardice and violence of the inured statist? we teach. we use our imagination to persuade them away from the unhealthiness of the state and toward the healthiness of freedom. we lead by example, influencing them with our courageous words and our actions. we coax them into freely putting their own oxygen mask on. for we know that volition is paramount if freedom is to be had. force is the way of the state. violence is the way of the state. a free human being helping others to be free must never use force or violence, lest they wish to be a tyrant. an authentically free human being wishes other human beings to be just as authentically free. 
but, and heres the rub, as oliver wendell holmes said, your right to waive your fist ends one inch from my nose. 
this means that when our health and freedom are under attack, we are morally justified to defend ourselves. and so, the most important thing we can do as free people, as individuals who have our oxygen masks securely fastened, is to stand our ground. to protect ourselves. which, by extension, means protecting that which immediately sustains us water, and the land that grows our food. the worst thing we can do is back down and play the pacifist. like derrick jensen said,  love does not imply pacifism. the goliath that is the state will trample all over pacifism. indeed, the road to an unhealthy, unsustainable, immoral, and violent world is paved with pacifism. its paved with people turning a blind eye. its paved with the inaction of people who recognized evil and did fuckall with it. 
at the end of the day, goliath the state is going to be goliath. but goliath is only goliath because people believe in it. we dismantle goliath by convincing people not to give into goliaths unhealthy and unsustainable song and dance. first, we extract ourselves from being goliath by transforming ourselves into courageous davids. then, we attempt to extract others from being goliath. and if we cannot, we stand our ground and point out their cowardice and violence as unacceptable. we draw a line in the sand. we stand our ground. we protect our water. we declare, right in the face of the goliath state, these courageous words by thoreau  i was not designed to be forced. i will breathe after my own fashion. let us see who is the strongest.

"is it possible that saudi king be tried in us courts by jasta law? email 

according to the jasta law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks, it is so likely that saudi king be tried. according to experts, the passing of jasta may cause international chaos. especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute us officials if us do so. 
is it possible that saudi king salman bin abdul aziz being tried for potential liability in events of september 11? the trial is possible by the legislation of jasta. by jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations. 
in late september, united states congress ignored president obamas advice and his veto and passed jasta law, the justice against sponsors of terrorism act. this law made us-saudi relation more chaotic. 
us confederate states expressed concern to jasta legislation 
not just saudi arabia expressed concerns to jasta, us confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the us quasi-sacred treaty with saudi arabia and asked for appealing. france and the netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against usa and its military and diplomacy allies. 
john kerry, united states secretary of state, showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk. a few days ago kerry and adel al-jubeir discussed about the ramifications of jasta and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of us interests. he said there are ways to fix the problem. while experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of america in complaining by circumvent the law. 
even saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system. 
according to hussein ibish, an expert on the persian gulf littoral states, jasta will cause chaos at the international level. 
last september, european union warned other countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity. this threat was an addition written letters to us government. 
also france, the netherlands and the united kingdom representatives discussed about the feedback of this law. the gulf littoral states, turkey, iraq, jordan, pakistan and japan protested against jasta. 
the saudi-us relations in danger of jasta 
bernard haykel, princeton university professor, said if saudi king does not appear in new york court to be interrogated, warrant will be issued against saudi arabia. riyadh and washington relations declined over the past three years especially with obama's policies on syria. jasta shows saudi ruling that obama turned his back to its allies in the middle east, he added. 
riyadh strictly denies his involvement in 911, while 15 of the 19 were from saudi arabia. turki al-faisal, the former head of saudi intelligence, also comments america wants to invade his most loyal friend over the past 70 years. 
jasta law does not refer to saudi arabia. it would allow families of the victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks to sue the perpetrators of the attack.",18,736266,fake

"lights, camera, propaganda! washington's anti-russia campaign invades hollywood - danielle ryan lights, camera, propaganda! washington's anti-russia campaign invades hollywood 
keep those russian baddies coming! originally appeared at rt 
for years the influence of the cia in hollywood was hidden and unacknowledged. now its more of an open secret; not publicized, but pretty easy to read up on if you care. just ask the spy agencys entertainment industry liaison. 
yes, such a thing really exists . 
you see, the cias man in hollywood wants to help actors, authors, directors, producers and screenwriters gain a better understanding of the intelligence agency in order to ensure accurate portrayals of its activities. it even wants to help fire up the neurons and actually give you some good ideas if youre coming up short in that department. indeed, the cia provides inspiration for future storylines and lists them on its website. of course, its all in the interest of creating authentic and balanced portrayals of us intelligence agencies and the us military. and theyre quite busy, too. between 2006 and 2011, the cia public relations office had input into at least 22 film and movie projects. 
in a column for the washington post in 2011, david sirota noted that the pentagon too enlists the help of hollywood for pr purposes when things are going awry and americans are becoming weary of war. movies like top gun in the 1980s and zero dark thirty more recently were made in consultation with the pentagon and white house. the result of thiscreative input for pentagon assistance bargain created an entertainment culture rigged to produce relatively few anti-war movies and dozens of blockbusters that glorify the military and which amounts to government subsidized propaganda, 
the cia has had a hand in creating tv shows like 24, homeland andalias. the americans  an fx show about two russian spies living undercover in the us  was created by a former cia agent, and the agency reportedly approves the scripts for each episode. 
a piece in the guardian in 2008 called the cias involvement in hollywood a tale of deception and subversion that would seem improbable if it were put on screen. of course, its unlikely to be put on screen, given that the agency which provides guidance on cia-related movies ... is the cia. 
enlisting hollywood help with anti-russia messaging 
remember the inspiration for future storylines list mentioned earlier? well, guess what? the liaisons current pick for a possible future movie project is about one ryszard kukliński  a polish colonel and spy for nato who spent years passing secret soviet documents to the cia. i wonder why theyd be interested in that sort of thing right now. it couldnt be anything to do with deteriorating relations between russia and the west, could it? 
it may sound like conspiracy theory, but the 2014 hack of sony pictures entertainment revealed that the the us state department has actively sought out the biggest players in hollywood and tried to enlist their help with what they calledanti-russia messaging for the publics consumption through innocent entertainment. in other words, the government asked hollywood for help producing propaganda  although im sure the state department would call it something nicer. 
richard stengel, the us under secretary for public diplomacy, wrote to sony ceo mark lynton explaining that the government needed help countering both isis and russian narratives and said this wasnt something the state department could do on its own. he suggested convening a meeting of media executives to discuss ideas, content, production and commercial possibilities. lynton responded with a list of media executives at other entertainment companies including disney and fox. its unclear from the emails whether that meeting stengel requested ever happened, but judging by much of the recent entertainment industry output, one might be forgiven for assuming it did. 
negative depictions of russia in american and british news and entertainment media are hardly new  but at least as far as i can tell, theres certainly been an uptick over the past 12-18 months, and it coincides nicely with a major us government-led anti-russia messaging campaign which has also spilled over into much of western print and broadcast media. gratuitous mentions of russia and vladimir putin where they are not necessary are becoming tiresome. for me, the last straw was sitting down to watch bridget joness baby last month and being subjected to an entirely unnecessary and irrelevant subplot about the anti-putin punk band pussy riot and their struggle for free speech. it was the last straw because it was just one more in a long line of useless allusions to big bad russia that seemed to come from nowhere. 
for me, the last straw was sitting down to watch bridget joness baby last month and being subjected to an entirely unnecessary and irrelevant subplot about the anti-putin punk band pussy riot and their struggle for free speech. 
in the netflix political drama house of cards, pussy riot  the real ones this time  got their own cameo alongside evil putin not the real one. but even when there isnt a major storyline attached to russia, somehow the country frequently gets thrown in anyway. russia is still the go-to country when there needs to be a joke about scary or immoral foreigners. there are endless examples. 
in nbcs scandal, one character suggests putin might randomly invade belarus. in cbss madam secretary, one character spews the line i cant go back to russia, its a pigsty. in the recently released movie bad moms, one of the bad moms, protesting something or other which i cant recall, shouts what is this, russia? the short-running show allegiancewas entirely about a russian sleeper cell in the us which was suddenly reactivated and whose members  now fully adapted to blissful life in america  no longer wanted anything to do with russia. how original. 
nbcs blacklist has given us multiple russian baddies and the sitcom 2 broke girls has made its fair share of putin jokes. the third installment of the purge introduced us to a gang of menacing russian murder tourists who take advantage of the annual 12-hour period during which any crime, including murder, becomes legal. i could go on, but you get the idea russians are bad. 
is it all cia influence? is it all the result of the state departmentsanti-russia messaging campaign? not necessarily. while the cia does have huge influence in hollywood on specific projects, many of the random negative references to russia are probably the result of a media information war which naturally spills over into the creative output of writers and directors. many of them probably shouldnt be blamed too harshly. theyre fed a diet of anti-russia messaging through the news media, so its no wonder these kinds of lines end up in their movies and tv shows. 
interestingly, in june, the senate intelligence committee included an amendment to congress annual intelligence spending bill which would require the director of national intelligence to submit reports detailing the relationship between the cia and hollywood. but the senate committee is no doubt less worried about the propaganda effects and more worried about the cia divulging sensitive and classified information to movie directors, as was the case, controversially, with zero dark thirty.

"iraqi christians hold first mass in over 2 years pray for trump to win iraqi christians will pray for donald trumps election victory after they condemned us government for abandoning them to the barbaric terror of islamic state.
the christian community in the latest iraqi town to be freed from isis have opened up about how they were terrorised at the hands of the twisted jihadi militants.
the once-bustling qaraqosh, which boasted of more than 50,000 christian residents, was recaptured from the jihadis last week.
residents who stayed in the town have described how isis told every christian to pay a massive tax, convert to islam or face execution.
those who survived the terror have now voiced their outrage that president obama refused to protect them when iraqs largest christian city fell to isis more than two years ago.
a man in the village said he hopes donald trump  a widely favoured candidate in the town  will bring a different approach to iraqi christians.
he told the camera obama has never helped the christians. in fact, he despises them. in the last 26 months, he has shown he despises all of them.
but we have hope in the new president, trump.

donald trump has previously spoken up about how christians have been left to fend for themselves by the us government.
a catholic priest in the town said the us government led by president obama could have protected us  or at least helped us to protect ourselves.
but unfortunately obama abandoned us, and chose not to get involved.
a young girl wearing a crucifix then added we hope this new guy called trump will help us more than obama did.
last sunday, father ammar took mass in a shelled-out church of the immaculate conception for the first time in two years.

what counts is that we can pray here again
the church, still largely in rubble from the chaotic war, is iraqs largest and used to regularly host more than 3,000 people a week to its sunday mass

"melania trump plagiarized her speech again  and this time from the most ridiculous source possible google pinterest digg linkedin reddit stumbleupon print delicious pocket tumblr 
the stakes were very high for melania trumps big campaign speech, the only one shes given since being very publicly mocked for stealing her best lines from the rnc from none other than first lady michelle obama. unfortunately for the trump campaign, the pressure must have gotten to her. 
she plagiarized again. 
it took less than an hour for people to figure it out, but the source will have people scratching their heads for days. melania, trumps third wife, seems to have lifted portions of her speech from marla maples, trumps second wife. 
while speaking about her experiences as an immigrant, melania said america meant if you could dream it, you could become it. 
tablet magazine writer yair rosenberg, simply put the line into google and saw what came up. it was a direct quote from marla maples given to a magazine in the 90s. melania just plagiarized trump's second wife marla maples. here's the only google results for ""if you could dream it, you could become it"" pic.twitter.comalehuszqem 
 yair rosenberg yair_rosenberg november 3, 2016 
is if you could dream it, you could become it a cliche? sure. is it weird that melania would say the exact same phrase that marla had? definitely. 
however, more damning is what else rosenberg noticed. it's not just the one cliched line, it's that the entire section about parentsopportunities is a ripoff, just like it was by michelle obama  
 yair rosenberg yair_rosenberg november 3, 2016 
its as if melania typed what she wanted to say into google, found the interview by marla maples, and simply made it her speech . 
educator and speechwriter yoni brander pointed out that the odd butchering of the truism if you can dream it, you can be it suggests melania really did lift the section directly from marla  the only other person on record as having screwed it up that way. 3. can dream it, you can become it."" by william a. ward. but the form used bymelania which cuts the beginning of the quote and changes 
 yoni brander yonibrander november 3, 2016 4. changes the tense to ""if you dream it, you could become it a variant that appears in only in one other place- marla maples interview 
 yoni brander yonibrander november 3, 2016 
it is also in line with how melania says she screwed up her rnc speech. she told reporters at the time that she accidentally plagiarized by harmlessly finding passages from other people that spoke to her and using them as her starting point. one of those passages, michelle obamas speech, made its way into the final draft. in the same way, it appears melania plagiarized her husbands ex-wife. 
to which one must conclude that trumps camp is run by an staggering assortment of incompetent buffoons. to screw up one major speech is a goof, to screw up two in a row thats a level of idiocy that is difficult to wrap ones head around. and while melania needs to stop using google to write her speeches, trumps campaign needs to spend five minutes making sure she doesnt steal lines from the candidates ex-wife. its not rocket science.

"trump called edward snowden a traitor, implied he should be executed the daily sheeple  by melissa dykes 
sure, hillary clinton is a banshee nightmare from hell, but that really doesnt mean donald trump is automatically amazing just because literally anything is better than hillary. thats a pretty low bar. 
trump has assured us hell give a lot more power to big brother as if we arent already living in an orwellian nightmare as it is. he has said that he will grow the police state, boost the patriot act, and extend the neverending wars he keeps mentioning iran specifically, because no matter who becomes president, they all know they have to sing that same old which path to persia? tune. once i even heard the man say he expects the nsa to be listening in to all our phone calls guess that makes it okay??? 
ಠ_ಠ 
trump has also called edward snowden a traitor and implied that he should be executed. 
he also banned snowden from miss universe which im sure mustve really broken poor edwards heart. message to edward snowden, youre banned from missuniverse . unless you want me to take you back home to face justice! 
 donald j. trump realdonaldtrump october 21, 2013 
while snowden may be a limited hangout, thats beside the point here. without snowden, we wouldnt have so much hard physical evidence of just how much our constitution has been trampled, our 4th amendment has been run over, and our privacy has been rendered nonexistent in the cybernetic technological control grid we now find ourselves living in. 
how is exposing the tyrannical governments crimes against the people a traitorous act worthy of death? 
and this talk of justice? 
real justice would be someone standing up for the constitution and bill of rights and challenging big brother and the nsa surveillance state, something neither trump nor hillary ever planned to do. 
then again, trump is the same guy who said he would take out the family members of terrorists. do you have a criminal in the family? how would you like to be killed because your family member is a criminal? same logic fail. 
like this government is honest about who the real terrorists even are anyway. come on. if were to believe trump is that naive, he shouldnt go anywhere near the oval office. 
then again, how does the saying go? everyone that would make a truly good president is smart enough to realize theyd never want to be president? not that presidents are really running anything in this country anyway

the man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. 
""get out of my car,"" the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, ""you're gonna pay for my shit!"" one of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. 
the camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, ""beat his ass! don't vote trump! don't vote trump!"" 
the video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive.

a hillary clinton-supporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a 20,000 donation funneled through a belize bank to use in this years presidential election campaign  until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by james okeefes project veritas action. 
suddenly, the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donations overseas origin and decided to return it. 
thats one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by okeefe called rigging the election. 
okeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with bob creamer, who was a staffer at americans united for change, a group supporting clinton for president, until the videos started appearing last week. 
he said creamer, who boasted of working directly for the clinton campaign, directed that the 20,000 donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops. 
okeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves. 
creamer was clear about his ties to clinton, stating, every morning i am on a call at 1030 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters. 
sign the precedent-setting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton! 
project veritas first video explained how the clinton campaign uses hidden connections to incite violence at donald trump rallies. its second video showed plans for step-by-step voter fraud and the third exposed prohibited communications between hillary clintons campaign, the dnc and the nonprofit americans united for change. 
the fourth video breaks down the process of the long-term investigation. it comes after creamers announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. 
okeefe and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission. 
among the revelations in the latest video was creamer was boasting of his close links to president obama. 
oh, barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics, i mean the second one, i mean the first was good, too. i was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect, he said. hes a pro, ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago. 
when asked whether a potential donor could meet obama, creamer said ok, you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in 98 days, 97. i was just at an event with him in chicago, friday of last week, he is just as good as ever. i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues, helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. i mean, for immigration reform for the  the health care bill, trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues. 
explained project veritas the more that was promised to creamer, the more access project veritas action journalists seemed to get. project veritas actions 20,000 investment paid off. the story was solid. robert creamer, scott foval, jenna price from the dnc, brad woodhouse from aufc, cesar vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous pva videos. 
in the first video, foval, a democratic operative, boasted of what he called conflict engagement, or sending protesters to disrupt trump events. 
were starting anarchy here, he said. and he needs to understand that were starting anarchy. 
in the second video, creamer explained clintons direct control over those disruption operations. 
in the end it was the candidate, hillary clinton, the future president of the united states, who wanted ducks on the ground, so by god we would get ducks on the ground, creamer said. 
creamer, the husband of democratic rep. jan schakowsky of illinois, has starred in several of the undercover videos. 
heres the third 
that video also revealed a direct conflict between what creamer was confirming  clintons active involvement in such decisions and campaigns  and the claim of her campaign manager, robby mook. 
mook told cnn over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and clinton. 
sign the precedent-setting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton! 
these individuals no longer have a relationship with the dnc, he said. theyve never had a relationship with the clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened i think in february of last year. 
they did not have a contract with the dnc until june. but putting all that aside, this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign, it is edited so we dont know what the full context is. and theres no evidence whatsoever  that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the dnc. 
his comments 
after confirming it was clinton or wanted ducks on the ground, creamer warned undercover project veritas journalists, dont repeat that to anybody. 
creamer ran democracy partners, a consulting company with ties to clinton. 
he has been to the white house 342 times while obama has been president, including 47 meetings directly with obama. 
okeefes organization reported that the coordination between the campaign, the dnc and the americans united for change smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures. 
last week , project veritas filed a complaint with the federal election commission asking for an investigation into the clinton campaigns criminal conspiracy. 
the filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means, such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally. 
the video have resulted already in two democratic operatives losing their jobs. 
editors note be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos. 
one is scott foval, who had worked for people for the american way, a george soros-funded group, and more recently with americans united for change. 
in the video, he said you know what? weve been busing people in to deal with you fing aes for 50 years, and were not going to stop now. 
also, he said he and his agents are starting anarchy by creating conflict engagement  in the lines at trump rallies. 
also out of work is creamer. 
see the second video 
talk-radio icon rush limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome. 
every trump rally would feature none of this violence unless the democrats were paying for it. i think its a big deal, folks. the media is complicit. they know who these people are.  theyre in on it. theyre part of the game.  none of its organic. none of its natural. none of its real. every bit of it is bought and paid for. 
democrats cant leave elections to chance because they know that, despite the way it may look, the majority of americans would not support them if they knew who they are.

in june the uk shocked the world  or at least the worlds elites  by voting to pull out of the european union. economists predicted disaster, eu leaders threatened pain for british exporters and tourists, and the media settled in to watch the uk shrivel and die.

"ron paul blame government, not markets for monopoly ron paul blame government, not markets for monopoly 11012016 
eurasia review 
when time-warner announced it planned to merge with another major communications firm, many feared the new company would exercise near-total monopoly power. these concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both time-warners competitors and consumers. 
no, i am not talking about time-warners recent announced plan to merge with att, but the reaction to time-warners merger with then internet giant aol in 2000. far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all competitors, the aol-time-warner merger fell apart in under a decade. 
the failure of aol-time-warner demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace. aol-time-warner failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices andor better quality. 
corporate mergers and hostile takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors. these managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with affordable, quality products. thus, laws making it difficult to launch a hostile takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm investors, workers, and consumers. 
monopolies and cartels are creations of government, not markets. for example, the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees. similarly, anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal regulations, they must sign a franchise agreement with their local government. fortunately, the internet has given americans greater access to news and ideas shut out by the government-licensed lapdogs of the mainstream media. this may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web. 
government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry. large companies can afford the costs of complying with government regulations, costs which cripple their smaller competitors. big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business. 
examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the food and drug administrations fda regulations that raise costs of developing a new drug, as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals. another example is the dodd-frank legislation, which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors. 
legislation forcing consumers to pay out-of-state sales tax on their online purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less politically-powerful competitors. this legislation is being pushed by large brick-and-mortar stores and internet retailers who are seeking a government-granted advantage over smaller competitors. 
many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the federal reserves inflationary monetary policy. perhaps the most famous example of this is the aol-time-warner fiasco, which was a direct result of the fed-created dot.com bubble. 
in a free market, mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices. any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices andor higher quality. monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of well-connected crony capitalists. therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the regulations, taxes, and subsides that benefit politically-powerful businesses. the most important step is to end the boom-bust business cycle by ending the federal reserve.

"women only hate female objectification when they can no longer profit from it with her hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up, former charmed actress and constantly near-naked attention-seeker rose mcgowan is now a leading feminist. as you would expect, this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of co-star alyssa milano had well and truly begun to fade. mcgowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift. pamela anderson and professional sjw natasha devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying, often very successfully, to sexualize their youth.
seeking to cash in on her new-found fame as an unhinged sjw, rose mcgowan launched the rose army, a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification. full sjw mode is just a button away for her. for instance, she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and, probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity, claimed an x-men movie poster promoted violence against women .
so now comes the task of reconciling the new rose mcgowan with the old one, whose self-objectification is best described by this infamous photo with ex-boyfriend marilyn manson

excuses, excuses rose mcgowan has tried to gloss over her past history of self-objectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy.
mcgowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds, such as with a fellow charmed actress, shannen doherty, on patriarchy, sexism and female objectification . sadly, this very public attention-seeking, in which mcgowan wrote doherty an open letter, comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer . but, you know, a girls gotta attention-whore, including when another girl she used to have cat-fights with is about to die.
rose mcgowan has a lot in common with pamela anderson. ex- playboy cover model anderson, after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship, has now come out against pornography . she may not be bad for a gal nearing 50, but her best years are a good 20-25 years behind her. i would wager that pamela anderson hit 45 and spent the last several years in denial, before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her. pornography addictions are bad, but anderson showing these new colors in 2016 is nothing short of a joke.
andersons position can be summed up by the following two pictures
time when she did not condemn pornography 

time when she condemns pornography 

previously, a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists. these activists are nominally against the sexualization of women, but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females. whilst there is a lot of truth to this, it only tells part of the story. the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle. and what better time to turn on these industries, whether they be the pornography, film, or modeling markets, than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them?
this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization . attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing on-court clothing, which is much more for show than practicality. but when the chance presents itself, lisicki and others have moaned, like at this years wimbledon , about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin. many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet, but they pick and choose when objectification is bad, just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them.
its not just famous people natasha devon.
many return of kings readers will remember natasha devon from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion mannequins. there seems to have been an eerie timing in devons transition from self-described former model to sjw. she founded a so-called body image education program in 2006, in her mid-twenties. i dont know about you, but this seems to be the sort of age when non-famous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger, fresher girls.
as she hurtled towards 30, natasha devon penned an article for cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia, which morphed into a regular monthly column. then came the self-esteem team devon created in 2012. frequently with government funding, the self-esteem team has essentially applauded obesity, britains number one health crisis, and sought to re-engineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive.
devon, along with anderson and mcgowan, may chalk an anti-objectification epiphany down to age, experience or something similarly convenient, but the changes happened neither at the height of their self-sexualization careers nor during the pre-wall protracted slide. always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism.
when a woman complains about the objectification of women, it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with, b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls, or c her goods are well and truly gone. there is a delicious irony to option c, as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a half-decade of alcohol or drug-fueled benderstakes them away.
feminism as projection 
it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs. of anyone, roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most, all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings say.
we need to turn this idea of projection against feminists, even more than we have before. modern-day feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh, uncertain world. for women whose looks are now washed-up, feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to.
rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil, it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant.

"freedom rider russophobia war party propaganda tweet widget b y bar editor and senior columnist margaret kimberley 
the worlds most reactionary regime, the head-chopping, terror-sponsoring saudi arabian kleptocracy, was awarded the chair of the un human rights council, while russia has been kicked out. the travesty was engineered by the superpower of lies to punish moscow for resisting the u.s.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in syria. the war party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media  and hillary hasnt even been elected yet. freedom rider  russophobia war party propaganda b y bar editor and senior columnist margaret kimberley 
 all attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the u.s. and nato and sealed the fate of the syrian people. 
did russia invade iraq and kill one million people? does russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? did russia occupy haiti after kidnapping its president? are russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? is russia entering its 20 th year of a terror war against the people of somalia? all of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the united states. yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to america in violating human rights. 
the dangers presented by a hillary clinton presidency cannot be overstated. she and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against russia. 
nearly every claim of russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. it isnt clear if clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. perhaps they believe that vladimir putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary. 
 regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against russia. 
the unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on russia as the sole cause of suffering in syria are meant to desensitize the public. it is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. the usual suspects are helping out eagerly. the corporate media, led by newspapers like the new york times and washington post , are front and center in pushing tales of russian villainy. human rights watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the united states and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim. 
russia lost its seat on the united nations human rights council in part because of american pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. the unhrc is now chaired by saudi arabia. saudi arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 syrian deaths. the saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in yemen, too, but they are american allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds. 
the openly bigoted donald trump has been the perfect foil for hillary clinton. that is why she and the rest of the democratic party leadership preferred him as their rival. he made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with russia made him even more useful. 
 newspapers like the new york times and washington post, are front and center in pushing tales of russian villainy. 
the united states and its allies are the cause of syrias destruction. their effort to overthrow president assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with isis and al nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. far from being the cause of the catastrophe russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. they even made overtures to negotiate assads fate with the united states. all attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the u.s. and nato and sealed the fate of the syrian people. the people of east aleppo are being shelled by american allies but one wouldnt know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. the american role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. the bloodshed was made in the u.s. and could end if this government wanted it to. 
the anti-russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. nato is massing troops on russias borders in a clear provocation yet putin is labeled the bad guy. he is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. the united states makes phony claims of russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. the latest human rights watch canards about prosecuting assad come straight from the white house and state department and have nothing to do with concern for syrians living in their fifth year of hell. 
donald trump has been the perfect foil for hillary clinton. 
there is no lesser evil between hillary clinton and donald trump. she is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more muscular foreign policy. that bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if clinton wins in a landslide. she must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. peace loving people must give their votes to the green party ticket of jill stein and ajamu baraka. they are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars. 
the united states is the most dangerous country in the world. if it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. that is the prospect we face with a hillary clinton presidency. if the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the show. margaret kimberley's freedom rider column appears weekly in bar, and is widely reprinted elsewhere. she maintains a frequently updated blog as well as at  ms. kimberley lives in new york city, and can be reached via e-mail at margaret.kimberleyatblackagendareport.com.",25,736270,fake

"19 men cry rape by iran's top quran reader print saeed toosi, right, and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal, the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping 19 of his students and charged with advocating corruption. 
saeed toosi, 46, winner of the first prize for reading the quran, both internationally and locally, fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi, reported al arabiya. 
in an audio recording, toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and, together with the head of irans judicial authority, had agreed to a cover-up to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime. 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts. the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a much-needed dose of truth about the religion of peace. 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake. one of the victims  a recent first-place winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was 12 while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition. the mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. 
all victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions. 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei, current supreme leader of iran. he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan. last may, toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council, with many of irans top officials in attendance. 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man. 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality, sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture, causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced. the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic. 
according to the reformist amad news, officials held a two-hour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast. the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged. 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani, whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents, defended the regimes handling of the case, london guardian reported. larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story, so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not. 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling, though there will be no public trial. awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation. 
toosi, who has denied the charges against him  calling them total lies meant to discredit irans religious institutions and the ayatollah  is reportedly threatening to release the names of 100 of irans top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children, if the prosecution proceeds.",238,736264,real

"far worse than the fourth reich  the day of reckoning has arrived! with a supplemantry note by lasha darkmoon on the transhumanist depopulation agenda we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january 20, 2017. their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief. the day of reckoning has arrived.  vid rebel i never said i supported donald trump because i liked where he wanted us to go. i did say i was interested in the anger of the bernie sanders and donald trump voters. on election night a bbc reporter tried to explain how hillary lost that state which has a huge black vote and lots of technically advanced people from out of state in what americans call research-triangle park. obama went there in a last ditch effort to get out the vote. he was popular there amongst the college students. they had voted for him in 2012 but not so much for hillary in 2016. the bbc reporter told us the people who lived there said they were all bernie voters. they had zero enthusiasm for hillary. 
i previously quoted mike rivero who had said that if hillary clinton were running in november against godzilla, the lizard would have his vote. we have seen the hillary kool-aid drinkers go crazy after donald won. they all live in bubbles where it would have been career suicide to say you voted against hillarys pay for pay corruption. 
i have seen a lot of domestic anti-trump propaganda from the far right because donald is a zionist. i agree with donald that we should stop funding isis and let vladimir putin take them down. it was obama who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in 2014 and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria. but i do disagree with donalds intention to confront iran. for what? resisting zionism? 
but fortunately for iran, what trump and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant. of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states. 
i have just now seen from europe sheer post-election idiocy. some are claiming that donald trump is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the same industrialists and money men that had elevated adolf hitler to the chancellorship in 1933. 
it is silly to think that the rockefellers and the rothschilds backed trump. 
i do admit that america is run by a criminal elite. i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given donald a green light to dish out dirt on hillary. these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought hillary was one witch too far to go. 
i have reported on the elite end game many times before. their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief. far worse. 
the people who had owned the governments in the west until recently were the 30 families and their 6,000 minions. that is according to david rothkopf, the former ceo of kissinger associates and author of superclass. 
fortunately for us, the people of the us and europe are learning to resist. 
i voted once in a presidential election where the democrat was a member of the trilateral commission headed by david rockefeller in north america and sir evelyn de rothschild in europe. the republican was a member of the bilderberg society headed by sir evelyn de rothschild in europe and headed by david rockefeller in north america. you never read that in our corporate media. 
please do not call those people who run hollywood and our tv news nazis. they are either jewish or work for jewish companies.the direct ties of those who thought they were born to rule over us are more to banking than to industry. they are not nazis.    the transhumanist depopulation agenda ld  in a breakthrough interview on the transhumanist agenda and the 2016 presidential election, catherine austin fitts, former us assistant housing secretary and publisher of the solari report, spoke of the engineered rise of autism, gmo proliferation, the expansion of entrainment technology, the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics, and the dumbing down of american students with common core. see here . these were all, she argued, part of an overarching conspiracy to promote a massive transhumanist depopulation agenda. this would be achieved by an engineered economic armageddon, leading to mass starvation, food riots and race wars that would wipe billions of people off the face of the planet. how soon this apocalyptic scenario is likely to unfold is anyones guess. any moment now, many doomsayers declare. the coming of donald trump is regarded by many as an omen of the end days. ld vid rebel continues 
catherine austin fitts said the bankers stole 50 trillion from us. i think they stole a lot more. 
the bankers gave themselves the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing in 1694 when they founded the bank of england. america copied the bank of england and the german central bank when they drafted the legislation for the federal reserve in 1910. it became law in 1913 just in time for america to create enough unpayable debt at interest to fund ww i. 
the united states entered ww i because the elite did not want the allies to accept germanys offer to stop the fighting in 1915. the elite wanted the war to last long enough to bankrupt britain and france, to set up a jewish communist dictatorship in russia and to make palestine a british colony for the jews. none of that benefited voters in europe or america. and the bought and paid for media cannot understand why we despise both them and the 30 families that sent them. 
we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january 20, 2017. 
the elite stole all of our pensions and savings. they sold hundreds of trillions in bad bets otherwise known as credit default swaps just so they could pocket tens of trillions of dollars in premiums. dont cry for them. they made people like you i.e. taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions. just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund, your savings, your bank account and your paycheck. their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future. at least, that is what they are planning. 
the bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt. the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing. you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing. 
if we had lincolns non-interest bearing greenbacks, we would not have 20 trillion in national debt and be paying 500 billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest. 
the recent sharp rise in the interest rate on 30 year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse. 
a depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse. since we foolishly have a debt based system, that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court. it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment. 
i have quoted dr steve keen many times before. we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past 500 years. 
so what is worse than the fourth reich? tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat. 
in short, a race war to end all wars. 
of course this is what americas elite had planned for them. they stole all of the pension funds and the savings. they created the trade deals that closed 58,000 manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas. they added 55 million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration. they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire 30.6 million federal, state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work. they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning. 
the day of reckoning has arrived. 
the 30 year treasury bonds interest rate at 3 is at record highs for recent years. that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us. it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long. 
the only exit path i see, is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country. 
and the junior officers in the military must respond by arresting bankers and seizing their assets to fund debt cancellation. 
only debt cancellation will provide a painless way out of the coming financial collapse.",44,736289,fake

"is goat milk better than cow milk? plus a list of health benefits in general health while cows milk remains one of americas most common daily drinks, it is interesting to note that it may also be the reason why many americans experience gas , bloating and other forms of indigestion. when the average cow is given growth hormones, antibiotics, gmo feed, vaccinations and exposed to toxic conditions, it is no wonder that many humans experience negative effects from consuming pasteurized cow milk . goats milk is a much healthier alternative, especially when it is raw and organic. goats produce about 2 of the global milk supply and it is interesting that most of the populations of people who consume goat milks cite a lower incidence of allergies and digestive complaints. the benefits of goat milk goats milk offers a wide variety of health benefits, with very few of the negative side effects of drinking regular cow milk. 1. reaction to inflammation some research suggests that one of the main benefits of goat milk is that it may benefit inflammation. another reason why it is easier for people with bowel inflammation to drink goats milk, instead of cows milk. 2. environmentally friendly goats requires far less space and food than cows. typically, you can comfortably raise six goats on the same acreage as two cows. 3. metabolic agent studies done at the usda and prairie view am university, link goats milk to an increased ability to metabolize iron and copper, especially amongst individuals with digestion and absorption limitations. besides drinking goats milk, you can also take a digestive enzymes supplement to help with this also. 4. bio-availability another main health benefit of goat milk, is that it is closer to human mothers milk than cows milk is. because it has a chemical make up that is much closer to human milk, it is easier to digest and assimilate in the human body. 5. smaller fat smaller fat? does that mean it has less fat? not necessarily, it means that the size of the fat molecules in goats milk are much smaller than those found in cows milk. this makes goats milk easier to digest. 6. high in fatty acids while cows milk has about seventeen percent fatty acids, goats milk averages thirty five percent fatty acids, making it more nutritionally wholesome. in fact, up to 50 of people with lactose intolerance to cows milk find that they can easily digest goats milk, especially if it is raw. 7. calcium-rich many people worry that they need to drink cows milk for calcium intake and the prevention of bone loss. goats milk also offers high amounts of calcium, the amino acid tryptophan, and much less side effects of drinking cows milk. its just one of the many foods high in calcium . 8. anti-mucousal while drinking cows milk is a common reason for allergies and excess mucous, goats milk is not. cows milk is high in fat, which may increase mucous build-up. moreover, the fat globules in goats milk are one ninth the size of those found in cows milk, another possible reason why it does not produce irritation in the gut. 9. ultra-nourishing in naturopathic medicine, goats are referred to as bioorganic sodium animals. they are also associated with vigour, flexibility and vitality. cows are calcium animals known for stability and heaviness. bioorganic sodium is an important element in keeping joints mobile and limber. goat milk has traditionally been used in medicinal cultures to nourish and regenerate an over-taxed nervous system. goats milk is also extremely nutrient dense. it has almost 35 of your daily needs for calcium in one cup. extremely high in riboflavin, just one cup of goats milk offers 20.0 of our daily needs. add to that high amounts of phosphorous, vitamin b12, protein and potassium. in fact, ghandi himself rejuvenated his own health after extremely long periods of fasting through drinking raw goats milk  1  . 10. less toxic than cows milk whereas most cows milk is pumped full of bovine growth hormones as well as a substance known as bovine somatotropin, a hormone specific for increasing milk production in an unnatural way, goats are rarely treated with these substances. because of its use on the fringes of big agriculture, goats milk is not only more nutritious for you, but also less toxic. 11. may boost immune system goats milk has the trace mineral, selenium, a key essential mineral in keeping the immune system strong and functioning normally. why you should drink goat milk over cows milk these are just a few of the many health benefits of goat milk. not only does it contain more nutrients your body craves, but it also has less additives than cows milk. go with the healthier choice. references time magazine. great britain ghandis goat . 1931 november 2. submit your review",195,736263,fake
"shapiro eviscerates raucous protesters at university of wisconsin  daily wire shapiro eviscerates raucous protesters at university of wisconsin by hank berrien november 16, 2016 
daily wire editor-in-chief ben shapiro spoke at the university of wisconsin-madison on wednesday night, and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him, found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium. 
after the ovation he received on entering, shapiro quipped, hey look at this. a campus that doesnt actually try to arrest me when i come. he continued, before i begin, i did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room. i hear youve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how youre not one of these awful, terrible trump people, that youre sensitive, and that you want to signal your virtue, so ive brought along these safety pins, holding up safety pins and i also brought you something to wear them with  this diaper."" 
shapiro then held up a diaper, prompting huge laughs from the audience. 
when a protester yelled at shapiro that he should be wearing a swastika, shapiro held out his yarmulke, then fired back, in case you hadnt noticed, the folks with the swastikas arent too nice to my type. 
shapiro continued, stop being self-indulgent children; stop pretending that everybody who voted for trump is a vicious racist; its your right to protest, of course, but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a duly-held election  donald trump doesnt care about your protest. donald trump is sitting somewhere in trump tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty, salty tears. 
referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who werent university students from attending shapiros lecture, shapiro opined i hear that a lot of folks at this publicly-funded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants. i do have a quick question if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, why are so many people trying to ban american citizens from this community from coming to this lecture? and by the way, im aware of this private facebook page titled f white supremacy interrupting ben shapiro.' with all due respect, f you right back, gang. 
after the applause subsided and shapiro joked about how both black lives mater and the kkk target him, the real fun began. protesters stood up, chanting, shame over and over again. 
shapiro quipped, wow, its like game of thrones . should i get undressed and walk down the aisle? 
the bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters. shapiro addressed the protesters, saying, im happy to talk with you, but they responded by screaming safety over and over. shapiro joked, did somebody fart? the crowd responded to the protesters by chanting, usa. 
shapiro replied, i tell you try not to be children; the first thing you do is start screaming like my two-year-old. he added, you see, this is how conservatives actually treat people; you stand up and you interrupt and you shout safety, and youre perfectly safe. look at that. its amazing. that provoked sustained applause. 
when the protesters started screaming shame again, shapiro eviscerated them, pointing out, if youre going to pick a chant like shame, watch game of thrones first. the bad guys shout shame. the audience loved that line. on a roll, shapiro continued, youre not changing anybodys mind, all youre showing everybody is that your collective iq, if it were channeled into electricity, night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly. 
he continued, okay, can we talk now, or are you going to keep shouting? nows your chance to get it out. lets hear your feelings. cmon. just go for it. or is it going to be like every thirty seconds; like an annoying microwave timer? 
when the protesters resumed chanting, shapiro responded, if you guys want to talk, we can talk, if you want to shout, get the hell out. more applause. 
shapiro fired, for god's sake, at least wait until i say something that offends you before getting offended."" 
shapiro returned to deconstructing the term social justice. when the protesters started again, a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up, and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day, and that they should shut freaking up and listen to the man speak. that prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and shapiro. too. he added, see, thats what a decent, hard-working person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime, presumably. 
shapiro returned to his speech racial diversity doesnt mean anything; decency means everything  diversity isnt our strength; decency is our strength. he turned to the protesters remember that? decency. 
the protesters screamed back, shame! shapiro fired back, decency! the protesters chanted shame but the crowd soon joined shapiro in chanting decency, shutting the protesters up. 
as shapiro spoke of the falsity of white privilege, the protesters formed a line in front of shapiro, prompting him to quip, if you guys are all going to come up here, can we all just have circle time or something? 
the protesters chanted safety for a minute and a half, but then the crowd started yelling back, free speech matters. shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters, morons that again prompted cheering. 
one member of the audience yelled to the protesters, at least tell us what you want, or otherwise, just get out! that brought a sustained ovation. 
after one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue, the protesters started shouting safety again, then filed out, yelling f white supremacy while flipping off shapiro and the entire audience. that prompted the crowd to sing, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, good-bye. it also promoted this from shapiro 
even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door. 
after shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested, as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage, or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event, he continued, all i can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event. 
even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door, prompting shapiro to quip, doesnt this school give homework? does anybody have a job around here? i guess when youre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands. 
shapiro noted that he had engaged in a back-and-forth with one of the protesters, who accused him of being a white supremacist. when he asked her why she thought so, she replied that she got that impression from his image. he fired back, really? was it the yarmulke that did it for you? 
he took another shot at the protesters during the speech, noting that people were born unequal, and adding, some people us are born rich; some of us are born poor; some of us are born smart; some of us are born protesters. 
the rest of the speech was vintage shapiro, as was the qa afterward. even the chalk was impressive

did huma create the âlife insuranceâ folder to use as leverage, just in case her boss, hillary clinton, ever turned on her? or, did anthony weiner create the folder, for his own bargaining options? so did huma steal 10,000 emails and saved it on her comp just in case clinton targeted her?

"george soros funds anti-trump riots similarly to how he funded the ferguson riots does someone behind the scenes want to see civil war in the united states? 
the answer is almost certainly yes. 
and it isnt likely to settle down anytime in the next few days. if you arent prepped for this, go here to learn how to stay safe . 
just a little background this has been going on since the midst of the campaign when actors were hired on craigslist and trained to disrupt rallies. 
for example, one craigslist ad was answered by paul horner, who admitted he was paid 3,500 to cause a scene at a trump event in fountain hills, arizona. 
as for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be hillary clintons campaign, horner said. the actual check i received after i was done with the job was from a group called women are the future. after i was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who i was with or communicated with me in any way, i should start talking about how great bernie sanders is. horner continued, it was mostly women in their 60s at the interview that i went to  source  
the same report goes on to say 
when asked about the other protesters at the rally, horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally. 
almost all of the people i was protesting with i had seen at my interview and training class. at the rally, talking with some of them, i learned they only paid latinos 500, muslims 600 and african americans 750. i dont think they were looking for any asians. women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received 300 across the board. i think i was paid more than the other protesters because i was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back 
you can also read this article , in which a quote caught on video from project veritas shows how the clinton campaign caused disruptions via bird-dogging. theres a lot of evidence that someone is funding these protests. 
an eyewitness in austin, texas spotted protesters being transported by chartered coach buses. 
then there was this craigslist ad. 

there are many more tweets along these lines, but suffice it to say, suspicion is high that these, just like the clinton campaign, are rigged to manipulate the american people. why would anyone want to cause all this trouble? 
thats where the web gets tangled. it certainly seems counterproductive to set fire to america. after all, what these people are doing is likely to end up with more tyranny  like martial law, for example. 
exactly. 
thats precisely the plan. 
back in august, hackers from a group called dc leaks got into the private documents of the open society, an organization founded by george soros. soros, whom dc leaks referred to as the architect and sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years is a pro-globalist billionaire who has been trying to take over the world via shadow government for decades. 
zero hedge reported on the findings in the soros leak 
the documents are from multiple departments of soros organizations. soros the open society foundations seems to be the group with the most documents in the leak. files come from sections representing almost all geographical regions in the world, from the usa, to europe, eurasia, asia, latin, america, africa, the world bank the presidents office, as well as an unknown entity named souk. as the daily caller notes , there are documents dating from at least 2008 to 2016. documents in the leak range from research papers such as  european crisis key developments of the past 48 hours  focusing on the impact of the refugee crisis, to a document titled  the ukraine debate in germany , to an update specific financials of grants. they reveal work plans, strategies, priorities and other activities by soros, and include reports on european elections, migration and asylum in europe. an email leaked by wikileaks earlier this week showed soros had advised hillary clinton during her tenure as secretary of state on how to handle unrest in albania  advice she acted on. 
as well, its important to note that soros provided a whopping 33 million to activists in ferguson, missouri, escalating a protest to a siege. the washington times reported 
liberal billionaire george soros , who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts american politics and policy, not unlike what he did with moveon.org. 
mr. soros spurred the ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the u.s., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by the washington times. 
in all, mr. soros gave at least 33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in ferguson , according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit open society foundations everyday carry gear  11 items you should always have on you ad 
this is business as usual for the osf open society foundation, as explained by director kenneth zimmerman  
mr. zimmerman said osf has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early 90s, and that, although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of mr. soros grants, they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of open society . 
the incidents, whether in staten island, cleveland or ferguson , were spontaneous protests  we dont have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say, mr. zimmerman said. but these circumstances focused peoples attention  and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation. 
soros -sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in ferguson , building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign. 
other soros -funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep, and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive. 
the plethora of organizations involved not only shared mr. soros  funding, but they also fed off each other, using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on anothers website, referencing each others news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of facebook likes and twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds. 
soros was busted for paying protesters to go into ferguson and stir things up. this is not theory. its fact. the daily mail reported that soros spent 33 million to bankroll the protests. the washington times reported that it was totally cool, though, because humanitarian that he is, soros just wanted to help the civil rights movement . what a guy. of course, this seems to be a thing with the kabillionaires. the ford foundation and rockefeller foundation also fund social activism. which is kabillionaire code for mess stuff up and wreak havoc. 
keep in mind that the organization black lives matter was born through the ferguson riots. does this look familiar? 
if the modus operandi in these protests looks familiar, thats because moveon.org is organizing a lot of them, and moveon is funded by you guessed it george soros. the organization was originally founded to combat the impeachment of bill clintonare you seeing a link here? another proud instigator is the answer coalition which also  are you sitting down? has links to soros . 
there are a lot of people who are out there because they genuinely oppose a trump presidency. the unfortunate thing is, their opposition comes from propaganda that they passionately believe. they are acting based on misinformation and theyre being professionally manipulated. 
the next step here is martial law, which nobody wants. 
well, nobody except george soros and friends. 
someone who wants to see america ripped apart is causing this division. last summer, it was leaked that soros attempted to destabilize russia and depose putin in 2012. putin responded by banning soros and all of his organizations from russia. in 2014, putin issued an international arrest warrant for soros. 
we could certainly improve both international relationships and our current situation by extraditing soros immediately.

"why is the foreign policy establishment spoiling for more war? look at their donors - dennis kucinich citizen journalism with a punch why is the foreign policy establishment spoiling for more war? look at their donors 
 war is first and foremost a profitable racket   the nation 
washington, dc, may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo-intellectuality by banding together, declaring themselves think tanks, and raising money from external interests, including foreign governments, to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real-life concerns of the american people. 
as a former member of the house of representatives, i remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular, rococo thinking devoid of depth, reality, and truth. i remember other hearings where the pentagon was unable to reconcile over 1 trillion in accounts, lost track of 12 billion in cash sent to iraq, and rigged a missile-defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target. war is first and foremost a profitable racket. 
how else to explain that in the past 15 years this citys so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in iraq and libya, and interventions in syria and yemen, which have opened pandoras box to a trusting world, to the tune of trillions of dollars, a windfall for military contractors. dcs think tanks should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia. 
according to the front page of this past fridays washington post, the bipartisan foreign-policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than president obama. acting at the urging of liberal hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention, read war, the obama administration attacked libya along with allied powers working through nato. 
the think tankers fell in line with the iraq invasion. not being in the tank, i did my own analysis of the call for war in october of 2002, based on readily accessible information, and easily concluded that there was no justification for war. i distributed it widely in congress and led 125 democrats in voting against the iraq war resolution. there was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for, so, against millions protesting in the united states and worldwide, our government launched into an abyss, with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants. the marching band and chowder society of dc think tanks learned nothing from the iraq and libya experience. 
the only winners were arms dealers, oil companies, and jihadists. immediately after the fall of libya, the black flag of al qaeda was raised over a municipal building in benghazi, gadhafis murder was soon to follow, with secretary clinton quipping with a laugh, we came, we saw, he died. president obama apparently learned from this misadventure, but not the washington policy establishment, which is spoiling for more war. 
the self-identified liberal center for american progress cap is now calling for syria to be bombed, and estimates americas current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on mission accomplished. cap, according to a report in the nation, has received funding from war contractors lockheed martin and boeing, who make the bombers that cap wants to rain hellfire on syria. 
the brookings institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments , notably qatar, a key player in the military campaign to oust assad. retired four-star marine general john allen is now a brookings senior fellow . charles lister is a senior fellow at the middle east institute , which has received funding from saudi arabia , the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend assad and install a sunni caliphate stretching across iraq and syria. foreign-government money is driving our foreign policy. 
as the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder, allen and lister jointly signed an op-ed in the sunday washington post, calling for an attack on syria. the brookings institute, in a report to congress , admitted it received 250,000 from the us central command, centcom, where general allen shared leadership duties with general david petraeus.pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war? this is academic integrity, dc-style. 
and why is central command, as well as the food and drug administration, the us department of transportation, and the us department of health and human services giving money to brookings? 
 former secretary of state madeleine albright, who famously told colin powell , whats the point of having this superb military youre always talking about if we cant use it, predictably says of this current moment , we do think there needs to be more american action. a former bush administration top adviser is also calling for the united states to launch a cruise missile attack on syria. 
the american people are fed up with war, but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation, with russia in syria. 
the demonization of russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a raison dêtre for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of russian world domination. 
its infectious. earlier this year the bbc broadcast a fictional show that contemplated wwiii, beginning with a russian invasion of latvia where 26 percent of the population is ethnic russian and 34 percent of latvians speak russian at home. 
the imaginary wwiii scenario conjures russias targeting london for a nuclear strike. no wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two-thirds of uk citizens approved the new british pms launching a nuclear strike in retaliation. so much for learning the lessons detailed in the chilcot report. 
as this years presidential election comes to a conclusion, the washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept america at war since 911 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place. 
the dc think tanks provide cover for the political establishment, a political safety net, with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention, capitol casuistry. im fed up with the dc policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other peoples lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country. 
any report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tanks sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the reports authors. 
it is our patriotic duty to expose why the dc foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes. 
it is also time for a new peace movement in america, one that includes progressives and libertarians alike, both in and out of congress, to organize on campuses, in cities, and towns across america, to serve as an effective counterbalance to the demuplican war party, its think tanks, and its media cheerleaders. the work begins now, not after the inauguration. we must not accept war as inevitable, and those leaders who would lead us in that direction, whether in congress or the white house, must face visible opposition.",157,736266,fake
"in the first 19 days of october, trump gave just 31k to his own campaign by hrafnkell haraldsson on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 919 am with the election just 10 days away, trump has only donated just 56m of the 100m he promised and won't even invest in his own campaign share on twitter print this post 
you have got to wonder if the trump campaign wishes it had spent less on hats and more on polling now, as it is revealed they had only 16m left in their war chest on october 19 compared to clintons 62m. probably not. there are always others to blame and trumps list of those plotting against him grows in inverse proportion to his polling numbers. 
from june 2015 through september 2016, the trump campaign, meaning donald trump, spent 3.2m on hats according to fec filings . they spent just 1.8m on polling. unsurprisingly, they are behind on polling, leading in precisely zero 0 polls . you want to win an election? you need sweet hats"" -abraham lincoln 
trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling pic.twitter.com4tof5dq1mq 
 jack minor jr. jackminorjr october 26, 2016 
and now clinton has four times the cash. 
and the washington post is reporting that in the first 19 days of october, trump only raised half as much as clinton according to campaign finance reports. his biggest day was the 11.5 million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released, which tells you all you need to know about his base. 
remember when trump claimed he would give 100m of his own money to his campaign? yeah, this is a guy who wont even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia. he uses other peoples money for that. with the election just 10 days away, he has only donated 56m. 
make what you will of this, but he had been giving 2m a month to his campaign. in the first 19 days of october? just 31k in in-kind contributions. thats right even trump wont invest in his own campaign at this point. 
trump pulled in 61m up to october 19, down from 100m in september. meanwhile, the clinton campaign has pulled in a cool 101m in that same period. she spent less than normal, 54m, but that leaves her a war chest of 153m going into the final stretch. 
donald trump says he is a great businessman, yet he has spent twice as much on collateral including hats as he has on paying his staff. he says he gets only the best people. and he bought a lot of his maga hats. his campaign site only sells 18 different styles of hat at 20 to 30 apiece. 
and according to huffington post , the october 15 federal election commission filing for trump make america great again committee shows trump spent 300k of donors money to buy his own book  presumably the art of the deal. he profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments, and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the 22 book at 184 each. 
his campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters, yet trump told a crowd in geneva, ohio that hillary clinton has never earned an honest dollar, well i think thats really, you know 
trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the white house while turning a personal profit. 
now it looks as though trump has seen a point of diminishing returns. he not only did not self-fund his campaign as promised, he has barely spent half of what he said he would spend, down to almost nothing at all as defeat looms and the potential for profit evaporates.

"trump has gotten the republican party sued for trying to intimidate voters the washington post reported  
the democratic national committee has filed papers in federal court against the republican national committee, accusing it of violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation. 
the motion filed in new jersey says the rnc has supported the efforts of presidential candidate donald trumps campaign to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 presidential election. trump has recently been urging his supporters to monitor polling places on election day. 
democrats arent going to stand by and let trump supporters waltz into polling places in heavily democratic areas to intimidate voters. 
trumps call for his supporters to go to polling places that arent their own to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree. 
the republican party, which has completely abandoned the idea of winning elections based on ideas, is firmly standing behind their nominee because the same party that was too weak to stop trump during the primary is certainly not going to stand in the way of what might be their only chance of winning. 
people should not be afraid to go to the polls and vote. no matter who you are voting for, democrats have your back. the republican party has been trying to suppress the vote and intimidate voters for years.

"26 wikileaks bombshells on hillary you need to know 26 wikileaks bombshells on hillary you need to know most explosive revelations that could keep clinton out of white house published 5 mins ago leo hohmann about   archive leo hohmann is a news editor for wnd. he has been a reporter and editor at several suburban newspapers in the atlanta and charlotte, north carolina, areas and also served as managing editor of triangle business journal in raleigh, north carolina. print hillary clinton with top aide huma abedin. 
wikileaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what hillary clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration, but clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations. 
she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks, despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement. 
the emails also shed light on how the clinton campaign interacts with wall street banks, with friendly media, and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of democratic rival bernie sanders with the help of the dnc. 
wikileaks says it has about 50,000 emails from the private gmail account of john podesta, a senior democratic party official who has served as white house chief of staff under president bill clinton and a senior adviser to president obama. he was the author of obamas climate change policy. john podesta 
in february podesta moved seamlessly from the white house to become chairman of hillary clintons 2016 presidential campaign. 
here are some of the most explosive revelations from the wikileaks email dumps featuring podestas account and others. 
preference for muslim americans in 2008, when podesta served as co-chair of president-elect barack obamas transition team, michael froman, a former citibank executive, sent podesta a list of african american, latino and asian american candidates, broken down by cabinetdeputy and underassistantdeputy assistant level, plus a list of native american, arabmuslim american and disabled american candidates. the arab american list came with a special note to exclude arab christians  they had to be both arab and muslim.as new republic reports, obamas eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as froman recommended.froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. 
shielding obama in a march 4, 2015, email to hillary clintons lawyer cheryl mills, clintons eventual campaign chairman podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between clinton and president obama that were sent over clintons private server.the day before podesta sent his email to mills, the house benghazi committee privately told clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.the email from podesta to mills says think we should hold emails to and from potus? thats the heart of his exec privilege. we could get them to ask for that. they may not care, but it seems like they will. an email exchange between podesta, paul begala, and clinton pollster gqrr shows the clinton campaign was pushing the muslim obama narrative back in january 2008. included was a survey of obama negative facts such as this one obama owe-bahm-uhs father was a muslim and obama grew up among muslims in the worlds most populous islamic country. the pollster writes we have reworked the obama message into the survey, as requested. 
secret speeches to wall street hillary clinton was so enraged that bill clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at wall street bank morgan stanley in 2015 that she needed a cool down period. the email chain, on march 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both hillary clinton and former president clinton, and reveals that hillarys future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of bill giving a speech to a wall street bank. morgan stanley is coming down, wrote robby mook in an email to top clinton aides.top aide huma abedin explained that hillary would not be happy about it, writing hrc very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. i will have to tell her that bill chose to cancel it, not that we asked. hillary clintons paid speeches to goldman sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this years primary, were the subject of an email to podesta. excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by clintons research team, including the necessity of having both a public and a private position on issues. it was just part of making sausage in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. some flags in hillary clintons paid speeches were noted in a jan. 25 email from campaign research director tony carrk to top clinton advisers, including clintons declaration that my dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere. countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as fact checkers tried to downplay this email by saying it was mostly about trade, not immigration, as if the words open borders were never mentioned. but the email exchange also shows how hillarys about-face on the tpp trade deal was mere pandering to bernie sanders voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. in a speech at goldman-black rock on feb. 4, 2014, carrk pointed out, clinton admitted shes kind of far removed from middle-class struggles due to the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and i now enjoy. clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to wall street, an issue primary opponent bernie sanders continually raised. clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting donald trump for not releasing his tax returns. 
working in tandem with friendly media wnd reported tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for hillary clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. univision chairman haim saban urged the clinton campaign to hit donald trump harder over immigration. the boston globe tried to time a clinton opinion piece to do the most good in new hampshire. cnbcs john harwood urged clinton campaign chairman podesta to watch out for then-gop candidate dr. ben carson. democratic national committee official and cnn contributor donna brazile apparently tipped off the clinton campaign to a potentially difficult cnn town-hall question on capital punishment during the democratic party primary season. brazile adamantly denies it . in a july 2015 email, new york times reporter mark leibovich appeared to ask permission from hillary clintons communications director, jennifer palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference clinton made to sarah palin and delete clintons statement, and gay rights has moved much faster than womens rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon. cnbc correspondent john harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to donald trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the clinton campaign, emailing podesta with the subject line watch out. the warning was regarding gop presidential candidate ben carson, who could give you real trouble in a general election. maggie haberman, a former politico reporter who now works for the new york times, was described in a january 2015 memo as having a very good relationship with the clinton campaign. we have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed, the memo said. 
demeaning catholics podesta discussed fomenting revolution in the catholic church with a progressive activist while hillarys now-communications director jennifer palmieri mocked catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the democratic party. there needs to be a catholic spring, in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church, sandy newman, president and founder of the nonprofit voices for progress, wrote podesta in february 2012 . the email, among the third batch released by wikileaks, was titled opening for a catholic spring? just musing. podesta tells newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this, the clinton campaign chairman writes. but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now. likewise catholics united. like most spring movements, i think this one will have to be bottom up. clinton, who has accused trump of praising putin, called the russian leader in a 2014 speech engaging and a very interesting conversationalist. excerpts from clintons speeches were contained in a document emailed to podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. 
collusion with doj clinton spokesman brian fallon alerted staffers that the justice department was proposing to publish clintons work-related emails, contending it showed collusion between the obama administration and clintons campaign. fallon wrote that doj folks told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october, podesta met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including peter kadzik, a top official at the justice department. lawyers also told the clinton campaign in emails that hillarys private email scandal  smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing ive either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc . 
entanglements with foreign governments king muhammad iv of morocco made a 12 million pledge to fund the clinton global initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. hillarys top aide, huma abedin, wrote in a january 2015 email that if hrc was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. then she warned she created this mess and she knows it. hillary ended up not attending but her husband bill did. an email from hillary clintons account to podesta on aug. 17, 2014, said saudi arabia and qatar were providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isis and other radical sunni groups in the region. critics have pointed out that the clinton foundation has received considerable funding from the two middle east nations. in a leaked 2013 paid speech to the jewish united fund of metropolitan chicago, hillary said jordan and turkey cant possibly vet all those refugees so they dont know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees. two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of syrian refugees coming to the u.s. largely from united nations refugee camps in jordan. 
insiders insider had sway over dnc a wikileaks email dump on july 22 revealed that debbie wasserman schultz used her position as head of the dnc to work in concert with the clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of sen. bernie sanders, d-vt. schultz was forced to resign over the emails. issues used to undermine sanders campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. the clinton campaign tried to reschedule the illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate republican would get a boost following the super tuesday primaries. the clintons wont forget what their friends have done for them, wrote robby mook, who later became clintons campaign manager, in the november 2014 email to podesta.",238,736264,real
