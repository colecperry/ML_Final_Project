"7 things you need to know about trump attorney general pick jeff sessions  daily wire 7 things you need to know about trump attorney general pick jeff sessions by aaron bandler november 18, 2016 
president-elect donald trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is sen. jeff sessions r-al, who has long been a favorite of conservatives. the democrats already have the long knives out for sessions, spit-balling their usual accusations of racismwhich should indicate that sessions will be an effective attorney general. 
here are seven things you need to know about sessions. 
1. sessions has a 78 percent liberty score on conservative review . sessions has been in the senate for 20 years, and has been described by the washington times as ""a tea partier before the tea party was cool,"" per conservative review 's biography . 
2. sessions has been one of the leaders in the senate in fighting against amnesty. for instance, sessions was among the most prominent members of the senate leading the opposition to the gang of eight bill. national review , which dubbed sessions ""amnesty's worst enemy,"" explained how sessions would reveal ""true facts"" about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadn't decided how to vote on the legislation. sessions and sen. david vitter r-la would find other clever ways to oppose the bill, such as ""an amendment to a resolution honoring the late latino union organizer cesar chavez"" in which vitter noted chavez's opposition to illegal immigration, putting sen. bob menendez d-nj in ""an awkward position."" 
in 2015, sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system, according to conservative review  overturned the zadvydas v. davis supreme court case that obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off dhs and doj law enforcement grants expedited deportation of gang members applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the washington, d.c. mansion murders 
sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration, as he has railed against it as ""the primary source of low-wage immigration into the united states."" 
""what we need now is immigration moderation slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together,"" sessions wrote in a 2015 op-ed in the washington post . 
3. sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues. according to conservative review 's biography of sessions 
in january 2011, he was named ranking member of the senate budget committee. in this capacity, he led the republican charge against majority leader harry reid and barack obama for not offering a serious budget proposal, given that the senate had not passed a budget since april 2009. he has fought guerilla warfare, often a lonely battle, against democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps. he has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the ryan-murray budget deal. sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state. 
sessions has voted against the tarp bailout, stimulus bills, and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state ""with charts warning of the united states' 'crippling' debt,"" per the washington post . 
4. sessions endorsed trump early on. to the surprise of many in the establishment, sessions endorsed trump in february, declaring , ""i believe we are on a movement that must not fade away. this is a campaign, this is a movement. the american people are not happy with their government."" 
it shouldn't have come as a surprise though, given session's record on immigration and that sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade. 
5. sessions is well-liked by his senate colleagues on a personal level. according to the washington post  
""say what you will about him,"" former longtime senate democratic communications aide jim manley told the almanac of american politics. ""he was always nice to the late ted kennedy and other democrats as well."" 
even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. stanley-becker talked to susan parker, a democrat who tried to unseat sessions in 2002. during a debate, she asked for a tissue and sessions handed her one. she joked she would use it to dry her eyes when sessions made her cry, and he responded ""please dont say that. thats my nightmare. i promise ill be nice."" 
it's no wonder then that sessions will likely be confirmed by the senate. 
6. accusations of racism against sessions are absurd. when president ronald reagan nominated sessions, who at the time was a u.s. attorney, to a federal judge, the democrats smeared sessions with accusations of racism, which included calling a black attorney ""boy."" quipping about the ku klux klan ""i used to think they were ok, but they are pot smokers."" joking that a white attorney was ""a traitor to his race"" because he was collaborating with civil rights groups. calling the naacp and aclu ""un-american."" prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud. 
the last point isn't racist at all. the jokes, as ben shapiro has written , were made ""in front of the black lawyer; even the lawyer accusing sessions of racism acknowledged that sessions was joking."" clearly sessions meant them as harmless jokes. sessions has also denied calling the lawyer ""boy."" the civil rights group sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years. 
sessions' record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism, as the weekly standard 's mark hemingway writes 
as a u.s. attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in alabama. and he also prosecuted the head of the state klan, henry francis hays, for abducting and killing michael donald, a black teenager selected at random. sessions insisted on the death penalty for hays. when he was later elected the state attorney general, sessions followed through and made sure the hays executed. the successful prosecution of hays also led to a 7 million civil judgment against the klan, effectively breaking the back of the kkk in alabama. 
7. as attorney general, sessions would uphold the rule of law. the reason why sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law. he has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty. between that and his legal background as a u.s. attorney and alabama attorney general, there is every reason to believe that sessions will follow the law and not politicize the justice department. 
""his interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but i predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor,"" robert driscoll , former deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in national review . ""clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor. creative interpretations of the law may cease, but the meat-and-potatoes work of the division intentional discrimination, police misconduct, disability law will continue apace, conducted without impropriety or political favoritism. that alone will be a breath of fresh air."" tags",43,736287,real

republicans are so far removed from reality that sean hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show, and nobody noticed the difference. 
cnn reported, the progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners. in this case, the fake news originated on a dubious site called your news wire, which publishes a mix of true, slanted and made-up news. then, like a game of telephone, by the time the story got to hannity, even the fake facts were wrong. 
some right-wing websites spread the story, which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop. the fake news eventually reached the gateway pundit, and to sean hannitys radio show. 
after spreading the fake news to millions of listeners, hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right, bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way, i was dealing with more important issues like hrc crimes and lies and how cnn has been colluding with the clinton campaign and cheating bernie sanders. 
hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from donald trump. 
how hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the right-wing media echo chamber works. nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the republican party belief has replaced fact. conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs, so that is what they provide. 
it doesnt matter if the confirmation is true. what matters is that the audience wants it to be true. 
sean hannity is pushing fake news, and he doesnt care. 
this is why there is such a disconnect between republicans and the rest of the country. republican voters are living in a fantasy land that donald trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the republican nomination.

trump and the republicans are jumping to some conclusions. they know that clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs. they are assuming that the fbi is going to find evidence that hillary clinton did something wrong, and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting trump elected.

the email scandal isnt going to help republicans. it hasnt before, and it wont now, but trumps over the top incompetence has killed any boost that republicans might have gotten from the story.",133,736265,real

"obamacare architect says its working as designed! print 
many look at the new healthcare system with their higher premiums and wonder what has happened. why are their coverages shrinking and their premiums growing? some have come to the conclusion that the system itself is to blame. they believe that obamacare is broken? 
what they fail to recognize is that this is not the case at all. what we see as failing to make insurance better has made it worse, but it is simply a problem of ignorance. we just are not smart enough to know the truth. higher premiums and less coverage is the point, it seems. 
breitbart reports  
on wednesdays broadcast of cnn newsroom, mit economics professor and obamacare architect jonathan gruber argued that the law is working as designed. however, it could work better. and i think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty. 
gruber said, obamacares not imploding. the main goal of obamacare was two-fold. one was to cover the uninsured, of which weve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in american history. the other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under obamacare. 
so basically, everything that is being reported is not accurate. there is no reason to think that all of the insurers are bailing like rats on a sinking ship. it just appears that way. this is little more that fools hope so that there will not be a mass exit from the exchange. 
but, unfortunately, people no longer demand proof. they simply take a man like this at his word. so, he will get away with telling chicken little that the sky is not falling; even while it is coming down on his head. 
when you chase emptiness, god will let you catch it.

"trump dedicates d.c. hotel 'the future lies with the dreamers' republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president.
coming off of campaign events in florida tuesday and before he jetted off to north carolina to resume his quest for the white house, trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the trump international hotel washington, d.c., built in the citys historic old post office building.
under budget and ahead of schedule. so important. we dont hear those words so often, but you will, said trump , linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president. today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country.
 
related stories trump sets gop fundraising milestone in small-donor contributions newt gingrich defends donald trump against sexual predator accusations donald trumps star on hollywood walk of fame vandalized trump also spoke as a developer, not just as a candidate.
my job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be, he said. these are spaces that have no hope, no future. but you need imagination and you need the ability to get them done and to unlock their potential, and to unlock the potential of the people working on those spaces and on those projects, and we have so many things we can do for our country.
the united states is great, he said. its great. its people are great. there is no task or project too great. there is no dream outside of our reach. dont ever let anyone tell you it cant be done. the future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.
 
the fact that trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction.

republican strategist steve schmidt , who helped sen. john mccain, r-ariz., in his 2008 white house race, was among those who said trumps priorities were skewed.
the walls are collapsing, schmidt said, referring to polls showing trump behind. trump has discounted those polls as inaccurate and pointed to others that show him leading.

trump campaign manager kellyanne conway suggested that a dose of perspective might be useful.
hes making a pit stop here in washington and his under-budget, ahead-of-schedule hotel is really remarkable. it shows americans the tangible accomplishments of donald trump. hes somebody who builds things. hes somebody who fixes things, she said wednesday on nbcs today show.
and you know, respectfully, hillary clinton has time to go to an adele concert and everybody thinks thats really cool. donald trump stops off to unveil just an incredible, stunning piece of architecture, new hotel, first-class hotel, and everybodys hair is on fire, she said.
conway dared anyone to find a candidate with a more active schedule than trump.
hillary clinton took five days off to prepare for one debate and everybody looked at that as some kind of noble exercise with 23 days to go. nobody covered that as, where is she? why doesnt she campaign much? what is she doing? where is she hiding? conway said. hes got the most active campaign schedule of the two candidates by far.

"getting 10 minutes of sunlight per day can stop depression getting 10 minutes of sunlight per day can stop depression vitamin d is one of the most important vitamins your body needs image credits michael pollakflickr . 
vitamin d is one of the most important vitamins you can give your body. 
this vitamin can affect nearly 2,000 genes in your body, and the best part of it is that you dont even need a supplement to get your full recommended amount of vitamin d  you only need to get out in the sun for a few minutes a day. 
vitamin d is beneficial for staving off depression. without the required amount of vitamin d in your diet or the necessary amount of time spent in the sun, you can experience and excessively low mood and other signs of depression. 
and one of the most well-known and important benefits of vitamin d is the effect it has an calcium absorption and building healthy bones. 
this is especially important for children, as the vitamin helps with bone growth as well as developing strong teeth. those who do not have enough vitamin d may find themselves at risk for fractures or soft bones. 
thus, vitamin d is not only important for children, but also women who can be susceptible to brittle bones as they age. 
the vitamin may also play a crucial role in helping your body ward off disease. studies suggest that getting in enough vitamin d can help ward off multiple sclerosis, heart disease and help your body steer clear of the dreaded flu. 
if you dont get enough vitamin d, you may find yourself feeling tired or experiencing general aches and pains. if the deficiency is severe enough, you may also find yourself developing stress fractures. 
so how do you get enough vitamin d in your diet? 
you can always purchase supplements, most of which contain enough, or in some cases, more than enough of your daily recommended allowance. 
it is also naturally found in salmon, sardines, egg yolk and shrimp. milk, cereal, yogurt and orange juice are often fortified with vitamin d to ensure that you get the recommended amount. 
for those who live in a sunny climate, spending 10 minutes outside per day can actually give you the required amount of vitamin d. although it is not advisable to spend too long outside without protection from the sun in the form of sun block or extra layers of clothing, it is recommended that you do get outside for at least a small part of the day to soak up those rays. 
you can, however, get all of the benefits of vitamin d in your diet or by taking supplements during the winter months when the sun takes a rest, or if you happen to live in a colder climate. newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew. related articles",92,736263,fake

"nato chief downplays concerns over formation of joint european army eu nato secretary general jens stoltenberg speaks during a press conference at the organizations headquarters in brussels on october 26, 2016. photo by afp 
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg has downplayed suggestions that eu military buildup might undermine the western alliance as the bid to establish an independent european army appears to gain momentum. 
""i strongly believe it is absolutely possible to strengthen european defense without duplicating efforts by nato,"" stoltenberg said on thursday, adding, eu leaders have also conveyed that this is not about the eu doing collective defense, the eu building structures that would compete with nato."" 
stoltenberg made the remarks following a meeting between european union's foreign policy chief, federica mogherini, and nato defense ministers in brussels. 
mogherini, one of the strongest supporters of a joint european defense force, has drawn up a global strategy for the bloc, which says the 27-nation bloc should seek ""strategic autonomy"" to face multiple security threats, ranging from conventional to hybrid warfare, from the ukraine crisis to syria, from poverty in africa to massive refugee flows. 
the proposal has sparked concerns that the bloc is seeking a more independent role. 
mogherini on thursday said the bloc does have civilian and military operations, such as in africa or in the mediterranean, and needs to improve command and control centers to run them. 
she, however, attempted to downplay concerns that the formation of an eu force could lead to the duplication of nato functions, saying, ""but this can be done ... without any kind of overlapping or duplication with nato."" nato secretary general jens stoltenberg r chairs a nato defense ministers' meeting, flanked by eu foreign policy chief, federica mogherini 2nd l, and nato deputy secretary general rose gottemoeller 2nd r, at the nato headquarters in brussels on october 27, 2016. photo by afp 
in july, an eu strategy document said that the bloc should look to create greater military autonomy from nato. it stated the eu could no longer rely on the alliance regarding various security issues and must instead develop an ability to act autonomously if and when necessary. 
european commission president jean-claude juncker was the first to call for the establishment of an eu army in march 2015. 
""a joint eu army would show the world that there would never again be a war between eu countries, he said.

"rachel maddow shines the light on trumps white supremacist support by hrafnkell haraldsson   904 am the kkk newspaper features the front page full page story ""make america great again"" with a big featured center photo of donald trump   
rachel maddow traces the history of the post-civil war enforcement acts signed by president ulysses s. grant, including the ku klux klan act , or the enforcement act of 1871 17 stat. 13, which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters. 
to show that the klan act is not vestigial but very much relevant in this election, maddow points to the citation of this law by the democrat party in a whole raft of lawsuits in nevada, arizona, pennsylvania and ohio alleging voter intimidation. 
maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway, the significance of the klan act is that it prohibits conspiracy to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for president or vice president, or as a member of congress of the united states. 
as an example of the role the kkk plays in trumps campaign, maddow produced the kkks newspaper of today, which bills itself as the political voice of white christian america, which, you might note, is identical with fox news demographic. this paper, she says, has been turning up on front lawns in the great state of georgia. 
watch courtesy of msnbc discussion begins at 915 mark 
tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development. this is the newspaper of the ku klux klan today. its the crusader, the political voice of white christian america. the premier voice of white resistance. theyve got  you see the white power symbol there in the upper right-hand corner? theyve got a whole media operation going on apparently. watch white pride tv, listen to kkk radio 24 hours a day. this newsletter is about 12 pages long, features articles on the threat of nonwhite immigration, a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people. theres an article by the founder of the america first party which is all about the terrorist jews. he brags in his byline that hes the man who david duke credits for awakening him to the threat of jewish supremacism. its exactly what you would think from the ku klux klan newspaper. if you knew there was a ku klux klan newspaper these days. but the front page full page story is make america great again with a big featured center photo of donald trump. its one of several articles in the paper about trump, including this in-set article about how trumps candidacy is moving the dialogue forward.  those are a couple of the many, many robocalls that were made during the republican primary campaign on behalf of donald trumps candidacy, calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the american national super pac. the trump campaign doesnt appear to have anything to do with these calls. they reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a trump donor. it was further embarrassing to the trump campaign when this guy, this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls, he was initially picked to be a trump delegate to the republican convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported. 
donald trumps white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a white homeland and that, of necessity, the united states must be this white homeland. as maddow has pointed out in the past, and by their own admission, their eugenics insanity is now out in the open because of donald trump. 
dont believe maddow? demographics pro looked at 10,000 donald trump twitter supporters and found that more than one third follow white nationalist twitter accounts. 
the fact is, trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it, brought it into his own movement, which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white working-class americans, whatever the mainstream media tells you. 
the trump campaign is a maelstrom of hate, and the kkk is right at the heart of it.",133,736269,real

"will it be representative government or thugocracy? will it be representative government or thugocracy? exclusive erik rush envisions clinton using high court 'as a bludgeon' against liberty published 43 mins ago about   archive erik rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare. his latest book is ""negrophilia from slave block to pedestal - america's racial obsession."" in 2007, he was the first to give national attention to the story of sen. barack obama's ties to militant chicago preacher rev. jeremiah wright, initiating a media feeding frenzy. erik has appeared on fox news' ""hannity and colmes,"" cnn, and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances. print 
 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. for me, that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights, on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community, that will stand up and say no to citizens united, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather, her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics, rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. ms. clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country, and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however, was representative of this tactic. 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively, women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the lgbt community accounts for less than 5 percent of the american population, clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values, primarily christians. leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada. a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the u.s. at least not at present; however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil. hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, citizens united, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists. even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark, unaccountable money, the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood, with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros, the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america, someone with whom the clintons also have a long association. 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like. her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely. despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media, there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. 
in recent days, weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected, from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign, the democratic national committee and the white house. 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. what all americans  not just voters, and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. 
the burning question is this in the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?

"the ruthlessly effective rebranding of europes new far right the ruthlessly effective rebranding of europes new far right sasha polakow-suransky, guardian, november 1, 2016 
in april 2002, jean-marie le pen stunned all of europe by defeating the socialist candidate, lionel jospin, in the first round of the french presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. terrified by the prospect of a far-right victory, the french leftincluding communists, greens and the socialist partythrew their support behind the incumbent president, jacques chirac , a pillar of the centre-right establishment who had served as mayor of paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. this electoral strategy effectively isolated le pens front national fn, depicting it as a cancerous force in the french body politic. 
two weeks later, on 5 may, chirac won the election with an astronomical 82 of the vote, trouncing le pen by the biggest margin in a french presidential election since 1848. raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of paris. we have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the countrybut tonight france has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic, chirac declared in his victory speech . then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the place de la r√©publique, he lauded them for rejecting intolerance and demagoguery. 
but may 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of european nations was controlled by large establishment parties. 
jean-marie le pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as chirac. he was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old catholic right. in other words, he was a familiar villainand his ideology represented an archaic france, a defeated past. moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it; his role was to be a rabble-rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate. 
europes new far right is different. from denmark to the netherlands to germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade-and-a-half, and they are casting a much wider net than jean-marie le pen ever attempted to. and by deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites, they are rapidly broadening their base. 
le pens own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right unlike her incendiary father, marine le pen is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win upwards of 40 of the vote in regions from calais in the north to the c√¥te dazur in the south. she and her danish and dutch counterparts are notas some on the left would like to believeneo-nazis or inconsequential extremists with fringe ideas lacking popular appeal. 
these parties have built a coherent ideology and steadily chipped away at the establishment parties hold on power by pursuing a new and devastatingly effective electoral strategy. they have made a very public break with the symbols of the old rights past, distancing themselves from skinheads, neo-nazis and homophobes. they have also deftly co-opted the causes, policies and rhetoric of their opponents. they have sought to outflank the left when it comes to defending a strong welfare state and protecting social benefits that they claim are threatened by an influx of freeloading migrants. 
they have effectively claimed the progressive causes of the leftfrom gay rights to womens equality and protecting jews from antisemitismas their own, by depicting muslim immigrants as the primary threat to all three groups. as fear of islam has spread, with their encouragement, they have presented themselves as the only true defenders of western identity and western libertiesthe last bulwark protecting a besieged judeo-christian civilisation from the barbarians at the gates. 
these parties have steadily filled an electoral vacuum left open by social democratic and centre-right parties, who ignored voters growing anger over immigrationsome of it legitimate, some of it bigotedor simply waited too long to address it. 
they have shed some of the rights most unsavoury baggage while responding to both economic anxiety and fear of terrorism by blending a nativist economic policymore welfare, but only for us and tough anti-immigration and border security measures. their message is beginning to resonate widely with a fearful population that believes the liberal governing elite no longer listens to them. 
brexit was just the start. europes new far right is poised to transform the continents political landscapeeither by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. and when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far-right party 10 years agothe young, gay people, jews, feministsmay join the working-class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right. 
on 6 may 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of paris to celebrate chiracs historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the dutch far right, pim fortuyn, was gunned down by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. his assassin later claimed that he had killed fortuyn to stop him from using muslims as scapegoats. in national elections nine days later, fortuyns eponymous partythe pim fortuyn list became the second largest in the netherlands with 17 of the vote. 
fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. his time in the limelight was short but transformative. 
it was fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far-right leaders across europe. he may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of plain-spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of islamic culture as a backwards and reactionary threat to the hard-won progressive values of western europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. his ideological inheritors in dutch politics, as well as the revamped front national in france, the danish peoples party and germanys alternative f√ºr deutschland have all emulated fortuyn in their own ways. 
fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the european far right was not a us-style appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was defending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration, argues merijn oudenampsen of tilburg university. the netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike france, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to womens liberation and gay rights. 
before founding his own party in 2002, fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre-right party, the peoples party for freedom and democracy vvd, in the late 1990s. the partys then-leader, frits bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. he had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour, said bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of amsterdam. i didnt want him to be in my parliamentary group, so i cold-shouldered him . . . he would have acted as a fragmentation bomb. 
fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of far-right politics in progressive garba form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance, as a new yorker profile once described ithe redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death. 
two years after fortuyn was killed, the netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. early one morning in november 2004, the filmmaker theo van gogh was murdered by a young dutch-moroccan, mohammed bouyeri, who shot van gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. the letter was a death threat aimed at the somali-born dutch parliamentarian ayaan hirsi ali a vocal critic of islam who was soon placed under the protection of the dutch security services. 
the two assassinations shook the netherlands to its core and catapulted a little-known and theatrically coiffed politician, geert wilders , to popularity as an ideological successor to fortuyn. wilders had also flirted with bolkesteins vvd, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. in late 2004, he split off and formed his own. with hirsi ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent anti-immigration voice in the countryand has remained so ever since. 
for those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. six months before chiracs trouncing of le pen and fortuyns assassination, denmark had an election. on its surface the result was not a historical watershed; the centre-right venstre party ousted the social democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. what had changed was that the danish peoples party, which had campaigned on an overtly anti-immigrant platform, took 12 of the votetransforming it into a kingmaker in parliament. 
unlike france, which revelled in its triumph over the fn, or the netherlands, where the remains of fortuyns party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the dpp immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. and it was not only taking votes from the right; it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them. 
the dpp had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the social democratspromising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. as the outgoing social democratic prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat they took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say. back then, naser khader, a danish member of parliament who immigrated from syria as a child, argued that the best way to weaken the dpp is to give them influence. he was wrong. 
the headquarters of the front national sits on a quiet street in the unassuming paris suburb of nanterre, near a car repair shop and a portuguese restaurant. only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. in her modest second-floor office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, marine le pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the holocaust a  detail of history  into a genuine contender for the presidency. 
voluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries, le pen said of her father. but she insisted that she has now cleaned house. i fired them all . . . all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that i found unacceptable. 
julien rochedy, a 28-year-old who headed the fns youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. whereas the partys former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made jews hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, you will be attacked straight away, rochedy said. there is such self-discipline these days. they are so afraid theyll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist. 
still, the partys detractors continue to level the same charges at the fn, which outrages marine le pen . today our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop old tropes about fascists and racists. at a certain point this argument loses its force, she continued, because voters see clearly that theres absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism. 
le pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. she has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and leftand other constituencieswho could never have imagined voting for her fathers front national. 
as le mondes olivier faye has written , she is trying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the fnthat of homophobia. and it is working a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32up from just 19 in a similar poll from 2012. 
as le pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to jewish voters more explicit for a lot of french jews, the fn appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the banlieues , le pen told me. in a very natural way they have turned toward the fn, because the fn is capable, i think, of protecting them from that. 
among french voters threatened by the countrys new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. and peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far-right parties across europe . in france, marine le pen has promised a return to a time when the french had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when french schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation. 
a growing number of french people feel uncomfortable in their own country, the prominent philosopher, alain finkielkraut , declared in january during a debate with the centre-right presidential candidate alain jupp√©who has taken a less strident line on islam and migration than his rival nicolas sarkozy. finkielkraut depicted contemporary france as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that the public good isnt in the clouds, its made from tangible thingsthe french of proust and montaigne . . . the jardin du luxembourg and the cows of normandy. 
finkielkraut, a 67-year-old jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the front national, but marine le pens deliberate appeals to jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade agothat the left, with its indulgence of islam, poses a greater threat to france than the far right. after chirac saved the republic from jean-marie le pen in 2002, finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger the future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for vichy, he wrote,  . . . in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nationin the camp of respect, not that of rejection. 
fourteen years later, after the terrorist attacks on charlie hebdo, the bataclan and nice, finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. anti-racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us, he told me when we met in his paris apartment this summer. while he is still no fan of the fn, he believes it has changed and argues that it should be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of anti-fascism. the french must, he insisted, avoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. we must not mistake what era we live in. europe doesnt only have demons; it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies. 
he worries that integration has been such a failure that france will have to reconquer its lost territoriesby which he means the suburbs surrounding paris. integrating people is not telling them you are how you are and we are how we are . . . integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation. and if that doesnt happen, he warned darkly, at best well have secession and at worst civil war. continued immigration from muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the planned demise of europe. 
across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter france has become a potent political force. in the southern city of b√©ziers, mayor robert m√©nard, a former trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group reporters without borders , is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the french officers who joined a failed coup against de gaulle in 1961 to prevent algerian independence . m√©nard comes from a family of pieds-noirs , french settlers in algeria. he regards the evian accords that ended the algerian war as a capitulation, and those who tried to preserve french algeria as heroes. 
this nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal, but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect. whereas young britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the eu and the elderly voted to leave, in france it is the opposite. according to julian rochedy, the former fn youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in francewho dream of an era they never witnessedthan with the old, who lived through the era marine le pen promises to restore. it is older voters, rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to le pens victory. they are afraid of leaving the euro, he says. they are afraid of huge changes. rochedy is convinced that the fn will never win simply by fetishising the past. they just want to go back 30 years, he said of his erstwhile colleagues. its a discourse that doesnt at all take into account the world as it is and what france has become. 
even if le pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the rightthe former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western europe. 
as the french communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. according to andrew hussey, a liverpool-born academic who teaches in paris, the technocratic leaders of the socialist party many of them graduates of the ultra-elite ecole nationale dadministrationare so disconnected from ordinary people that even former marxists wont consider voting for them. distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the fn. i think youve got a big political question here about who looks after you, hussey said. this is a very communist way of thinking. 
le pen knows that she is attracting these people. many of her supporters used to be socialists, but they arent any more, she told me. although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare statethats a socialist concept, she insistedle pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich. 
i defend fraternitythe idea that a developed country should be able to be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. the french state no longer does that, she told me. were in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks. and she has seen results. she points to the northern pas-de-calais region. it was socialist-communist for 80 years, she says. i won 45. 
at the same time as marine le pen was working to de-demonise the fn, the leaders of the dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out-of-touch political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear extremist islam. 
geert wilders and his party for freedom pvv have surpassed the dutch labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the march 2017 election. last september, wilders declared that europe was facing an  islamic invasion the sort of comments that landed him in court this week on charges of inciting racial hatred , which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression. 
the presence of masses of young men in their 20s with beards singing allahu akbar across europe, wilders warned at the peak of last years refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to our prosperity, our security, our culture and identity. across the country, grassroots groups responded to wilderss warning, attempting to block the resettlement of asylum seekers in their towns. last october, klaas dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny north-eastern village of oranje, where the dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked dijkhoffs car and tore off its rearview mirrors. a few days later, near utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks. 
in the decade following the assassinations of fortuyn and van gogh, the integration of muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in dutch politics. suddenly, turkish and moroccan-born dutch citizens became muslims. and as the public debate over islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observancewearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during ramadanbecame politically loaded. 
the dutch labour mp ahmed marcouch, who came to the netherlands from rural morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. it is a jolt to the traditionally liberal netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they cant shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. as marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that dutch youth culture promotes. 
wilderss pvv has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugeesone of his latest memes is simply de-islamiseto win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away. 
by framing its anti-migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the pvv has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to euroscepticism. meanwhile, many causes of the radical leftincluding anti-racism and anti-colonialismhave now become establishment thinking in the netherlands. idealism has been bureaucratised, argues the journalist bas heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper nrc handelsblad. and when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it. thats why there is such a strong anti-pc tone to the dutch right do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to. 
just as marine le pens fn has become a huge presence on social media in france, the right is in the midst of colonising the dutch media. geen stijl no style, a popular breitbart-style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. it is massively important, says tilburg universitys merijn oudenampsen, like a social movement. the site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after fortuyns murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in dutch public debate, with an army of reactors on twitter. according to oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that geen stijl is the first site they check in the morning. 
the rights newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist kustaw bessems, from the leftwing volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. in the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left badmouth immigrants and you were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up. now, its the other way around. as soon as you say anything other than immigration is a problem or islam is the cause of terrorism . . . the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you. 
a dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of muslim immigrants and the threat of radical islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of islamism or terrorism. while politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, the economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culturebut none of them have any idea about theology. even scholars of radicalisation tend to study todays extremists through the historical lens of the european radical leftwhich does little to explain what leads a small number of young muslim men such as van goghs killer, mohamed bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. its easy to be a marxist, the security official quipped. its fucking hard to be a salafi. 
as the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far rights tirades about islamisation. these days it is not only anti-migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. there are also many disappointed progressivesthe people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of dutch society. suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. there is a sense that, we are welcoming and then they do this, says bas heijne. they have been terribly let down in their good intentions. and in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and jews feel threatenedand some have become reflexively suspicious of muslims. 
the stereotype that observant muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. when the moroccan-born labour mp ahmed marcouch first joined in amsterdams legendary gay pride parade , he was, as he puts it, the first hetero-active muslim to participate. the gay community feared violence from extremists; conservative muslims were baffled and angry. both groups concluded, oh, maybe marcouch is homosexual too, he says with a laugh. neither group could imagine a straight muslim doing what he did. 
but public displays of solidarity such as marcouchs are rare. among openly gay couples and religious jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young muslim men. much as in france, this fraught atmosphere has made far-right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them. 
in amsterdam earlier this year, i had several meetings with a staunch jewish supporter of wilderss pvv, who insisted on remaining anonymous. he described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed alain finkielkraut. its an outdated reflex for jews to always say the problem is the extreme right, he told me. we have new enemies and we need new ideas. 
the experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that europes capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. anne frank wasnt betrayed by the germans, he argued. but by dutch people. regular dutch. jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. the trains for the jews will always come, he added, ominously. id rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains. 
he is not unsympathetic to the plight of european muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. if i were a muslim in europe at this moment id be very uneasy, he admitted. if europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. its the history of europe to treat foreigners terribly. we jews know that. 
for that reason, he argues, muslims should regard wilders as a lesser evil. every muslim should be happy geert wilders exists. if someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse, he told me menacingly. wilders is civil. he is a democrat. he is not the new hitler. 
to frits bolkestein, who led the netherlands centre-right vvd in the 1990sand was briefly wilders boss when he was a young aide in the party officethe rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about islam. the dutch labour party, he argues, gave up on its working-class base they made a major mistake, he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. faced with the choice between the foreign-born and the labour classes, they chose the foreign-born  and theyve paid for it dearly. current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds out of 150 to just 10. 
marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in france, many former labour voters now back wilders. moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white dutch families were moving out. their message to the labour party, he said, is you ignored us. you let it happen. 
the danish peoples party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged anti-immigrant sentiment to siphon away the social democrats traditional basepeople who fear that the bread will be buttered more thinly, as the danish journalist lars trier mogensen puts it. 
the dpp has effectively combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro-welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. s√∏ren espersen, the dpps deputy leader, doesnt think that former social democrats will ever go back. when one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking, he says of voters who supported the social democrats all their lives. and why should he go back? i mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then hes done it. 
the social democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the dpp. one of those places is the small satellite town of herlev, about 10 miles west of copenhagen. the 41-year-old social democratic mayor, thomas gyldal petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his partys political misfortunes. 
for gyldal petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. as soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrantor majority unemployedhe says, problems start to arise. he blames his own partys leaders mayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change. but the party leadership shut their eyes, he says. 
then came the muhammad cartoons . in 2005, the editors at jyllands-posten, denmarks largest newspaper, invited a group of well-known cartoonists to draw the prophet. the initial response was underwhelming, but within a few monthsthrough a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imamsthe cartoons became a full-blown crisis, with boycotts of danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the middle east. danes who had never contemplated voting for the dpp now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their best-known journalists. suddenly, the dpps platform was making sense. they had warned that muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. politicians such as naser khader, who once warned that giving the dpp influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum. when khader founded a new organisation called democratic muslims in the wake of the cartoon controversy, he received death threats. 
those at the top of the social democrats are now taking a tough stance, too. earlier this year the party leader, mette frederiksen, went to stockholm to meet with fellow scandinavian social democrats. there she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. we social democrats must accept that there is a clash, she declared. it is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help . . . but just as strong is our value that we must have a well-functioning welfare state. frederiksen continued my position is that a universally funded scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy. 
but in its zeal to get tough on migration, denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivismthe sort of place that bernie sanders liked to mention at campaign rallies. in january, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, denmark passed what became known as the  jewellery law , which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner 1,200 would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating asylum-seekers. editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. according to kenneth kristensen berth, a babyfaced mp for the dpp, it was about deterrence. the goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in denmark, he said. the jewellery provision was a minor part. more important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years, he added. and it wasnt just the dpp and government who supported itthe social democrats voted for it, too. 
bent melchior, denmarks 87-year-old former chief rabbi, was outraged. he bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. he would know although denmark is always hailed for saving its jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that danish jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to sweden. melchiors family paid the equivalent of almost a years rent of a six-room flat just for his own passage. denmark is not a poor country, for gods sake, melchior says. theres food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody. 
the road that led a centre-left party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. the scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. as the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. there has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. but the larger issue, as the oxford economist paul collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor. 
herlevs mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. we have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to denmark in a number that we can help. if the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together, petersen warns. 
but such balance may only help so much. aydin soei, a danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the danish governmentone that native danes who have never been on the receiving end of the states integration policy have failed to see. a lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of the state recognising their education and their skills, soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. if your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago, he argues. 
instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored themassuming that its work was done. the problem, soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. it doesnt have consequences for the politicians . . . because they dont have the right to vote. either way, it plays into the dpps argument. immigrants cant do right, said gyldal petersen. when theyre unemployed theyre a burden to society. when theyre in a job, they just stole the job from a dane. 
whether or not marine le pen wins next years french election or wilders pvv becomes the largest party in the netherlands, the new far right is not going away. the reflex among many establishment partiesand media institutionshas been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back. 
rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. when i spoke again recently with the jewish wilders supporter from amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been wonregardless of the outcome of next years elections. the pvv has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. the labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing wilders said five years ago, he told me. you can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate. 
if traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the meritsand flawsof their policies and counter their messages of fear. 
not least among the lessons of brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just one more thing nobody asked them about . this is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. and the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. they know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as jean-marie le pen was, as antisemites or racists. 
in france, the new majority marine le pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the brexit campaign victory. in a park near calais castle-like town hall in may, samuel and pascal, activists from a group named retake calais, railed against the towns centre-right mayor. they blamed her for the growth of the sprawling, trash-strewn tent city known as the jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until it was dismantled this month . those who govern us are completely against us. the illegals, who arent french, can do whatever they want, they told me. for them, even marine le pen is too soft. 
if resettlement programmes take refugees away from calais to other parts of france, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. theyre sending them to all the little villages in france, says samuel. after they start to open businesses and bring family members, in two years the village will be dead. 
about a mile down the road, the calais ferry terminal lies behind layers of tall steel fences and coiled barbed wire. i met rudy vercucque and yohann faviere, the local fn leaders, on a blustery morning in june outside the terminal, where they were anxiously awaiting a visiting eu dignitary. giant seagulls circled and squawked above as they denounced the mayor, natacha bouchart, a member of sarkozys republicans party. 
its she who has permitted this, vercucque, a portly 35-year-old, fumed. and it was sarkozy, he reminded me, who negotiated the notorious le touquet accords , effectively moving the british border to where we were standing. calais depends on british tourism and revenues are down sharply. the result is crippling economic and social malaise find a doctor who wants to move to calais. find a surgeon who wants to move to calais, vercucque exclaimed. you work your whole life, you pay off your house and you lose money. its intolerable. their support locally may have once been a protest vote, said faviere, but no longer. today we really have people who adhere to our ideas. 
vercucque was more blunt we say out loud what people think deep down.",13,736271,fake

imran gashkori  sports editor  
as excitement for summer cricket builds, wynnum father chris richards has honed his preparation, taking 7 wickets in a frightening spell yesterday. 
they were coming out perfectly, the 36-year-old said between celebratory beers. the australian tradition of backyard cricket has gotten much more competitive in recent years. photo supplied. 
warnie always said one brings two in this case i went further, he said. 
the full-time landscaper took the wickets of his three kids aged 5, 8  13 as well as his wife 32 and two kids from down the street ages unknown. 
i was a pretty talented junior but my best was only three or four for, he said. 
richards claimed the scalps in just four overs on his 16-meter backyard pitch aided by generous electric wickie rules and the controversial one-hand-one-bounce law. richards vehemently denies that he tampered with the ball, despite half of it being covered in a mysterious tape for the duration of the match. photo supplied. 
however, video has emerged of richards allegedly tampering with the ball with what seems like red electrical tape. 
the tape was already on the ball before we started playing. thats well within the rules, he said. 
neighbours described his spell as frightening and intense but added numerous dismissals were through the six-and-out by-law. 
in addition to his economical and wicket-to-wicket line-and-length bowling style, richards also used an impressive array of sledges and other psychological tactics to get under the skin of the opposition team. 
his daughter kayla explains. 
dad would dip one in short and id have to dive out-of-the-way, she said. 
every time i tried to dodge the short balls, hed call me a poofter, which doesnt make any sense to me, 
despite the criticism levelled against him, richards has lashed out at his detractors. 
you dont hear johno mitchell johnson whinge about how he takes em the one-time 3rd grader said. 
im already growing the mo so i can steam in with him when the ashes start. 
i played it smart. me boy jacob aged 8  is a pretty timid kid. i knew after knocking over darcy aged 5 with a full toss that he would be pretty nervous at the crease. i banged the first one in short to get him backing away. he was a frightened rabbit after that. all i had to do was put the next one on the stumps. seven balls later i had his wicket.

"megyn kelly makes bombshell admission about trump and the media on november 13, 2016 1243 pm  
before the leaked tape of donald trump describing his propensity to grab women by the pussy to billy bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring donald trumps glaring faults as a presidential candidate. during the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. it turns out there might be a reason for that  trump was bribing the media  at least thats the accusation being made by megyn kelly of fox news. 
in her memoire settle for more, which will be released this week, kelly said that trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. that question set trump off on one of his twitter tirades. these are only a portion 
the worst and most controversial of which was this 
as the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. if they didnt, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. 
while kelly couldnt speak for other members of the media, she alleges that trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. while the attempt clearly didnt work on kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. 
this is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign i was not the only journalist to whom trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage, kelly said. he also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, this is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking. 
trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded, she said. 
when it became obvious that some reporters were in the tank for trump, she alleges in one chapter, certain tv hosts would work with the candidate in advance on occasional trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. she didnt identify them by name or media outlet. 
source yahoo 
kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which kelly asked about trumps treatment of women, the candidate called fox news exec. bill sammon, who told him about the first question. all we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was hillary clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. the insider knowledge said that a woman, in the flint, michigan debate, would ask a question about the flint water . 
while bribing journalists isnt illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. without the fourth estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.

"currency crisis alasdair macleod on the vexed question of the dollar tweet home  gold  gold news  currency crisis alasdair macleod on the vexed question of the dollar there is little doubt that the rapid expansion of both dollar-denominated debt and monetary quantities since the financial crisis will lead us into a currency crisis. we just dont know when, and the dollar is not alone 

from alasdair macleod  all the major paper currencies have been massively inflated in recent years. with the dollar acting as the worlds reserve currency, where the dollar goes, so do all the other fiat monies . until that cataclysmic event, we watch currencies behave in increasingly unexpected, seemingly irrational ways. the fundamentals for japan are not good, yet the yen remains the strongest currency of the big four. the eurozone risks a systemic collapse, overwhelmed by political and financial headwinds, yet the euros exchange rate has proved relatively impervious to this deep uncertainty. the british economy is strongest, yet sterling is the weakest of the four majors. if nothing else, todays foreign exchanges are evidence that subjectivity triumphs over macroeconomic thinking. mackays extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds beats computer modelling every time. furthermore, any official attempt to establish a rate for the dollar has to address two separate questions the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, and its purchasing power for goods and services. the chart below indicates how the dollar has behaved against other currencies over the last five years, both on a trade weighted and on a predefined currency basis dxy. it should be noted that the dollar has risen on both these measures by roughly 18 since early 2014. at the same time, the chinese yuan has fallen against the dollar by about 12, so it has actually risen slightly against the dxy basket as a whole, particularly against the euro component, where it has gained 12 since early 2014. this matters, because far from devaluing, which is what we are routinely told by dollar-centric analysts, the yuan has been relatively stable over time against a basket of currencies. it has been weak against the dollar and yen, but strong against both the euro and sterling. we should look at this from the feds federal open market committees point of view. america runs a record trade deficit with china, and the only major economies where chinas terms of trade have improved are with the us, excepting japan . therefore, the fed is bound to be very sensitive to the dollars exchange rate with chinas yuan furthermore, on two occasions when the fed had signalled it was going to raise the fed funds rate, it backed off when the chinese lowered the rate at which it had pegged the yuan to the dollar. chinese devaluation against the dollar is obviously a prime concern for the fed. the situation becomes better understood when the peoples banks position is taken into account. the bank has been selling us treasury stock in large quantities, stockpiling commodities and oil with the proceeds, though it has been diversifying into japanese government bonds as well. chinas dollars have been welcomed by markets, which are short of both quality collateral and raw currency. however, chinas supply of both has failed to stop the dollar rising against the yuan. furthermore, china isnt the only asian and middle eastern state selling american paper, so the demand from other international players on the buy side has been immense, enough to determine the underlying direction of the dollars exchange rate. the situation is being exploited by the peoples bank. in effect, the peoples bank is in a position to dictate fed policy by adjusting the rate at which it is prepared to supply dollars into the market. so long as the dollar remains fundamentally strong, it only has to slow the pace of treasury and dollar sales for the dollar to rise, and therefore the feds planned interest rate rises to be deferred. this is not understood properly by western commentators, who erroneously think china is being forced to defend a declining yuan. nothing could be further from the truth. it will be interesting to see whether this happens again ahead of the december fomc meeting, when for the umpteenth time we have been promised a rise in the fed funds rate. a major consideration behind chinas foreign exchange policy is the outlook for the euro. the eurozone represents a market as large as the us, with the added importance of being tagged onto the asian continent. there can be little doubt that china sees her own long-term future being aligned more with europe than america, despite europes current troubles. it is, if you like, a situation that is primarily of strategic importance. europes economy will need rescuing at some stage, and is therefore a future opportunity for chinas intervention. that plan is for the long term, and becomes increasingly valid the deeper the hole the eurozone digs for itself. a disintegration of the eu would also be beneficial for chinese ambitions. meanwhile, in the short-term the euro has broken a crucial trend-line against the dollar, having completed a continuation head-and-shoulders pattern, targeting the 1.0600 area, which is the previous low seen in march and november 2015. this is our second chart. neither the peoples bank nor the fed need to be chart experts to see whats happening. brexit was very bad news for the euro, because it is a racing certainty that the event will turn out to be just the start of a new round of political and economic trouble for the eurozone. the italian economy in particular is imploding, with a non-performing loan problem that is roughly 40 of private sector gdp. so china can for the moment steer a course for the yuan between the euros devaluation and the dollars rise. the fed sees in euro weakness an increase of currency-induced deflation for the us economy, and a loss of competitiveness for us exports. chinese exporters are obvious beneficiaries as well, so the blame for deflation will be on chinas foreign exchange machinations. anyway, china probably cares less than she ever did about the long-term consequences of her actions on the us economy. china has been selling her us treasuries and reducing her dollar exposure to add to her stockpiles of raw materials and oil. she wants to keep her over-indebted businesses trading by maintaining a favourable exchange rate with the dollar, particularly given the developing train wreck thats the eurozone. and theres not a lot the fed can do about it. gold and commodities the principal driver for the gold price is the prospect of monetary inflation transmuting into price inflation, and the inability of central banks to respond to this threat by raising interest rates sufficiently to control the balance of consumer preferences between goods and holding money. we are, of course, measuring gold in dollars, because the latter is the reserve currency for all the others. but, as stated above, there are two exchange considerations, the first being the dollar against other currencies, and the second the dollar against a basket of commodities. and here, we should note that over the long-term, the prices of commodities measured in gold are considerably more stable than the prices of commodities measured in fiat currencies. china has behaved as if she is thoroughly aware of golds pricing attributes, and has a deliberate policy of dominating the market for bullion. this is very different from the uss domination of gold paper markets. not only has china invested in unprofitable gold mines to become the largest producer at about 450 tonnes annually, but the state monopolises chinas refining capacity. she also imports dor√© for refining from other countries, and without doubt since 1983 has accumulated substantial quantities of bullion not included in monetary reserves. furthermore, it is the only country that has encouraged its population, through television and other media, to accumulate physical gold. make no mistake, for the last thirty-three years, the chinese government has made a credible attempt to gain ultimate control over the physical gold market, and to extend golds protection to her own citizens. china does not manipulate the gold price. instead, as described earlier, she is manipulating the dollar by regulating the exchange rate and by discouraging the fed from raising interest rates. it is a temporary balancing act that only continues so long as desperate banks and their indebted borrowers continue to scramble for dollars, and china knows it. the fed, for the moment, appears to be powerless to manage economic outcomes and is firmly trapped by chinas currency management, with interest rates stuck at the lower bound. and to make it worse, the weak euro, against which the dollar index dxy is very heavily weighted 57!, threatens to force the dxy index even higher. the result, inevitably, is that monetary policy cannot be used to address future price inflation, which virtually guarantees there will be a higher gold price in 2017 and beyond. this is why, despite american wishful thinking, gold remains at the centre of the financial system. it is central partly because chinas ensures it is, and it is also chinas ultimate money for commodity and trade purposes. china most likely has enough gold to fully compensate for her reserve losses from the destruction of the dollar and the other fiat currencies on her reserve book. she is deliberately selling down her dollar exposure anyway, while she can. lest we forget, communist economists in china were taught that capitalism destroys itself. for them, there is no clearer proof than the performance of the us economy and the dollar, and they do not intend to get caught up in its demise. understand this, and you understand all. while the monetary role of gold in the future has yet to be determined by china, and it will be china or the markets that make the decision, for the moment it can be regarded as the ultimate insurance against global currency failure.",164,736269,fake

"jill stein issues last warning do not vote for hillary or its mushroom clouds everywhere √¢≈ìget ready for war with russia√¢ if hillary clinton is elected president, said progressive green party presidential nominee jill stein.
√¢≈ìthis election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,√¢ stein warned, explaining that clinton√¢s trigger-happy militarism √¢≈ìis a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.√¢
while stein adamantly opposes a trump presidency, she explained that the dangers posed by a clinton presidency are √¢≈ìarguably even more immediate and intense.√¢
stein blasted clinton√¢s √¢≈ìwarmongering√¢ that √¢≈ìalmost singlehandedly√¢ brought us the turmoil in libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if clinton were elected president.
√¢≈ìhillary brought us libya almost singlehandedly,√¢ stein explained in a thursday fox business interview. she continued
and she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. like it or not, russia has the sanction of international law to be there. for us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with russia. both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. this is the most dangerous moment√¢ according to the former president of the soviet union, mikhail gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever.
stein elaborated on this view during a facebook live interview with progressive marc lamont hill, who has endorsed stein over clinton √¢≈ìin this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,√¢ stein said, adding
not only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where hillary has this proven track record √¢≈õ of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and she√¢s calling for a no-fly zone in syria, which means we√¢re essentially declaring war on russia if hillary gets elected√¢declaring war on russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the russians on hair trigger alert. this is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. so it√¢s really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.
√¢≈ìno one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having hillary in white house. in some ways, they√¢re arguably even more immediate and intense,√¢ stein said. √¢≈ìbut the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and, really, across the world√¢this movement that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.√¢
√¢≈ìit√¢s very clear what kind of a trend we√¢re on,√¢ stein explained
this is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. where is the exit strategy if you buy into this idea that one must vote for one of the major parties? it means that in every election, we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving wall street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy. √¢≈õ there is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. it means with each race, we come closer and closer to the cliff.
√¢≈ìwe must find and elect alternatives to the wall street-backed oligarchy, the warmongers, and the anti-humanitarians,√¢ stein wrote on twitter.
stein, who has previously described clinton as √¢≈ìqueen of corruption,√¢ attacked clinton for her questionable ties to qatar and saudi arabia
during her interview with stein, fox business host kennedy blasted other members of the mainstream media for ignoring and trying to √¢≈ìsmother√¢ stein√¢s √¢≈ìauthentic√¢ and √¢≈ìinteresting√¢ candidacy.
√¢≈ìi√¢m surprised that the mainstream media has taken an interesting, authentic candidate like yourself√¢ they were so obsessed with bernie sanders√¢ and you√¢ve got someone, the embodiment of this new and interesting political tapestry, and they√¢ve essentially ignored you and smothered your candidacy,√¢ kennedy said.
stein agreed and said that the corporate media√¢s blackout of her campaign and their perpetuation √¢≈ìspeaks volumes.√¢ she said, √¢≈ìmy campaign is a very inconvenient truth that there is a politics of integrity out there. √¢≈õ every day, there are more revelations how both √¢≈õ trump and clinton are walking, talking scandal machines, and people are clamoring for something else.√¢ she added, √¢≈ìthe corporate media, the apologists for the democrats and republicans, and the political pundits are doing everything they can to intimidate people into voting for the system that√¢s throwing them under the bus.√¢

"guardian plays robin to mi5s batman     information guardian plays robin to mi5s batman by jonathan cook
 today the guardian offers decisive confirmation that it is only too willing to serve as an establishment mouthpiece. it proudly announces that it is the venue selected by andrew parker, the head of mi5, britains fbi, to receive the agencys first-ever newspaper interview.
if the guardian were a proper independent newspaper, it would regard this interview as a stain. instead it bills it as a front-page exclusive. exclusively, the guardian has been given the chance to regurgitate mi5s propaganda  propaganda designed to help stoke a new cold war with russia.
in fact, this is not an interview as the guardian claims, for the simple reason that the papers two interviewers  one of them its deputy editor, paul johnson  have no basis on which to question the quality of the classified information they are being fed.
everything parker tells them could have been guessed at without the interview
the russians under vladimir putin are an evil empire; islamic jihadists are everywhere but mi5 is brilliant at foiling their terror attacks; the increased budget mi5 has received is entirely justified because it is doing such a brilliant job of foiling terror attacks; mi5s extra powers to surveil us all are necessary to foil those terror attacks; whatever happens with brexit, mi5 will continue doing a brilliant job protecting the british people; mi5 is determined to become a friendlier place for women and minority ethnic applicants. this isnt journalism, its the very definition of stenography.
even the guardian seems to sense that its readers might wonder why this interview is being published in their newspaper. but rather than discuss why the guardian would want to publish an interview with parker, the paper asks the opposite question why has mi5 chosen the guardian? this is framed in a way to make it look as though parker has entered a combative environment in coming to the guardian. the paper reminds us that it broke the edward snowden story.
in fact, the guardians snowden revelations seem like another era. remember that the guardian got access to snowdens documents only via their star columnist glenn greenwald, who has since departed after what appeared to be an increasingly troubled relationship, especially after the snowden revelations. instead parker is once again given an opportunity to attack snowden, accentuating the damage that was done to the work of british and allied intelligence agencies by snowdens efforts to bring to public attention the systematic and secretive invasions of our privacy.
the guardian is in far more comfortable territory playing robin to mi5s batman.
so why has parker selected the guardian rather than, say, the more obviously establishment london times?
because the guardians articles are not behind a paywall and so are easily accessible to anyone online? because it has become the preferred british news source for american elites, whose own media are even more servile to power? because the guardians unjustified reputation for leftwing and critical journalism will bestow on this mi5 press release the necessary pretence that parker has been subjected to tough questioning from the guardian? or because parker knew that the guardian would be as docilely accepting of his propaganda as any rightwing outlet of the corporate media?

"sorry liberalsyou can stop with the petitionshillary did not win the popular vote go to article dear abby, i supported a woman i knew had a history of criminal activity, who is married to a rapist and who left 4 men to die in benghazi. she put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. she is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, i supported her anyhow, because shes a democrat and has a vagina. someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if i just signed a petition. they said that trump really didnt win, because hillary won the popular vote. is that true? 
okay, lets address this hillary might win the popular vote, isnt that electoral college situation just awful thing head on. 
no, its not awful. its great, and it protects the importance of your vote. its also uniquely american and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the founding fathers. 
first of all, shes probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. she may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. 
states dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. if there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. if the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots arent counted. 
who votes by absentee ballot? students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. the historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33 republican. in 2000, when al gore won the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in california alone. a 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million republican vote advantage, so bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from californias uncounted absentee ballots alone! so much for gores 500,000 popular vote victory. that was the headline on the n.y. times, and it was the lead story on nbc nightly news, right? no? youre kidding. 
getting back to the win the popular votelose the electoral college scenario thank g-d we have that, or else california and n.y. would determine every election. every time. 
but the electoral college brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do madison ave. execs and factory workers in tennessee. 
shortcomings? sure. the e.c. can make an r vote meaningless in a very few heavily d states or vice versa. but without the electoral college, the countrys entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states.  american thinker comment on this article via your facebook account comment on this article via your disqus account follow us on facebook!",0,736281,real

"boom! former secretary of defense canada puts bomb under corrupt banking system! posted by madeline  oct 26, 2016  2016 , daily blog  0  thanks gre!
bovendien 
former defense minister of canada, paul hellyer, has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty. ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement, a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet. paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement. with this convention, which comes out of the hat of the international bankers, 62 families will obtain control over almost the entire world. constitutions of member countries will no longer apply, only the will of the 62 families the elite will apply. 
the lawsuit was officially filed on october 21 of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments; the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign, execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels. 2 the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forum-protected by the division of powers under the constitution act, 1867 
most of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law, 1867 the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes; and 
ceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system, and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms , and over-rides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health, education, social services, and public utilities-including the elimination of subsidies, monopolies, and state enterprises for public welfare. in short, the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens. 
various provisions of ceta violated constitutional built-rights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health, education, social services and public funds, including the termination of subsidies , monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest. in short, the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants. 
but this is not all! paul hellyer, which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world, his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world, the international bankers, international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only 62 families. 
paul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers, yet not so long ago. until 1974 the canadian government expressed its money itself, there was no such thing as inflation, poverty and debt. canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time. life was good, cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do. from one day to the issued money creation in 1974 the central banks and money was no longer free. within a few years, canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes. paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend. this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education, health, housing, etc. can be paid without causing debts. paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version! he lets no grass grow, does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years, paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat. 
now the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this. 
dear readers. this could be the big break. this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers, the same applies. we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people. the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it. we want a better and fairer world, then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for! 
privatized money is the reason for all wars, privatized money is the cause of poverty, oppression, exploitation, neglect of our elderly and less fortunate. privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet. now is the chance to get out from under the yoke, to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children. now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over 100 years with one goal, to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer.

"money laundering scheme exposed 14 pro-clinton super pacs, nonprofits implicated theres a reason david brock, founder of the liberal group media matters for america, chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super pacs and nonprofits.
professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts. brock wants his unregistered solicitor, the bonner group, to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason.
david brock is laundering money 
 
related stories consumers need protection from new consumer protection bureau rule heres what the markets are telling us exposed profiteers of governing  and these are the ones who got caught! brock has seven nonprofits, three super pacs, one 527 committee, one llc, one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in washington .
uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations.
the bonner group, his professional solicitor, works off a commission. every time money gets passed around, bonner receives a 12.5 percent cut.
 
follow the money 
nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants.
but they arent required to disclose who gives them cash grants.
this weak system of one-way verification is being abused by brock. hes been cycling money between his organizations for years, and the bonner groups 12.5 percent commission gets triggered after every pass.
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias, trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency in 2014, media matters for america raised more than 10 million.
the bonner group was credited for raising these funds. media matters paid it a 1.1 million commission.

that same year, media matters gave a 930,000 cash grant to brocks franklin education forum , an organization that shares office space with media matters.

in 2014, the franklin education forum reported 994,000 in total contributions, and 93.6 percent of that total came from media matters.
surprisingly, though, the franklin education forum gave full credit to bonner for raising that money. it paid the fundraiser a 124,250 commission in 2014.

notice what happened? 
brocks media matters gave a 930,000 cash grant to brocks franklin education forum. brocks franklin education forum credited the bonner group for raising those funds, triggering the 12.5 percent commission. brock paid the bonner group a 124,250 commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself! it doesnt stop there 
after the franklin education forum retained 869,750, it sent a 816,224 cash grant to brocks franklin forum . 

note the franklin education forum is a 501c3, and the franklin forum is a 501c4. they are not the same company. 
the franklin forum 501c4 paid bonner a commission in 2013 , so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a 102,028 commission in 2014. unfortunately, its hard to tell for sure. it still hasnt filed its taxes for 2014!
lets recap 
say, for example, you donate 1,062,857 to media matters for america. this is how david brock would have used your charitable donation in 2014
media matters would receive your 1,062,857 donation. the bonner group would earn a 132,857 commission. media matters would retain 930,000. next, media matters would give whats left of your entire donation , 930,000, to the franklin education forum. the bonner group would earn a 116,250 commission. the franklin education forum would retain 813,750. the franklin education forum would then forward the remaining 813,750 to the franklin forum. the bonner group would earn a 101,718 commission. the franklin forum would retain 712,031. in the end, brocks solicitor would have pocketed 350,825, almost a third of your initial donation. thats a far cry from the advertised 12.5 percent commission.
as bizarre as that scenario may sound, this is exactly what brock did in 2014.
how can we be sure this is intentional? 
brock is the chairman for each of these organizations. how could he not know whats going on?
hes a hands-on chairman. according to their tax returns, brock allocates time, weekly, to his organizations
media matters 31.50 hours per week franklin education forum three hours per week the franklin forum one hour per week furthermore, the new york times reports that brock shares a summer rental in the hamptons with mary pat bonner, the president of the bonner group.
brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this. these transfers are intentional. he vacations with his solicitor. case closed.
still not convinced? 
brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers. they all share the same number.

what if ? 
we even located the bonner groups solicitation agreement with media matters on floridas gift givers guide . clarification on the commission can be found on page 2

in english contractually, brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission. in spite of this option, he intentionally chooses to trigger the 12.5 percent commission for money grants between his organizations.
note yes, we are making the assumption that all of brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the bonner group. given that his organizations share the same address, board members and telephone number, we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement. 
this barely scratches the surface 
utilizing public-facing tax returns, along with records submitted to the federal election commission, we mapped out all the significant money transfers from 2014 that took place in brocks office

summary 
this is all from just one year! no further commentary required.
we understand this may be hard to believe. we first came across this in july, and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it.
all of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources. check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in brocks office. these data have been sitting out in the open, gathering dust for years. 
if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.
weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity. but there arent any loopholes. david brock has something to hide. just last month, the daily caller reported the following
brocks former long-time live-in boyfriend william grey whom brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the irs with damaging information about how brock was running his media matters empire. what did brock do? he paid grey 850,000 to keep quiet. brock reportedly had to sell his home in rehoboth, delaware, to come up with the money. this certainly seems to indicate that brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover.
adding to this, fox news reported the following
grey accused brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine brocks fundraising efforts.
next step is i contact all your donors and the irs, grey wrote in an email dated may 19, 2010. this is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.'
we believe that the information presented in this article is what has brock so terrified. we feel confident in saying, with close to absolute certainty, that david brock is laundering money through his media matters conglomerate.

"media claim trump transition chaos. trump's way ahead of schedule.  daily wire media claim trump transition chaos. trump's way ahead of schedule. by ben shapiro november 18, 2016 
the media, desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming trump administration as dangerously incompetent, are once again overplaying their hands. instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that trump relies heavily on his son-in-law, jared kushner, and his daughter, ivanka  he invited them to a state meeting with japan  theyre trying to claim that he just isnt moving fast enough on appointments. 
thats nuts. 
barack obama didnt name his picks for secretary of state, defense, or attorney general until december 1, nearly a month after the november 4, 2008 election. george w. bush didnt name his picks for state, defense, or attorney general until mid-december december 16 for colin powell, december 28 for donald rumsfeld, december 22 for john ashcroft. bill clinton didnt name his picks for those positions until at least december 22. george h.w. bush was the fastest off the mark  he named james baker secretary of state the day after the november 8 election. ronald reagan waited until december 11 to get started; jimmy carter waited until december 3. 
were still waiting on trumps state and defense picks, but hes already out of the gate with senator jeff sessions for attorney general. its november 17. 
the media are so eager to bury trumps administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so. instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks  steve bannon, for example, is a rotten pick , but not because hes a racist or anti-semite  the media keep proclaiming the end is near. this sort of alarmism doesnt convince americans, who dont really see why theres any giant rush to appoint people who arent going to be formally considered by the senate until january 20 anyway. 
if this election was about repudiation of the media  and it was  the media arent doing themselves any favors when they promulgate fact-free narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets fake news. for years, americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day. each day, the media seem determined to prove them right. tags",43,736286,real

washington, dc the fbi on tuesday released documents related to a now-closed federal investigation of an alleged pay-to-play scheme involving bill clinton and the clinton foundation. 
the documents, which are heavily redacted, regard the investigation of clintons last-minute pardon of marc rich, a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the u.s. for tax evasion. 
the jan. 20, 2001 pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandal-plagued clinton administration. richs ex-wife, denise, donated more than 1 million to various clinton and democratic entities, including the democratic national committee, hillary clintons new york senate campaign and the clinton foundation. 
the release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized. but the dump is noteworthy for two reasons. it reminds voters that the clinton white house and clinton foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning pay-to-play allegations. the clinton foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple fbi field offices. 
the fbi issued a statement late tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a foia request.

"desperate obama rips comey 'we don't operate on innuendo'  daily wire desperate obama rips comey 'we don't operate on innuendo' by november 2, 2016 
barack obama must be pretty worried. 
earlier this week, white house press secretary josh earnest told the media that fbi director james comeys decision to reopen an investigation into hillary clinton didnt spring from bias or politics. he explained  
director comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the fbi was considered by the united states senate... they speak to his good character and the president's assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed. for example, the president doesn't believe that director comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election. and the president doesn't believe he's secretly supporting a candidate or political party. he's in a tough spot. he's the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties. 
now, with the polls closing to within the margin of error, president obama has had second thoughts. he told nowthisnews  
i do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks. we operate based on concrete decisions that are made. when this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the fbi, the conclusion of the justice department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable. 
its worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here  obamas entire administration has been built on innuendo. his department of justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism. his irs used innuendo to destroy conservative 501c3s. his entire 2012 campaign was rooted in innuendo about mitt romneys supposed secret evils. 
but more than anything, the obama flip here shows serious desperation. what changed? the polls. on monday, it looked like the fbi scandal would detract from hillarys polling numbers, but wouldnt kill her. now it looks like she might go down in flames. this shows how faithless obama is  comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened hillarys chances, at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo. 
if comey has any stones, he should resign in protest at obamas accusations. hes already been thrown under the bus by his commander-in-chief for not playing dead for him long enough to move hillary into the white house. hes got no future in his position no matter what he does. it would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell obama and his cronies to stuff it now. tags",43,736270,real

"trumps campaign backfires as hillary clinton attracts millions of new voters by jason easley on thu, oct 27th, 2016 at 218 pm donald trump promised that he would bring millions of new republicans voters into the election, but polling in swing states shows that it is hillary clinton who is getting new voters out to support her.   
donald trump promised that he would bring millions of new republicans voters into the election, but polling in swing states shows that it is hillary clinton who is getting new voters out to support her. 
within their discussion of a new pennsylvania poll showing clinton leading trump by 7 points, the new york times reported 
mrs. clinton has an 18-point lead among voters who did not participate in the 2012 election, according to our estimates, which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data. she fares even better among white voters who didnt vote in 2012 than she does among white voters who did. its a pattern that has been true across all of the upshotsiena surveys in florida, north carolina and pennsylvania. 
there has not been an influx of new voters who might help mr. trump. according to our estimates, mrs. clinton has a 16-point lead among newly registered voters. 
the idea that trump was bringing millions of new voters to the republican party was always a myth. 
donald trump got the most votes of any candidate in a republican presidential primary. trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a republican primary. trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his partys primary ballots cast against him. 
hillary clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters, and without a doubt, some of those voters have been motivated by donald trumps campaign. 
trump was right. he has brought millions of new voters to the polls. what he neglected to tell republicans is that they are coming for hillary clinton.",133,736264,real
"us feigns human rights concerns in philippines  new eastern outlook column politics philippine president rodrigo duterte is heading a controversial campaign against crime, embodied in his war on drugs which has led to violence spanning the nations troubled urban centers. president dutertes comments have ranged from reasonable, to utterly indifferent regarding fears of extrajudicial executions, vigilantism, and very real human rights abuses  opening a door of opportunity for his political opponents both at home and abroad. president dutertes inability to clearly condemn extrajudicial executions and vigilante violence, along with his inflammatory, provocative, even dangerously demagogic statements both invites further abuses, as well as both legitimate and opportunistic criticism of him, his administration, and his policies. while legitimate criticism is both necessary and justified, it is undermined by disingenuous political opportunism, wielded by hypocrites who only stand to compound the philippines current crisis, not solve it. america the humane? among president dutertes more opportunistic political opponents is the united states. while the united states would otherwise be justified and morally grounded in its criticism of president dutertes administration, there are some current and past complications that reveal such criticism as stark hypocrisy, crass opportunism, and even the cynical political exploitation of abuse, rather than any genuine attempt to constructively address or stop it. the most recent manifestation of americas feigned concern regarding the philippines ongoing campaign against accused illicit narcotic dealers was the blocking of a shipment of us-made rifles destined for philippine police units. some 26,000 rifles were on order before being blocked by the us senate based on concerns about human rights violations. these concerns, however, have not prevented the us from selling billions of dollars worth of weapons, including warplanes, munitions, tanks, and helicopters to saudi arabia, who is using this vast us-made arsenal to oppress its own people and execute a war of aggression against neighboring yemen. saudi arabia is also admittedly involved in arming and funding terrorist organizations in syria and iraq, including with us-made weapons  particularly anti-tank tow missiles. this hypocrisy exposes us concerns as merely politically motivated, designed to put pressure on manila in an effort to reassert us influence over the southeast asian state. not only has the us previously enjoyed greater influence over the philippines since the end of world war ii, but before the war, and for half a century, the united states literally controlled the philippines as a us territory. it seized the philippines in a bloody 1899-1902 war that claimed the lives of over a quarter of a million people  some sources estimate over half a million , and initiated an occupation marked by brutality, oppression, and torture, including the introduction of water boarding then called water curing conducted by the us as a means of attitude adjustment for local philippine leaders. it is ironic and telling that both water boarding and attempts by the us to maintain influence over the philippines both persist to this day. attempts by the us to predicate its desire to control manila on concerns about human rights violations not only is bitterly ironic, it undermines those genuinely attempting to expose and stop real abuses taking place amid the philippines current crisis. president duterte has been able to insulate himself from criticism precisely because of us hypocrisy and meddling. had independent, local activists and media platforms  networked with regional and international organizations  attempted to expose and rein in president dutertes anti-crime campaign, it would have been immeasurably more difficult to dismiss the facts and continue with impunity. the us has in essence discredited genuine human rights concerns by hijacking them for self-serving political objectives. extrajudicial executions, vigilante violence, and president dutertes indifference, even defense of both, needs to be opposed  but by the people of the philippines  not disingenuous, exploitative, and self-serving foreign interests who are not only notorious human rights abusers today  worldwide  but who have carried out campaigns of extermination, torture, and human rights abuses in the philippines itself, as a foreign conqueror and occupier. for president duterte, it is more than possible for him to lead a more dignified and just campaign against criminals operating across the philippines. nations like singapore have used stern, popular, but legitimate judicial measures to rein in the drug trade and organized crime, so can the philippines. doing so would close this door of opportunity president duterte himself opened to the americans, and leaves open with his current policies. tony cartalucci, bangkok-based geopolitical researcher and writer, especially for the online magazine  new eastern outlook.  popular articles",98,736284,fake
"yes, the religious right warns witchcraft could decide this election by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat, oct 29th, 2016 at 841 pm ""that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released""   
coming from people who believe in something called spiritual warfare a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions  it is perhaps no surprise that the religious right should declare that their messiah  donald trump  is being threatened with witchcraft. 
lance wallnau, whose twitter page claims to be your spiritual warfare guide to the 2016 election, appeared on the jim bakker show to push the crazy idea that many christians feel this fog on their head at times and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released. 
watch courtesy of right wing watch 
oh sweet baby jesus, the mighty lance has struck out. what has happened, of course, is that the religious right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion. its no wonder they feel in a fog . metaphorically or physically, theyre selling their souls. 
wallnau claims the left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of christ who doesnt work together, and thats the dilemma that americas in right now, even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the religious right has been organizing since goldwater lost in 64 . 
a hypocrite just cant catch a break, it seems 
the web literally is coming down on america. and whats sad is, how many christians feel this fog on their head at times? do you feel that? its almost like everythings going wrong. we dont realize its a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the american culture and discipling the country. and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released. 
wherever theres agreement, theres power. the more unbelievers agree with the narrative that theyre hearing, the more power and authorization satan has to manifest. so unless the church has an exposure of what the enemys doing and begins to agree together with a counter-strategy, were going to deal with more and more fog. and the worst part iswe dont have to surrender nations to the devil. 
so if you disagree with wallnau, if you oppose trump, it can only because youre manifesting the power of satan who in the old testament is gods lieutenant, not his adversary. so pick your testament, i suppose. 
lance wallnau insists he is not a big conspiracy theorist buff, but this doesnt do anything to convince us hes not some wack-a-doodle instead. this is nothing new, as a non-christian being told that you represent a devil you dont even believe exists. 
there are 2,000 years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize or worse their opponents. 
without charges of satanism and witchcraft, you dont have the genocide of european and middle eastern paganism; you dont have anti-jewish pogroms; and you dont have the crusades or the spanish inquisition; you dont have witch-burnings. 
what this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that were not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents. 
not only do they deal in a conspiracy-laden world, a world free of facts, but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason  and lets go ahead and say sanity  do not. 
lets face it donald trumps biggest enemy is not satan, but donald trump himself. and wallnau can claim believers have an edge all they want, but all the belief in the world wont overturn reality.",133,736267,real

"ben shapiro destroys john oliver on abortion and trump  daily wire ben shapiro destroys john oliver on abortion and trump by hank berrien october 27, 2016 
on thursday, on his daily podcast, daily wire editor-in-chief ben shapiro decimated hbo host and supposed comedian john oliver for his comments regarding donald trump's comments on abortion during the third presidential debate. 
shapiro began, ""hbos john oliver belongs to a class of british people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent. they think that because they share an accent with rex harrison from my fair lady this makes them geniuses."" 
he continued 
so john oliver does a political show on american politics; he doesnt know much about american politics; he doesnt know much about politics generally; but hes been feted by the media because hes a comedian whos wildly to the left. so just like president obama is going to be interviewed by samantha bee, who is legitimately the least funny person in human history, she and trevor noah actually have a cage match next week to determine whos the least funny person in human history. both of them i believe, beat stalin for that title a while back, so now were going to unify the championships, so obamas going to be on with samantha bee, where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortions wonderful. 
john oliver was ripping on donald trump the other day at some awards ceremony, and because hes british, that means were supposed to pay attention to him, even though we fought a revolution so we wouldnt have to pay attention to the brits. heres john oliver talking about abortion 
the screen then showed oliver pontificating 
in terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important; we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of late-term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work, no clear understanding of the basic biology of womens bodies, and a very poor sense of grammar as well. so i guess we got, in a sense, what we were asking for. if you ask donald trump to draw a fallopian tube, i cannot imagine what you would get back other than a childs drawing of a cobra. 
shapiro fired back 
okay. i would hesitate to ask john oliver to draw a fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here, because he obviously doesnt know. now look, i criticized trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasnt graphic enough. but let me, for those who missed it, explain what exactly happens in a late-term abortion, which is what he was talking about, okay? what happens in a late-term abortion, what happens in a late-term abortion, is something completely awful; this is according to americanpregnancy.org., okay? not a right-wing pro-life website americanpregnancy.org ""the fetus is rotated; forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs, shoulders and arms through the birth canal. a small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside. the catheter removes the cerebral material, that would be the brains, until the skull collapses. the fetus is then completely removed. 
shapiro continued to explain the barbaric procedure 
okay, thats one procedure thats used; thats dilation and extraction. in late-term abortions it usually one of these two; dilation and evacuation or dilation and extraction. dilation and evacuation the baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it; sometimes they dont use such injections; then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the childs body in the womb, and remove it piece by piece. 
then he proceeded to carve up oliver 
so i guess that donald trump could have been more graphic; i dont know that john oliver would have enjoyed that, but he could have been more graphic, i suppose. but this is what they do, laugh it up, oh, he cant draw a fallopian tube."" 
okay, john draw an abortion. really. draw it; lets see it. i want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and i want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. its not waving a magic wand, and its not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing. i want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb. i would like to see that. ""okay, john draw an abortion. really. draw it; lets see it. i want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and i want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like."" ben shapiro 
shapiro concluded 
but of course hell never do that, other than, ""it might look like a cobra; it might look like a cobra; maybe itll look like a princess, waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina. the fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to child-killing is absolutely ridiculous and despicable.

"in only 50 years humans are close to killing off two-thirds of all wildlife we are change 
two-thirds of wild animals will vanish by 2020, largest mass extinction since dinosaurs. 
at some point the earth is going to say enough. a damning new report from the world wildlife fund has found a precipitous decline in the worlds animal populations as thousands of species scramble to survive against a sole enemy humans.
the 2016 version of wwfs biennial living planet report , published thursday, found a 58 percent overall decline in vertebrate populations from 1970 to 2012, the latest year with available data. the nonprofit warned that if current trends continue, the world could lose more than two-thirds of wildlife by 2020.
as humanity continues to demand more and more of the earth and puts pressures on our natural capital, what were seeing is the fraying of wildlife, said colby loucks , senior director for the wwfs wildlife conservation program. 
humans have affected the entire spectrum of vertebrate life ? fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, the report says. the documents warning of vanishing wildlife refers to total population size, not the number of species that will go extinct. thats an entirely different problem .

loucks linked wildlife losses to what he called the five horseman of the environmental apocalypse habitat loss, over exploitation, pollution, invasive species and climate change. those factors have undercut the 3,706 species documented by the wwf on land and in ocean and freshwater habitats.
freshwater species have been hit hardest, with populations declining 81 percent, according to the report. the freshwater biome covers less than a 0.01 percent of the planets surface, but holds about 1 in 10 known wildlife species.
theres less of the cuddly panda phenomenon going on there, because humans need water to survive, to grow crops, loucks said, noting that oftentimes we see freshwater for human use, and not for conservation. 
why are there massive die offs of different species of animals around the world ? 
humanity has expanded so much ? clear-cutting rainforests , poaching big game , overfishing the seas ? that it now requires the equivalent of 1.6 earths to provide the goods and services we use each year, the report says.
wwf ranks what it calls the ecological footprint of this consumption ? basically the amount of resources a human lifestyle requires in a defined region. rich nations, including the united states, canada and australia, have some of the biggest footprints in the world.
i dont think people really know the extent of these declines, loucks said. ultimately, were going to need collective action to try and maintain both humans and what we need, as well as the natural world.

i dont think people really know the extent of these declines, loucks said. ultimately, were going to need collective action to try and maintain both humans and what we need, as well as the natural world. 
other major endeavors this year documenting animal populations have revealed similarly shocking declines. the first full census of african elephants found a 30 percent drop across the continent in just seven years. wide swaths of australias great barrier reef have become a coral graveyard . even the loneliest frog on earth died , a symbol of the extinction crisis. 
the wwf report says theres still time to stop mass extinction. major worldwide initiatives to halt climate change and recent shifts toward renewable energy ensure we are not starting from scratch, the report says.
the facts and figures in this report tend to paint a challenging picture, yet there is still considerable room for optimism, the report reads. if we manage to carry out critically needed transitions, the rewards will be immense. 
changes should include a revamped food system that balances human need with planetary capacity.
sustainability and resilience will be achieved much faster if the majority of the earths population understand the value and needs of our increasingly fragile earth, the report says. a shared understanding of the link between humanity and nature could induce a profound change that will allow all life to thrive. 
loucks noted that such changes are really, really hard and mandate long-term thinking.
when were going to start seeing impacts more locally, your favorite lake dries up or your favorite species is no longer there, maybe at that point you start thinking longer term, he said. e ach individual is going to have their threshold when theyre going to start saying, wow, i care.

a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law. 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable, wrote justice tom parker this week. federal judges, as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v. hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to same-sex marriage, are unaccountable and unelected. 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting u.s. supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected. chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were, consequently, unaccountable. 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning, history, tradition, the courts own rules, or the rule of law, but upon their empathetic feelings.' 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges, he said. 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore, who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriage-based case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case, which created same-sex marriage nationwide, was announced. 
moore, who is challenging the punishment, insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves. they did, with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments. 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel, because retired judges, too, are unelected and unaccountable. 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda, instead of faithfully applying the rule of law, parker warned. obergefell is not the first case concerning same-sex marriage to prove this principle true. before the united states supreme court decided obergefell, the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states. 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book, now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family? 
before obergefell, 40 states passed laws affirming traditional marriage. in 37 of those states, the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional. of the 37 state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts, 24 of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional. each of the 24 courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable. 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account, citing the situation that developed in iowa. 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional. the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa. however, although the judges are initially appointed, they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires. 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted one-man-one-woman marriage as law, in april 2009, in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism, the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional. 
the very next year, three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election; all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa. this was the first time since iowa adopted its retention-election system that any judge had ever failed to be retained. the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law. 
mathew staver, chairman of of liberty counsel, which is representing moore, said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case. 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law. he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law, he said. 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable. at every turn, this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama. never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired. we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution. the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the 9-0 vote. never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule 16 has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term. a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a four-page order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life. this is not right. 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart, who has been acting as alabamas chief justice. 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore. 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization. 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics, fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary, they will no doubt take our complaint seriously, as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore, said tom ford, a spokesman for the group. 
the complaints, the group said, outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety, failed to perform the duties of her office impartially, failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary. 
daniel horowitz , senior editor at conservative review, told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation. 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues, whether its the bureaucrats, whether its the courts, and as it relates to even religious liberty, even property rights, immigration, our voting rights, who gets to vote, he said. 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america. 
how did we get here? horowitz asked rhetorically. and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this. this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges, the legal profession, and unelected bureaucrats. that is social transformation without representation, which, as scalia warned, is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution. 
same-sex marriage was mandated for the nation in 2015 by the bare 5-4 majority made up of anthony kennedy, ruth ginsburg, stephen breyer, sonia sotomayor and elena kagan. john roberts, clarence thomas, samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it. 
the majority found in the constitution a right to same-sex marriage, overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states. 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the u.s. supreme court majority. 
for one, two of the justices in the majority, kagan and ginsburg, were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for same-sex marriage, apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality. without their votes, the case would have gone the other way. 
they refused. 
then there was the u.s. supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier, in the defense of marriage act case, in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage. 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people. 
as wnd reported , ginsburg, who voted in favor of same-sex marriage, has performed same-sex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements. justice elena kagan also has performed same-sex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm. 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case, but they refused to acknowledge the request. the foundation explained that canon 3a6 of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court. 28 u.s.c. sec 455a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. 
rabbi jonathan cahn, author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah 910 judgment movie, has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage. 
at a prayer event in washington, he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage. that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation. 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained. 
justices, can you judge the ways of god? there is another court and there is another judge, where all men and all judges will give account, he warned. 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty, should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation? we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal, he said. 
see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol. 
the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling same-sex marriage an intrinsic evil. 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court. 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee, boston college, kansas state, notre dame, university of texas, villanova, vanderbilt, hillsdale, university of nebraska, catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of same-sex marriage as anti-constitutional and illegitimate. 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states, said the statement from the american principles project . 
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case. to recognize the authority of states to define marriage, and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions. to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons. to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell.",238,736264,real

for all the fact-free cable news punditry this week about supposed momentum on the part of donald trump, its easy to miss the fact that hillary clinton is overwhelmingly likely to win the election according to every polling average and predictive model. but even as trump supporters and the pundits continue pointing to the turnout at his rallies many of which are in states hes losing, it turns out hillary clinton just pulled off one of the biggest crowds of the entire election  and she did it in a key red state. 
hillary clinton held a rally in arizona today, a state that hasnt been won by a democrat in a presidential election in a generation. its a sign that shes still playing offense. and shes within the margin of error in the polling averages in arizona, a sign of strength. moreover, she managed to draw a crowd of twenty thousand people in the red state tonight, a sign of momentum. adam parkhomenko posted a photo to facebook which captured the sheer size of the outdoor crowd 
meanwhile hillary clinton will be in north carolina on thursday and pennsylvania and michigan on friday, even as bernie sanders heads to ohio and president barack obama heads to florida. if you enjoy daily news bin, consider making a contribution contributed by daily news bin staff 14728",40,736271,fake
"fox news just admitted it made up story about hillary being indicted for foundation comments 
the alt-right and other trump supporters were flush with excitement yesterday as their online echo chamber resounded with stories that hillary clinton was about to be indicted on the basis of the newly discovered emails on anthony weiners computer. today, of course, we learned that this was nothing but a bold-faced lied. while many of the more obscure right -wing blogs named nothing but imaginary sources to support their outrageous claims , the most legitimate source of the false story was none other than fox news. 
on november 2 fox news bret baier claimed that, according to two anonymous sources within the fbi, the agencys investigation of clinton would continue to likely an indictment. the very next day reality forced him to walk back those claims, which he called inartful, acknowledging that thats not the process. 
nonetheless, baier did not entirely disavow his ruse of an imminent clinton indictment, maintaining that there is confidence in the evidence. given that clintons indictment has been impending for months in the right-wing universe one would think that these shameless schemers would have wised up to the fact that its not going to happen  and for good reason . instead, every time there is the slightest mention of clintons emails, no matter how vague and clearly inconsequential , the alt-right rumor mill kicks into overdrive on its vicious crusade to smear the potential first female president in any way possible. 
in reality, there is absolutely nothing so far to suggest that there is anything incriminating in the most recent batch of clinton emails, and it has become increasingly clear that fbi director james comeys announcement of the renewed investigation was nothing but a cynical and hypocritical political ploy. in part the announcement was designed to fuel a new republican storyline that clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is under federal investigation. the demagogues making these claims conveniently ignore the fact that trump is under investigation in no fewer than 75 cases , including the rape of a 13 year-old girl. 
another disconcerting storyline in yesterdays firestorm of right-wing rumors is the political interference of trump supporters in the fbi. if baiers so-called anonymous sources really were fbi agents, it would represent yet another recent example of meddling in the presidential election by trump supporters at the supposedly impartial agency. in any case, the endless lies and distortions of the right-wing pseudo-media, from fox news down to the lowliest blog, are doing a tremendous disservice to the american people.",125,736272,fake

"snowflake colbert didnt want to write jokes about trump winning  daily wire snowflake colbert didnt want to write jokes about trump winning by hank berrien november 21, 2016 
conversing with fellow daily show comic john oliver at the montclair film festival on saturday night, late show unfunny host stephen colbert admitted that he couldnt even conceive that donald trump would win the presidency; so much so that he couldnt write jokes bout trump winning for election night. 
in the roughly two-hour discussion and qa titled wow, that was weird, montclair film festival executive director tom hall set the somber tone by allowing, ""when we planned this evening, i think we all thought we'd be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face."" 
speaking of the late show s election night special on showtime, colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired 
there was not a bear big enough in the world that we weren't loaded for. we were so loaded for every possible eventuality. we had so many guests. we had so many pre-taped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. we had three shows hillary clinton wins and we know; hillary clinton wins and we dont know, because its not called before the shows over; donald trump's going to win and we dont know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. that's not wishful thinking, that's what everyone was saying. 
and then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is donald trump is going to win and we know he's going to win. my execs and my writers were like, you don't want to write something for that? and i'm like, no! there is nothing you can write. you don't understand. i have 400 people in my theater. if we know donald trump is going to win, it's going to be like doing stand-up comedy for one of those chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. there will be no laughter! we only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, f it, it's going to be him, let's just talk for another hour. so i think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. 
colbert moaned that the special was ""the hardest thing i've ever done in my life,"" adding, ""i was tying my tie at 1030 and i went, 'oh, he took ohio. oh, well, we expected that. he took it by 11 points. wow! that's not expected.' and then over my guests' shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, 'florida, iowa, nebraska.'"" he revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but ""none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. our audience was sobbing openly. and those are people who work for me, like my cameramen."" 
as daily wire editor-in-chief ben shapiro pointed out years ago , colbert's manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives 
he engages in conservativeface. he needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative  after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. instead, he acts as though he is a conservative  an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. he out-archie bunkers archie bunker. his audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious colbert who wishes to persecute gays; they chortle at evil sexist colbert who thinks men are victims of sexism. this is the purpose of colberts routine. his show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. in order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks; in the same way, colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. 
on saturday night, colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a trump presidency, arguing, ""im all for giving him a chance, but dont give him an inch. because i believed everything he said, and i remember everything he said. and its horrifying. it's possible. the job changes a man. that's the cliche of the presidency."" he pontificated 
every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, well, there are levers of power in washington that can slow him down. but two things one is they're cowards. second is that the levers in washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. because they tried to stop trump. everybody tried to stop trump, do not delude yourself. 
everyone except the people he's going to appoint tried to stop him and they didn't. he owes them nothing. he goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, shall i do it? and they say, 'yes. and he says, it shall be so. and the balcony is twitter. he goes onto twitter and he goes, what do you think? do you think i'm right? that's what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn't. and he's a vindictive person. so it's all going to be fine. merry christmas. no! there is nothing you can write."" stephen colbert 
colbert concluded, ""the next person who says to me, 'you must be happy on a certain level, is going to have their eye carved out. 
so thats the man underneath the comedy mask . . .",43,736289,real
"comment on tainted measles vaccine kills more than 50 children in syria by tragic deaths used to promote vaccine fear  on the fence about vaccines photos credits social media the so called  opposition health authorities  said in a statement posted online in arabic 
primary investigations point to a limited security breach by vandals likely connected to the regime, which has been attempting to target the medical sector in free syria in order to spread chaos. the statement also added the syrian interim governments health ministry has instructed a halt to the second round of the measles vaccination campaign, which began monday september 15th  following several fatalities and injuries among children in vaccination centers in the idlib countryside. adnan hazouri, the health minister in the syrian opposition who held a conference in the arabic language said that he will resign if an investigation upheld allegations of negligence, as blood samples have been sent to turkey for analysis. the syrian observatory for human rights , which is based in london, also confirmed 
at least five children have died and 50 others are suffering from poisoning or allergic reactions after measles vaccinations in jirjanaz, in the idlib province. the following video shows affected children in saraqeb hospital in idlib, syria monther khalil, the head of the idlib medical department said this during an interview with radio hawa smart -an opposition related station established on gaziantep, turkey 
the department assures all parents who have had their children vaccinated that the vaccine is completely fine and there is no risk to children who have already been injected. 
we have already vaccinated 60,000 children against measles and there has been no previous problem. the same crews also previously carried out a polio campaign, where they vaccinated 252,000 children across seven rounds, and there were no abnormal complications. more than 190,000 syrians have been killed during the foreign-backed war since 2011, which has also created more than 3 million refugees outside syria. sources",32,736266,fake
"7 reasons i'll vote for trump print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov. 8. 
first, im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting, not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you. 
second, im not endorsing donald trump. in my mind, theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. 
third, i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro, bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore. 
fourth, i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were st. donald. i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings, constantly saying, let him who is without sin cast the first one see john 87. this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. 
fifth, my decision to vote for trump, barring something earth-shattering between now and nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been 1 during the gop primaries, i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices. i did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if trump won the nomination, i would re-evaluate my position. 2 once trump became the republican candidate, i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3 i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary. for two strong warnings about hillary, see here and here . 
so, what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump? 
the culture war is not over! gain hope, courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book, outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first, i believe that he actually is serious about appointing pro-life, pro-constitution supreme court justices. when he said during the last debate that if youre pro-life, you want to see roe v. wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flip-flop if elected. 
second, one reason i endorsed sen. ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both democratic and republican, to the point of calling it the washington cartel. trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although, unfortunately, hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system, so my vote for him is also a protest vote. 
third, i am voting for the republican platform, not the republican party, which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. 
fourth, while i have always felt that the line, were electing a president, not a pastor, was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, were electing a general to train hand-to-hand combat warriors, not a pastor, it might have more relevance. in other words, we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges, and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one. rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. and with things so messed up in america, the hand-to-hand combat analogy is closer to home. 
fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see, she a pro-abortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against late-term abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. since i have the opportunity to vote, i feel that i should vote for trump. 
sixth, trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump. yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a born-again christian i see absolutely no evidence of this, the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. 
seventh, although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house. in that context, i echo the words and warning of dr. martin luther king jr. the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. it must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority. 
so, in sum 1 my hope is in god, not donald trump, and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america; 2 my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation; 3 i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm; and 4 ultimately, the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump, while also praying that god will use him for good , not for evil. 
in the end, if trump gets elected and fails miserably, i will be grieved but not devastated. if he does well, i will rejoice. 
either way, though, my vote is just that a vote. my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution. receive michael brown's commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael brown's alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email. name",238,736264,real
"american irrationalism donald trump on the apprentice the false values of reality tv have been carried over into the current presidential race. nbc 
there is no shortage of signs of impending environmental catastrophe, including the melting of the polar ice caps and the rise of atmospheric carbon to above 400 parts per million . the planets sixth mass extinction is underway. it is not taking place because of planetary forces. homo sapiens is orchestrating it. we are at the same time bankrupting ourselves by waging endless and unwinnable wars. we have allowed our elites to push more than half the u.s. population into poverty and, often, profound despair through deindustrialization. we do nothing to halt the waves of nihilistic violence by enraged citizens who carry out periodic mass shootings in schools, malls, movie theaters and other public places. the political and financial elites flaunt their greed and corruption. donald trump appears to pay no federal income taxes. bill and hillary clinton use their foundation as a tool for legalized bribery. our largest corporations have orchestrated a legal tax boycott. the judicial system is a subsidiary of the corporate state. militarized police carry out public executions of unarmed people of color. our infrastructure, including our schools, roads and bridges, along with our deindustrialized cities, are in ruins. decay and rotphysical and moralare pervasive. 
we are blinded to our depressing reality by the avalanche of images disseminated by mass media. political, intellectual and cultural discourse has been replaced with spectacle. emotionalism and sensationalism are prized over truth. highly paid pundits who parrot back the official narrative, corporate advertisers, inane talk shows, violent or sexually explicit entertainment and gossip-fueled news have contaminated cultural life. reality television, as contrived as every other form of mass entertainment, has produced what might be called a reality presidential candidate. 
mass culture, because it speaks to us in easily digestible clich√©s and stereotypes, reinforces ignorance, bigotry and racism. it promotes our individual and collective self-glorification. it sanctifies nonexistent national virtues. it takes from us the intellectual and linguistic tools to separate illusion from truth. it is all show business all the time. 
advertisement square, site wide 
there are hundreds of millions of americans who know that something is terribly wrong. a light has gone out. they see it in their own suffering and hopelessness and the suffering and hopelessness of their neighbors. but they lack, because of the contamination of our political, cultural and intellectual discourse, the words and ideas to make sense of what is happening around them. they are bereft of a vision. austerity, globalization, unfettered capitalism, an expansion of the extraction of fossil fuels and endless war are not the price to be paid for progress and the advance of civilization. they are part of the savage and deadly exploitation by corporate capitalism and imperialism. they serve a neoliberal ideology . the elites dare not speak this truth. it is toxic. they peddle the seductive illusions that saturate the airwaves. we are left to strike out at shadows. we are enticed to succumb to the racism, allure of white supremacy and bigotry that always accompanies a culture in dissolution. 
we cannot, for this reason, discount the possibility that donald trump will be elected president. the election outcome will be decided by whatever emotion americans feel when they cast their ballots. 
celebrity narratives, manufactured pseudo-drama, sex scandals, natural disasters, insults and invective, mass shootings and war flash before us in a constant jumble of images on ubiquitous screens. the assault of images obliterates reality. a former congressman who sends a picture of himself in underwear to a woman is a national news story. sober examinations of our economic, foreign, judicial and environmental policies are dismissed as too complicated and boring. it does not produce engaging images. the electronic medias sole goal is to attract viewers and advertising dollars. it has conditioned us to demand an endless vaudeville act. 
we are infected because of this mass indoctrination by what daniel boorstin in  the image  a guide to pseudo-events in america calls social narcissism. the bottomless narcissism of trump and bill and hillary clinton cater to this social narcissism. they reflect back to us our desperate longing for, as well as celebration of, entertainment, celebrity, wealth, power and self-aggrandizement. it is not only advertising and public relations, as boorstin points out, that carries out the incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social narcissism. journalists, book publishers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, positive psychologists, self-help gurus, the christian right and talk show hosts all feed the mania for illusion. they all chant the insane mantra that reality is never an impediment to what we desire. we can have anything we want if we work hard, get an education, believe in ourselves, grasp that we are exceptional and believe the impossible is always possible. it is magical thinking. and magical thinking is the only real commodity the elites have left offer to us. make american great again. or america already is great. take your pick of idiotic clich√©s. 
we tyrannize and frustrate ourselves by expecting more than the world can give us or than we can make of the world, boorstin writes. we demand that everyone who talks to us, or writes for us, or takes pictures for us, or makes merchandise for us, should live in our world of extravagant expectations. we expect this even of the peoples of foreign countries. we have become so accustomed to our illusions that we mistake them for reality. we demand them. and we demand that there be always more of them, bigger and better and more vivid. 
the incessant search for instant gratification and the most appealing image, including the image of ourselves we manufacture for others on social media, has robbed us of the ability to examine ourselves and our society. it has extinguished the truth. the terminal decline of the american empire, the utter incompetence of our elites to manage everything from the ecosystem to the economy and foreign policy, the climate crisis, along with the widespread poverty and despair that defines over half of america, do not fit with the illusion. so these realities are blotted from public consciousness. the poor are rendered invisible. the climate crisis is ignored. the foreign policy debacles will be fixed with more bombs. a culture that can no longer discern or confront reality is unable to reform itself and dies. only the soviet and fascist dictatorships, along with the medieval catholic church, controlled thought as effectively.",207,736268,fake

"uk police six times more likely to stop and search black people videos uk police six times more likely to stop and search black people black people in britain are more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people, according to new official figures.  october 28, 2016 be sociable, share! stop and search has always been a controversial method used by police officers in england and wales and has always disproportionately targeted black and minority ethnic bme communities in britain. 
according to official figures released in 2013, 27 percent of stop and searches were not based on reasonable grounds for suspicion and concerns, as well as disproportionately targeting young people from bme backgrounds. 
in 2014, then-home secretary theresa may, decided to crack down on stop and search, penalizing police forces who used it and imposed restrictions on officers in 2014. 
a year later in 2015, the head of londons metropolitan police blamed an increase in knife crime on the home secretarys stop and search reforms. in the same year, the number of fatal stabbings increased by 18 percent in london.

while the latest figures released by the home office, reveal that the use of stop and search by police had reduced by more than a quarter across the board  stopping white people fell more sharply. 
the statistics reveal that people from bme backgrounds were still three times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people in 201516 and black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. 
amber rudd, britains relatively new home secretary, says the statistics are unacceptable yet added that the powers are vital for police to fight crime. 
a similar story has been seen for the black group, which fell from over six times more likely to just over four times more likely between the years ending march 31, 2011 and 2015, before rising again to over six times more likely in the year ending march 31 2016, the home office report said. 
shadow home secretary diane abbott, said the decline in stop and search clearly shows there is some effort to use these police powers more reasonably. but there are clear signs that some communities are being disproportionately targeted. 
amber rudd, the same home secretary who suggested companies draw up a list of their foreign workers, said that, no one should be stopped on the basis of their race or ethnicity.

"trump repeats bogus claim that captain khan would still be alive if he were president 58 pm again, donald trump was not opposed to the war in iraq.   
ever since donald trump was lambasted by leaders in both parties for fighting with a gold star family and dishonoring the service of captain humayun khan, hes been trying out a new approach pretending khan would still be alive if he was president. 
khan was killed in 2004 in a suicide attack in iraq. 
when the republican was asked in an interview with abcs george stephanopoulos if he thinks he should apologize for the way he treated the khan family following the democratic national convention, he repeated this bogus claim.

trump said, i have great respect for the khan family, i have great respect for  i mean their son is a great hero  but if i were president at that time, capt. khan would be alive today, george, because i wouldnt have been in iraq  i was opposed to the war in iraq. 
as hillary clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign, donald trump was not opposed to the war in iraq from the beginning. had he been president at the time, the war still would have taken place because trump was in favor of it. 
in fact, trumps campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies. this would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that america gets mired in more conflicts, not less. 
for their part, the clinton campaign has continued to stand up to trumps attacks on the khan family. in an emotional new ad released days ago, capt. khans father recounts how his son died protecting everyone in his unit. khans father asked of trump, would my son have a place in your america? 
the answer to mr. khans question is a resounding no, as trump has promised to ban muslims  like the khans  from even entering the united states. for those living here already, a president trump would treat them like criminals. 
donald trump will likely continue to rewrite history when it comes to his initial support of military intervention in iraq. but after spending so much time throwing mud at the khan family, its unlikely that anybody will buy it.",133,736264,real

"unprecedented bond dumping means u.s. dollar collapse ahead in collapse , economy  business , multimedia in the following interview, elijah johnson and silver doctors bring you the latest interview with someone we havent heard from in a while, dr. jim willie. to begin the financial portion of the interview, elijah begins by asking dr. willie about the unprecedented bond dumping by china and saudi arabia, and of course what elijah is referring to is how several weeks ago the markets witnessed never before seen numbers when 28 billion in u.s. treasuries were dumped one week, followed by another 23 billion a week or so later. 
consider the massive sell-offs just further evidence in a long line of existing examples regarding why the days of the u.s. dollar as the world reserve currency are numbered. our creditors are aware that the fed has been engaged in non-stop printing of money out of thin air, and even though the short-term effect has been the propping up of u.s. treasury prices, our creditors know history, something americans seems to pay no attention to. our creditors know that just like other countries who have engaged in the same kinds of reckless monetary policy in the past, eventually when the qe printing money out of thin air, is removed, hyperinflation will set in, and there will be massive devaluation of the same treasuries that were artificially propped up for so long. most creditors expect the qe to be shut off the moment this u.s. election is over, because unlike uninformed american voters, our creditors know that in addition to his role in allowing the largest case of massive voter fraud in america history to take place on his watch, captain transparency in the white house has made sure his loyal servant at the fed, janet yellen, has continued committing massive financial fraud at the fed at the same time. all of these actions by the u.s. result in what dr. willie refers to as psychological damage not just to the full faith and credit of the united states dollar, but to the united states itself. creditors of u.s. debt are watching a never before seen transition in the u.s. to a system of pure corruption, undermining any faith they might have had in the dollar, and giving them every reason in the world to want to distance them from the u.s. dollar. dr. willie explains that any perceived moral authority the u.s. once might have had is long gone. among other things, the world learned not long ago through a shocking revelation by wikileaks that obama and hillary not only knew of funds being used to provide isis our enemy, with weapons during a time of war, the world has now seen that barack obama and hillary allowed it. with almost a week until the official election we have heard tremendous stories of voter fraud including stories revealing as many as 2020 examples of machines switching votes from trump to hillary, we know the polls have been massively rigged, and thanks to a national media as corrupt and dishonest and those they are tasked with watching over, dr. willie briefly mentions millennials who were recently highlighted on the steven colbert show expressing their excitement that obamacare premiums are doubling in some states. the level of stupidity that is coming out of liberal indoctrination centers known as public schools or universities, where graduates have no ability to exercise critical thinking skills, is exactly why 20 college graduates are now living with their parents or grandparents, and michael snyder explains below. expect that number to keep climbing considerably, particularly with a clinton presidency. michael snyder writes in america today, more than 60 million people live in multi-generational households. that number is so large that it may seem difficult to believe, but the truth is that vast numbers of young adults have had to move back in with their parents and grandparents in recent years due to the deteriorating economy . millions of our young people cannot find decent jobs once they leave school, and millions of them are absolutely overwhelmed by debt. of course some of them are just lazy, but whatever the reason it is undeniable that multi-generational households are on the rise. according to the pew research center , 12 percent of the u.s. population was living in multi-generational households back in 1980. today, that number is up to 19 percent. that means nearly one out of every five u.s. adults now live with their parents or their grandparents. one of the big culprits, of course, is student loan debt.",195,736272,fake

this article was first published by the duran 
three years ago someones video parody of a  russian guys reaction  to a meteor falling over chelyabinsk went viral. russia today even included it into its reportage of how the russian dashcam videos become internet sensations 224. 
this 10 sec video had done more to project the toughness of russians than all the fireworks of vitaly churkins diplomatic rhetoric. hands down, churkin is brilliant and his speeches should be included into high school curriculum, however, due to peculiarities of the western supranational media, his oratorical talent remains largely unrecognized by a wider audience. yet, everyone remembers a video of a guy in a knitted cap, who just lowered a sun visor driving directly onto a collision path with a rapidly approaching celestial body. 
readers and commentators of the saker blog often express their frustration with the lack of immediate response to the western provocations from the russian government and society . why dont russias government respond by hitting them back hard and in kind? ask out readers. whereat we, russians, consider this to be our national character trait. rather than jumping nervously every time the west says boo! we keep steadfastly and resolutely moving forward despite of adversities. 
there is also a well calculated geopolitical dimension to this wait and observe stance chosen by the russias government every time washington comes up with a newly staged provocation. which is every monday, wednesday and friday, if i am not mistaken. washington here is being a working term to include pentagon, cia and also a slew of companies like

this is just a short snippet of a long list of willing participants in a division of a us military budget pie, which is now turned into a thriving and mushrooming industry of private constructors specializing in recognizance, intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis of sigint  finint in support of operations conus or oconus. 
we, of course, are mostly interested in operations that are being conducted oconus, which is outside of the continental us, also known as the rest of the world. in case you are wondering about the location of your country in relation to the us intelligence community. take the us military, plus the entirety of nato, some crafty old spy masters from britain, france, and germany, add to it hundreds of private and public enterprises, and you will understand where the plethora of false flag attacks, provocations, terror acts, civilian sabotage on the media, sports, kidnapping of russian citizens and other violations of the human rights of russians are coming from. 
in the last two weeks of october we watched a ukrainian civil airline dispatcher threaten to take down a civil aircraft from belarus. russia got pushed out of the un human rights council, after the generally proven-to-be-fake campaign of the white helmets , which are another of these private intelligence companies financed by nato members. 
we also were presented with the gruesome murder of one of the originators of so called  russian spring  in ukraine, known to the western audience as motorola. keeping in mind, of course, that the russian spring starting with the bolotnaya square protests, just like its predecessor the  arab spring , was engineered by western intelligence and military complexes. lets give credit where credit is due. 
all of these provocations, from big to small, from violent to ridiculous, all of them have one common goal, to draw the reaction of the russian government, to take its precious time, resources, and to disrupt its work. 
here comes the catch the more willing participants are being involved in designing and staging this torrid stream of provocations against russia, the less professional, less coordinated, and less convincing they are becoming. its exactly like with the famed musical cats which was perfectly choreographed on broadway, but watching it on a community theater stage would hurt your eyes in shame for the production crew and actors. 
by the fall of 2016, the saturation of provocative actions against russia has reached its critical stage. in other words, we had ceased reacting emotionally to them and have started analyzing them rationally. 
this explains the russian governments reaction to the multitude of recent provocative actions. a reaction that can be generally described as muted,low-key,hushed, and at least in one instance absent. 
knowing who or what is behind a provocation should warrant a type of response, if any. 
lets say, the justice department backtracks its perfidious demands for billions of dollars in fines arbitrarily imposed on deutsche bank, only after germany agrees to deploy its troops and tanks to the russian border. understandably, their move puts an adult population of russian into a sentimental mood summarized in lets finish the job our grandfather died doing. russias foreign ministry issues a warming statement, and the defense ministry moves a few troops closer to the western border, mirroring nato moves. the pentagon and cia issue memos to the all western media outlets stating the russian aggression. the western press copies these memos verbatim and propagates them in every nook and cranny of the free world. 
after that, the russian defense ministry releases information on successful testing of a new sarmat missile with some of its technical characteristics. youtube hosts several videos with detailed explanations of how it takes only two sarmats to destroy the east and west coasts of the us. they also specifically explain why sarmat is invincible to the western anti-missile systems. if you wonder how we got to this point, see the aforementioned information. 
everyone, privy to the latest russian military upgrades, which includes every youtube viewer, can see the russian government response to the attacks of the us banking system and wall street and the doj. 
we are witnessing a situation when hundreds of companies employing well over a million people who are trying to make themselves relevant in a crowded industry of war making, by producing torrents of events around the globe. they are the americans with gas cans setting fires around the globe, according to the memorable comparison made by rostislav ishchenko in his april 2015 article  what does putin want? 
he wrote  one can only guess who will be more effective  the americans with their gas can or the russians with their fire extinguisher?  
fire, however, dies quickly in the absence of oxygen. most of the anti-russian actions go unnoticed and just turn into white noise, but some manage to stand out in the news for a day or longer. in essence, they all vie for the russian government attention. maybe that gets them a yearend bonus and an annual contract renewal?

"mainstream media ignoring 75 lawsuits against trump to focus on clinton emails by hrafnkell haraldsson on tue, nov 1st, 2016 at 800 am ""last spring...new york had to take legal action to collect 8,578 in unpaid taxes on the trump-owned company that owns the trademark boeing 757""   
we looked yesterday at kurt eichenwalds revelation that donald trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails. that is hardly trumps only misdeed, but how many people realize that donald trump, at this moment, has 75  seventy-five  legal issues hanging over his head. 
hes lying 20 to 35 times a day and has his followers  and with much less excuse, the mainstream media  thoroughly distracted by the clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities. 
usa today reported at the end of october that just two weeks before election day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by usa today. 
it will surprise no one, because trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster , that one trump case, over non-payment of tips to caterers at trump soho hotel in new york city, is scheduled to go to trial a week before election day. 
if one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that trump does not pay his bills. earlier, we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts, having decided that the contractor had been paid enough, even though it wasnt the agreed-upon amount. trump got nailed by the court for 300k in attorneys fees in that case. 
just a few examples from usa todays investigation 
trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses angry members at his jupiter, fla. golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. theres a fraud case brought by trump university students who say the moguls company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course. trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. a disgruntled gop political consultant sued for 4 million saying trump defamed her. another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages. 
as pointed out by usa todays nick penzenstadler and john kelly, these lawsuits will dog trump into the white house, should he win. he will have no immunity because he is president. and america  and the world  will be treated to the spectacle of the president of the united states having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs. 
there are harassment cases, sex discrimination lawsuits, fraud, unpaid bills, racist comments, defamation, cases involving trump university. as usa today notes, as recently as last springnew york had to take legal action to collect 8,578 in unpaid taxes on the trump-owned company that owns the trademark boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country. 
and those 75 cases will likely grow. 
trump has promised, after all, to sue the new york times and each of the women  nymag maintains an exhaustive list  who have accused him of sexual assault. 
usa today says it spent six months researching court records. the exclusive analysis, they say, found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits. the cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the white house. 
donald trump claims clinton is tainted. he claims clintons emails are bigger than watergate. the other day tweeted , we must not let crookedhillary take her criminal scheme into the oval office. draintheswamp. 
this comes from the man who would turn the 1600 pennsylvania avenue into a morality no-go zone.

nobody is really supposed to know about me.-aaron black 
so brad, and bob, and lux, and myself are all part of the old school method where, it doesnt matter what the freakin legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherfker. -aaron black 
in regards to the donald duck characters showing up at trump events skalar clinton operative had gone to some buddy of his who is one of her body people and she explained the idea to hillary. and hillary just loved it. let me tell you something, i think she has the right instinct here. this thing is working, is resonating but that story is not exactly what you want to hear about how presidential decision-making happens. -robert creamer 
the coordination between the clinton camp, the dnc, and americans united for change is a rather obvious violation of federal campaign finance laws regarding expenditures. dnc chair donna brazile was also involved in the coordination with the clinton camp as well. 
additionally, robert creamer discussed why the donald duck idea had to be owned by aufc and not by the dnc. 
the duck has to be an americans united for change entity. this had to do only with some problem between donna brazile and abc, which is owned by disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. thats why. its really silly. 
later in the video creamer revealed why that is the case 
donna barzile had a connection with them and she didnt want to get sued. 
and finally, an explicit admission about hillarys desires, straight from creamer himself 
we originally launched this duck because hillary clinton wants the duck. 
watch the full video below 
this certainly seems to be illegal campaigning, based on these videos. one of the interns even stated that there was a whole slew of reasons why responsibilities had to be divvied up, because the whole scheme was a mess. and why is that? because they are violating campaign coordination law, so they have to. 
its truly unbelievable. a plethora of revelations now show us how corrupt hillary clinton and the dnc are, yet there are still millions of people that support them. if these revelations continue, and they still support her, what can you really say? 
when corruption penetrates this deeply, and when the citizens still wholeheartedly back those who are driving the corruption, the country is in serious danger.

this type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to republican leaders in 2016. as the campaign has gone on, the hateful and violent rhetoric, particularly from the man at the top of the republican ticket, has become increasingly worse. 
at one point this year, donald trump suggested that second amendment people should take up arms against clinton if she nominates a supreme court justices they dont like. he also said that hed like to see what happens if the democratic nominees bodyguards were disarmed. 
as cnn notes, trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language  or anything hes ever said or done  but burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed, although it does not excuse what he said. 
the comment i made was inappropriate, and i apologize for it, the republican senator said, according to cnn. 
this type of imagery has no place in our politics, regardless of whether its being said in public or private, especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward hillary clinton from trump supporters. 
whether its trump or burr, voters should remember their irresponsible language when they go to vote in just one week.",133,736269,real
"comment on white houses amazing response to westboro baptist church petitions image by cartier bracelet repliques subscribe 
one thing that seems to unite most americans is the collective disgust for the members of the westboro baptist church and their antics. many organizations and individuals have shown action in addressing this nuisance and that includes the creation of online petitions to the white house. see the five petitions  which call for the removal of westboro baptist churchs 501c3 status and legal recognition as a hate group  in the screen-capture below 
it took the white house a while to respond, but when they did, it was inspiring. in the official white response to westboro baptist church petitions , the white house explained that their options are limited. 
to the extent that these petitions request a particular law enforcement or adjudicatory action, we cannot issue a comment. in addition, as a matter of practice, the federal government doesnt maintain a list of hate groups. 
however, as is characteristic of our president and his administration, they found another way to respond to the westboro baptist church petitions  with a heartfelt message and visual. 
 one of the remarkable things about this set of petitions is that it shows just how strong the bonds that unite us can be. together, were more resilient than those who would try to drive us apart. 
the white house noted that the signers of the petitions were nationwide, but densely clustered in a couple of specific areas 
take, for instance, this map of all the signers of the petition legally recognize westboro baptist church as a hate group that we built with the zip codes that people chose to share with us when they signed. the darker color indicates a higher percentage of signers for that particular areas population. while support for these petitions came from all over the country, it was densely clustered in two places that have unique insight into the actions of the westboro baptist church  kansas, the state the church calls home, and newtown, connecticut, where the church threatened to picket the funerals of those killed at sandy hook elementary. 

the westboro baptist church makes a practice of picketing the funerals of activists, jewish leaders, gay people, soldiers, and.well, just about everyone. fred phelps,the leader of the group, is an attorney and is reputed by many sources to be a con-man who engages in controversial activities so that he can subsequently sue when officials, in their attempts to protect the rights of other people, violate the churchs rights. he is careful to not actually break the law 
the white house response is amazing and correct. the disrespect that the westboro baptist church shows our fallen soldiers serves to draw americans together in unity and respect for that which we hold sacred. 
the graves of our veterans are hallowed ground, and when men and women die in the service of their country and are laid to rest, it should be done with the utmost honor and respect.  president barack obama

"koch brothers helped incite the impending bloodbath among republicans by rmuse   757 pm ""if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half, i think its going to be just catastrophic.""   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a full-on civil war, and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the inter-party discord is its standard bearer donald j. trump. however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion-minded trump supporters, the real instigators are the koch brothers. 
although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon, they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed, the workings of government itself. the tea party caucus, an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a. boehner out of congress, morphed into the inaptly- named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job, although that is high on the trump supporters to-do list. 
as noted in wednesdays new york times,  mr. trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the anti-establishment energy that mr. trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down . 
the right-wing extremist that actually  took down  former house majority leader eric cantor, conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat, issued a warning to establishment republicans 
 theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to d.c. leadership comes and smacks our guy? thats where youre going to put down a marker? really? and the american people are just scratching their head saying, really? thats rich . 
brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton. 
donald trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump. in fact, besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump, it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy. and, during an interview with reuters he complained that  the people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top . win or lose, there is going to be a major blood-letting after the election and the establishment, although powerful, may face a herculean task to save the party. 
this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti-establishment devotee to run his campaign. the chairman of breitbart news, stephen bannon, had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber-conservative paradise. and uber-conservative is just a different way of saying a  non-government  according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism. dont believe it? 
two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers, heritage action for america and freedomworks , have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions; something establishment types are resisting. 
over the past few days, leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next, or new, speaker of the house; something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome. 
according to the chief executive of heritage action, michael needham, there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump. mr. needham said, 
 if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half, i think its going to be just catastrophe . 
another conservative extremist, house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said,  you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle.  
the dilemma for republicans after the election, no matter the outcome, is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party. that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses, big or small, the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump. if trump wins, the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november 8, it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans. 
the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger. after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative, and the past year-and-a-half of incitement by donald trump, the republican party faces a serious threat to its long-term survival. it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party.",133,736267,real
"identity politics in america a post-mortem here is what eight years of president obamas post-racial reign have wrought.
the weekend before election day, hillary clinton grinned from ear to ear at a cleveland rally while reciting a verse from jay-zs remix of young jeezys my president is black. as the rapper and his black lives matter-promoting wife, beyonce, beamed on stage nearby, pandersuit-clad clinton twanged with a stilted accent
remember, jay memorably said rosa parks sat so martin luther could walk, and martin luther walked so barack obama could run, and barack obama ran so all the children could fly.'
this would be comical if not for the noxious cynicism of it all. clinton may not remember if she was ever aware in the first place, but the original version of my president is black is a brazen middle finger to nonblack america. just a few lines after the verse hillary quoted, the song taunts
hello miss america, hey pretty lady
red, white, and blue flag, wave for me baby
never thought id say this s, baby im good
you can keep your p, i dont want no more bush
no more war, no more iraq
no more white lies, the president is black
so the poster granny for liberal white privilege, groveling for black votes, kissed the rings of celebrity obama bffs jay-z and beyonce by parroting an inflammatory anthem laced with profanities and radical racialized gloating.
could there have been a more perfect beclownment to cap clintons phony-baloney stronger together campaign?
after denigrating millions of trump supporters as deplorable and irredeemable earlier this year, clinton then unctuously confessed on election eve i regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became.
note the classic textbook employment of the passive voice to evade personal responsibility.
the good news is that after being blasted as haters by clintons hate-filled minions, after being slapped down as racial cowards by clintonite holdover eric holder, after being lambasted as xenophobes and nativists by immigration expansionists in both parties, after enduring a string of faked hate crimes blamed on conservatives, after ceaseless accusations of islamophobia in the wake of jihad attacks on american soil, after baseless accusations of homophobia for protesting the governments gay wedding cake coercion, and after mourning a growing list of police officers ambushed and targeted by violent thugs seeking racial vengeance, an undeniable movement of citizens in the 2016 election cycle decided to push back.
when all is said and done, one of the most important cultural accomplishments of donald trumps bid will be the platform he created for americans of all colors, ethnicities, political affiliations, and socioeconomic backgrounds to defy soul-draining identity politics.
beltway chin-pullers expediently focused on trumps white and conservative supporters who are rightly sick and tired of social justice double standards. but they ignored the increasingly vocal constituency of hyphen-free, label-rejecting american people against political correctness who dont fit old narratives and boxes.
and the same never trump pundits and establishment political strategists who gabbed endlessly about the need for minority outreach after 2012 were flummoxed by the blacks, gays, latinos, women and democrats who rallied behind the gop candidate.
the most important speech of the 2016 election cycle wasnt delivered by one of the presidential candidates. it came from iconoclastic silicon valley entrepreneurinvestor and trump supporter peter thiel who best explained the historically significant backlash against the intolerant tolerance mob and phony diversity-mongers.
louder voices have sent a message that they do not intend to tolerate the views of one half of the country, he observed at the national press club last week. he recounted how the gay magazine the advocate, which had once praised him as a gay innovator, declared he was not a gay man anymore because of his libertarian, limited-government politics.
the lie behind the buzzword of diversity could not be made more clear, thiel noted. if you dont conform, then you dont count as diverse, no matter what your personal background.
trumps eclectic coalition was bound by that common thread disaffected individuals tired of being told they dont count and discounted because their views do not properly match their gender, chromosomes, skin color or ethnicity. that is exactly why the more they and their nominee were demonized, the stronger their support grew.
no matter what happens in this election, thiel concluded last week, what trump represents isnt crazy and its not going away. 
hes right. i too often take for granted my own personal awakening about the entrenched tribalism of identity politics at a crazy liberal arts college in the early 1990s. the liberation from collectivist ideology is profound and lasting. witnessing so many outspoken newcomers arrive at this enlightenment, however circuitous the route, has been the most encouraging and underappreciated phenomenon of the 2016 campaign.

"nato calls for more troops for face-off against putin wars and rumors of wars nato calls for more troops for face-off against putin largest military build-up on russia's borders since cold war published 11 mins ago 
haaretz nato will press allies on wednesday to contribute to its biggest military build-up on russias borders since the cold war as the alliance prepares for a protracted quarrel with moscow. 
with russias aircraft carrier heading to syria in a show of force along europes shores, alliance defense ministers aim to make good on a july promise by nato leaders to send forces to the baltic states and eastern poland from early next year. 
the united states hopes for binding commitments from europe to fill four battle groups of some 4,000 troops, part of natos response to russias 2014 annexation of crimea and concern it could try a similar tactic in europes ex-soviet states.",238,736264,real

one of the sure signs that a voters are close to a definitive outcome in a presidential election is when some in the media start trying to gin up a comeback for the trailing candidate. with the exception of fox news and other conservative outlets, media like cnn go down this path because they see interest waning in the election, so they are looking to boost ratings with some artificial drama.

by stephen lendman 
the bill and hillary crime family long ago should have been held accountable for high crimes against peace and numerous others. hillary is the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in us history, supporting endless imperial wars and state terror, once saying what do we have nato for if not to defend our way of life. there was never a war hillary did not support  crimes against humanity she endorses first-strike nuclear weapons use, calling them peacekeeping deterrents, mindless of their power to destroy life on earth. shes militantly anti-russia, earlier compared the nation to nazi germany, putin to hitler, claiming he doesnt have a soul, has revanchist aims, wanting russian greatness restored  all of the above a perversion of truth, not to mention a pretext to wage war on russia. the so-called clinton foundation is a suspected criminal enterprise, masquerading as a charitable ngo. it promotes big lies about improving global health, increasing opportunity for women and girls, reducing childhood obesity and preventable diseases, as well as creating economic opportunity and growth film producer frank huguenard believes hillary clinton faces impending federal racketeering charges under the 1970 racketeering influence and corrupt organizations act rico. enacted to fight organized and white collar crime, racketeering is defined to include fraud, bribery, money laundering, embezzlement, drugs trafficking, murder, and various other offenses under the federal criminal code title 18, even acts of terrorism. according to huguenard, obama-appointed fbi chief james comey will recommend attorney general loretta lynch treat the clinton foundation as an ongoing criminal enterprise engaged in money laundering and soliciting bribes in exchange for political, policy and legislative favors to individuals, corporations and even governments both foreign and domestic. morning joe destroys corrupt clinton foundation  total corruption strong stuff if only partly true! huguenard cites credible evidence, indicating the clinton foundation is largely a money laundering, influence peddling racket. less than 10 of tens of millions of dollars donated went for charitable purposes, the rest for self-enrichment. there is ample evidence already in the public record that the clinton foundation qualifies as a criminal enterprise and theres no doubt that the fbi is privy to significantly more evidence than has already been made public, said huguenard. if comey recommends attorney general lynch indict hillary clinton, its unlikely shell prosecute a woman shes had close ties to for years. bill clinton appointed her us attorney for the eastern district of new york  serving from 1999  2001. from 2003  2005, she was a wall street controlled new york federal reserve bank of new york board member  the mother bank most complicit with its member bank crooks. from 2002  2010, she was a washington-headquartered hogan  hartson h  h law firm partner. its new york-based partner howard topaz filed income tax returns for bill and hillary clinton, beginning in 2004. in may 2004, h  h filed patent trademark documents for denver-based mx logic inc., the computer software firm responsible for developing email encryption technology used to manage hillarys private email server, beginning in july 2013. judicial watch president tom fitton according to judicial watch president tom fitton, if h  h now hogan lovells following a 2010 merger represented the clintons on tax matters, lynch is responsible for disclosing any involvement she may have had, direct or indirect. in april 2008 during hillarys first presidential campaign, the american lawyer called h  h one of her largest legal industry supporters. loretta elizabeth lynch, attorney general of the united states. partner christine varney was chief counsel to the clintongore 1992 campaign. the ties between h  h, lynch and the clintons are longstanding. in november 2014, obama announced her appointment as attorney general, succeeding eric holder, effective april 27, 2015 after senate confirmation. its hard imagining her biting a hand contributing greatly to her career advancement. key for clinton is how much more of her dark side becomes public knowledge besides whats already known. if enough despite lynch declining to indict and supportive media scoundrels downplaying or whitewashing her offenses, the democratic sic national committee dnc might be forced to jettison her as damaged goods. shed be red meat for trump to take full advantage of in the fall campaign. would bernie sanders party bosses dont want become democrat standard bearer in july? or will joe biden or another high-profile party member perhaps be chosen as a late-stage establishment nominee, a brokered convention manipulating things? americas political system is too debauched to fix. duopoly power eliminates governance of, by and for everyone equitably. republicans and democrats are two sides of the same coin  special interests served exclusively, ordinary people betrayed, the same outcome every electoral cycle. whoever succeeds obama, likely worse than ever governance will follow. the greatest concern is preventing possible ww iii. clintons rage for endless wars, along with her sinorussian hostility makes the unthinkable possible. stephen lendman lives in chicago. he can be reached at . his new book as editor and contributor is titled flashpoint in ukraine us drive for hegemony risks ww iii.  . visit his blog site at sjlendman.blogspot.com.

"michael oliver  here is the big picture for gold after the takedown 11 views november 13, 2016 gold , kwn king world news 
on the heels of a remarkable week where the world witnessed the greatest political upset in history and subsequent chaos in global markets, today king world news is pleased to present an extremely important update on the war in the gold market from michael oliver at msa. oliver allowed kwn exclusively to share this key report with our global audience after last weeks takedown in the gold market. 
by michael oliver, msa momentum structural analysis november 13  king world new s  gold if one seeks to capture large trends, then measure large if one does not have a long-term map to watch as the trend unfolds, then its all too easy to run when some bullets fly. and they always fly continue reading the michael oliver piece below advertisement to hear which company investors  institutions around the globe are flocking to that has one of the best gold  silver purchase  storage platforms in the world click on the logo 
how we got to where we are today msa projected a blow-off type move in gold, commencing in september 2009, based on price and momentum concurrence and especially its relative performance breakouts vs. global stocks, report was entitled gold is speaking! momentum then broke out over a three point downtrend, noted by the first red line. 
during that rise a very large price selloff occurred in early 2010 that no doubt shook teeth and generated widespread doubt. big as the drop was, it did not negate any long-term structural factors on momentum. nothing reversed that bull view on our part until momentum broke down in early 2012 second red structure was violated  a line defined by many points along the line at around price of 1700 see middle of second chart above. 
then after the top in 20112012 and after momentum had already begun to cave, there came a hair curling rally in late summer 2012. but for annual momentum it was a laughable and uneventful rally. it did not alter the major downside that had already been signaled by momentum early that year. therefore msa was not impressed. many no doubt went long thinking the gold bull was on again. not! 
the gold bull market breakout then with momentum basing action that was optimally clear and massive, golds momentum broke out upside as price moved up into the mid-1100s in february 2016. the massive flat red line on momentum was blasted through see breakout on far right hand side of chart two above. 
msa remains resolutely bullish and asserts that a long-term annual momentum uptrend is underway . exit if you must, based on your own level of risk tolerance each investor and asset manager is different, after all, or if your time scale of participation is short-term. 
msa defines trends, often intermediate and short-term ones in many markets, but in the case of gold we argue that a long-term vista must dominate at this point in time, due to massive shifts underway in other asset categories. implications of those shifts going forward are quite large, such that gold is likely to be at the forefront of world attention in the coming few years . 
the dream of investors but remember that the long-held dream of investors to capture and profit from large trends like the three massive but simple trends shown on the prior page can never be accomplished if one allows short-term or even intermediate-term trend indicators to have more gravitas than the ongoing long-term trend factors . in some markets thats a reasonable approach, but at this point in time, with the annual trend dynamics underway, we caution about trading gold . 
this annual bull signal is simply too young, has not reached any levels of upside excess, and the downturn on long-term momentum charts in the current selloff is not negating that which was screamed by golds annual momentum breakout in february. kwn has just released one of art cashins greatest audio interviews ever discussing the gold market at length, including the recent takedown in gold, what to surprises to expect in key markets as trump becomes president, and what impact massive public works projects will have on the united states, inflation, gold, bonds, and much more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview by clicking here or on the image below.

"comment on leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police by fungirl91 home  badge abuse  leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police matt agorist august 31, 2016 97 comments 
memos and documents published by dcleaks continue shedding light on billionaire globalist george soros and his progressive organization, open society foundations osf. due to their poor digital curation, however, the leaks are hard to comb through which is leading to the information slowly trickling out. the latest of the documents reveals the billionaires attempt to organize a national movement to create a federalized police force. 
the document shows that osf saw the killings of mike brown, eric garner, walter scott, and freddie gray as an opportunity to implement this mission of federal police guidelines. osf, according to the documents, then held a meeting titled, police reform how to take advantage of the crisis of the moment and drive long-term institutional change in police-community practice. 
the memo further documents that soros-financed groups and personalities influenced a task force on 21st century policing, created by president obama. last may, the task force released a final report consisting of 60 recommendations recommending protocol to local departments on how to modify policing practices. 
the information is from a 61-page report of an open society u.s. programs board meeting that took place in new york city in may of last year. 
states the board meeting document 
the federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives. in addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the presidential taskforce, the white house recently launched the policing data initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust, voice, and solutions to improve community policing. the department of justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the national initiative for building community trust and justice, which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice, reduce implicit bias, and support racial reconciliation. 
we are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best usp can use this moment to create a national movement. we have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform, including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work, and opportunities for collaboration. as we proceed, we will engage the funder network we helped to establish, the executive alliance on men and boys of color, which now includes forty foundations. 
u.s. programs usp is a part of osf with the stated mission of working to further a vibrant democratic society in which all people can meaningfully participate in its civic, economic, and political life. 
according to the above excerpt, usp was thinking of ways to capitalize on police killings to create a national movement to implement their agenda. 
the think tank also raises the question of how to properly steer the ostensible grassroots organizations, such as black lives matter, to achieve usp goals. 
the events of the past several months have understandably led to a wide range of activities, including a variety of advocacy efforts, to respond to the significant challenges in policing that have been exposed and the opportunity to promote meaningful and lasting change. for example, organized under the banner of the civil rights coalition on police reform, organizations like the lawyers committee for civil rights under the law, lcchr, and ldf are advocating for federal reform efforts with a particular emphasis on data collection and transparency and, as noted above, 35 effecting federal funding streams. a variety of other national advocacy organizations, including grantees advancement project, policylink, the center for popular democracy and the aclu are working to provide advocates with toolkits and resources to help their organizing efforts. locally based groups such as the ohio student association, the organization for black struggle, the asian law caucus, and the aclu of new jersey, to name a few, are advocating for specific reforms at the city and state levels. another layer of grassroots and youth-oriented groups like freedom side, ferguson action, black lives matter and million hoodies movement for justice are also advocating for specific reforms. the range of efforts underway raises a number of questions and concerns about capacity, the need for coordination and the appropriate prioritization of policy objectives, among others, which we will discuss in the policing portion of the meeting. 
while the intentions of reforming police in america seem noble, the very idea of a soros-led initiative is chilling. 
another memo, leaked earlier this month, showed the billionaire was potentially funding the black lives matter movement , to the tune of 650,000. now, as todays memo shows, we know why. 
as the free thought project has pointed out many times before, soros has been exposed literally manipulating the world. 
earlier this month, in an email found within the wikileaks hillary clinton archive, with the subject unrest in albania, soros makes clear to clinton that two things need to be done urgently. he then directs the secretary of state to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on prime minister berisha and appoint a senior european official as mediator. revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power, soros then provides secretary of state clinton with three names from which to choose. unsurprisingly, clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by soros  miroslav lajcak. 
this is standard operating procedure for soros. anyone familiar with the history of the soros open society foundations in eastern europe and around the world since the late 1980s, will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracy-building projects in poland, russia, or ukraine in the 1990s allowed soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth, according to the new eastern outlook . 
soros-affiliated organizations are deeply connected to numerous color revolutions, such as the arab spring, and a number of other uprisings across the world. they have been intimately involved in the coup that took place in ukraine, and subsequent ratcheting up of cold war tensions with russia. 
as these leaked memos and emails prove, the united states is nothing more than one of soros pawns. 
while americans remain oblivious and argue over straw men fed to them by the mainstream media, the police state is growing  both here and abroad. as the citizens are promised reform the only thing that actually changes are the puppets in marble buildings. matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa. this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state. agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world. follow mattagorist on twitter and now on a href share google  real truth stings 
i think its time to end local policing for profit. the police force should exist to protect and serve, not to fill the county coffers. we need direct oversight of the police, the end of the power of their union to protect bad cops and the end of corrupt local government. the downside is the federal government is so big and spread out that they can barely keep track of our military assets. we can count on them to institute a public facing, qualifications search for candidates. randy pitts 
do you really not understand that what you just said is exactly what this article is exposing?!?!?! 
soros has indoctrinated you fools into favoring a federal police!!! real truth stings 
do you have a better idea? we have localized corruption in every state. if you have another way to achieve this, feel free to discuss it. billdeserthills 
right, mostly because obama has been doing everything he can to crap on the police. by your thinking the tsa is doing a fantastic job, huh? real truth stings 
you arent looking at the upsides that are possible. billdeserthills

i dont like police misconduct. but i dont burn down the city yelling kill the jews to accomplish it. tracy lund 
what a stupid thing to say. razedbywolvs 
does that make you pro burring down the city to stop the 1 who all happen to be ashkenazi jews? az patriot 
what are you talking about ? what do jews have to do with this ? you and some other people are on this are now blaming the jews for the mess we are in. how stupid razedbywolvs 
well that kind of happens when you use a lobbys to buy off every politician in a foreign country, and are a big contributing factor to what appears to be a 3000 year old blood feud in the me.  az patriot 
typical jew hater there really is no hope for you or your soul . why not worry about the people who are willing to blow you up ? razedbywolvs

dont leave out his son. greg geitner 
now its easy to see why soros was paying them to act out ricialove 
as a black woman, heres what i want to knowwith all that money that blm receives.what the heck do they do?!?! anna miller 
george soros is a criminal subversive who has created havoc on a global level and for a long time. his crimes are well-documented. he is the billonaire who broke the british pound in 1992. he is responsible for funding numerous revolutions including the coup in ukraine, toppling a democratically elected president and moving nato closer to russian borders. and funding ngos who were not really charities, but subversive infiltrators. he is an evil man. have you noticed how many billonaire jews are involved in all kinds of evil financial schemes, and or hold such high positions in both neoliberal as well as neocon both sides of the fencegovernment positions although they only make up 2 of the populace? why hasnt this criminal been arrested? his aim is to deliberately stir up a race war. the police are attacking people of all colors and ages. yet blm seems to defend black men who were in truth, guilty. at least they could pick a black man or woman who was actually innocent. why doesnt black lives matter defend blacks who have been murdered by other blacks, which is usually the case. or dont those black lives matter? and how about the 72 of black children born to single mothers, with no father in the home? often to siblings from multiple fathers. these children often grow up to be street thugs. the facts bear this out. blacks do commit most of the crime in the u.s, and commit more crimes against whites as well. the issue should be on the increasing police brutality on all citizens, not only focused on black lives. the police target them more because blacks commit most of the crime. does the truth enter this equation? blm detracts from the entire populace of all races focusing together, on increased police brutality against the public at large. for soros, and those who want to increase anti-white sentiment and race tensions, blm is mission accomplished. the bastard soros should have been arrested a long time ago, and imprisoned, and not in one of those cushy hotel prisons either. and one can only wonder who is really running this nation, when soros remains unfettered. dan 
maybe, just maybe hitler saw something that the rest of the world still can not see. or simply refuses to see az patriot 
what are you saying, all jews should have been sent to the gas chamber so that soros wouldnt be around ? dan 
oh right, your one of those kinds of people huh.. next you are going to tell me that they really did make lampshades and soap out of jews huh? az patriot 
if i were you, i wouldnt continue to show your ignorance, insensitivity and anti jew sentiment. go away dan 
im ignorant? bwahahah. heres an easy one for ya, whats 6 minus 3 ? carolyn 
idiot must run in your family carolyn 
dan, you are an atheist who wants the world to believe that hitler did not slaughter millions of jews. go to the holocaust museums filled with the pictures and tools the nazis used to experiment on the children pictures taken by the american soldiers when they entered into the prisons. so go into a hellnory site and w her with your crap. dan 
so, explain to me how they had to change the plaque at auschwitz in the 90s from claiming 4 million died there to only just over 1 million? and its now believed that its not even 1 million that died there? 
and you dare to call me the idiot? keep googling, im sure you can find it carolyn 
i did not call you an idiot but i should have. auschwitz was only one of many concentration and death camps. you check it out. dan 
wow, you have shown your level of stupid on 2 levels in the one post, good work.. but i digress, ad hominems like yours only exist to show your own lack of a reasonable argument 
auschwitz was well known to have been by far the largest concentration camp during ww2 with the greatest population compared to all other camps, it even boasted a swimming pool inside the camp for its population. how do they just lose 3 million deaths from that camp? if auschwitz could not accomodate 4 million deaths but only closer to 1 million how did the other much smaller camps process more deaths than alschwitz? 
now, here is hte real kicker, from back in 1901 jews were already claiming the 6 million 4 decades into the future its in the damn newspapers and you can freely search and find them for yourself 
care to explain how that happened? jew magic i guess?  carolyn 
dan did you read any of the small incomplete articles? evidently not. 6m was quoted to show that russia and other countries had that many jews. nothing about death. these prior years to 1938 were expressing the plight of how the jewish people were being treated. now auschwitz was not the only camp that slaughtered jews. now does that sign specifically say that auschwitz deaths were just auschwitz murders? your damn newspapers need to be read by you before you put that smudge attitude in writing. dan 
wow, your brain really is broken huh? you cant see the connection between claiming the magical 6 million prophecy which is actually about claiming the heartland in 1900 and using that same exact figure in the lies about ww2? the same lies that the nazis also made lampshades and soap out of jews? 
auschwitz plaque was obviously blatantly lying just like the lampshades and soap myths, once the soviets were forced to give up the ledgers iirc in the 80s it was obvious that they could no longer sustain the lie that 4 million were killed there and were forced to bring that number down to about 1.5 million. are you really that stupid that you can not see the pattern here? 
there is a hell of a lot more but i get the feeling that im talking to someone to stupid to even grasp the basics. 
fun fact anne frank never wrote anne franks diary, otto bought the story from another novelist and changed it to reflect his daughter. there was even a recent copyright case where they are now claiming that he was the author. fun times. carolyn 
oh i see your pattern. believe that crap instead of what the pictures, written accounts by the liberation armies, and you did not answer my question on the articles you want to point to that does not say 6m jews died. did you pull all of the articles and read the whole story? i would bet you did not. you are a typical atheist, marxist, democrat. you can pound your chest again when you check history and find out that the democraps started the kkk group and were the biggest slave owners. you people amaze me how you put crap out there that you can not back up. kind of like your loving candidate hellnory. dan 
show me a single picture of gassed jews? or even of the gas chambers themselves? or even the several thousand dead jews they would have to have piled up waiting for their several hours in the crematorium it actually took back then to cremate even a single body? or you mean i am meant to take the word of the proven lying jews who to this day, like in the video i linked above, have clung to their fantasies even after they have been busted lying? 
as for the liberating armies, you do recall that all the gas chambers were in ruins when they came through? and there was zero evidence, besides the lamp shades and soap, of any jew holocaust? that account you mean? 
and of course it dosnt say that 6 million died yet, only that they were in peril etc but you dont find it a mighty large coincidence? you also obviously have no idea how they came up with the 6 million at the end of ww2 do you? go find out where that number came from.. the person who made it up even claimed it was completely symbolic and not to be taken literally. 
you are a typical atheist, marxist, democrat. and in the face of clear defeat, out with the mindless ad hominem once again. a clear indicator that you are way outside of your depth you are incorrect on all 3 counts, once again. do you ever get anything right? 
were the biggest slave owners. guess who the biggest slave owners were? fucking jews!!! hahaha. they owned all the slave ships and were behind every facet of the trade. 
kind of like your loving candidate hellnory. and thats the funniest, go find my twitter feed, its full of anti hillary sentiment, in fact its the only reason i really began using twitter was during this election cycle to keep track of whats going on because i refuse to engage in the corrupt leftist media once again, mostly jew owned for fear of turning into a brainless zombie like yourself 
ill give you this tho, you certainly are persistent in your stupidity. its no wonder you cant see anything thats going on around you in this world. dan 
here is a great classic you really should watch about his explaining away his lies as not really lies  carolyn 
you really have a real talent referencing things. dan 
yea, this is how you learn things. you take a fairytale, lets use santa as an example, and you work out when your like 6 years old how can there be 12 santas in the same place? why are my presents always in the bottom of my parents wardrobe a week before santa apparently brings them to you a week later? and slowly you deduce that there is no santa clause and its just a lie that you have been fed while your brain is all still mushy. 
or you know, you can just blindly have faith that there is still a santa, you know, like you do even in the face of such a mountain of evidence carolyn 
you need to stop your atheistic info because you do not know what you are talking about. 1.1m jews killed in all of the auschwitz camps. did you know that there were 3 large camps with 4 large crematoriums? no you did not. that is just a drop in the bucket places that murdered, experimented on, starved, gased, and shooting of jews. 426k hungary, 300k poland, 69k france, 60k netherlands, 55k greece, 46k boheman  moravia, 27k slovakia, 25k belgium, 10k yugoslavia, 8k itally, 690 norway, and 34k from other countries. 960k jews, 74k poles, 21k gypsies, 15k soviet prisoners, 15k czecks, yugoslavs, french, germans. did you know that hitler had built 40,000 camps. death camps, concentration camps, holding camps, gas camp vans, labor camps and detention camps. many jews died in ghettos, on trains, during the death march to evade the oncoming of the russian army and us forces. these camps were set up in france, russia, germany, poland, and austria. one of the camps, berkenau, killed 6 thousand jews per day. in total 2.7m jews killed in killing centers and 3.3 jews shot, gased, experimented on. now how do you explain your decision to not believe these totals? dan 
of course i knew, i obviously know more about the subject than you do. like you i came from a place of believing the lies until i started questioning some of the facts i was taught and the advent of the internet and survivors videos where they constantly get busted telling lies made me reconsider the truth about ww2 
actually current scholars beleive its somewhere between 300k and i think its 700k it might be 800k died in all of auschwitz. while i do not doubt that there was some experimenting america was doing the same thing but on its own people at the time the great majority were simply natural attrition in a time of war considering the allies were bombing supply lines constantly yet never the camps themselves because they also knew they were not death camps in fact lets invoke the story of the holocaust poster child again anne frank, if they were really gassing people in some huge manner why would they even keep around a weak sickly girl long enough for her to die from typhus? 
and yes of course many people died, many of them jews. thats what happens when you have wars. none of this supports gassing or mass extermination of jews, stupid. 
but my final question is, how do you blindly believe the word of people who have been shown on many occasions to be liars? specially in the face of so much verifiable evidence to the contrary ie the lampshades, soap, diesel gassing vans, eye witness stories that completely contradict everything etc specially knowing the fact that many jews chose to escape with their german captors rather than await the soviet armys rescue? carolyn 
of course you did not know any of the information i wrote. if you profess that you know how many died, then go on the holocaust site and you will see that after they checked the records that the germans kept, you do know they tattooed the jews, to make sure what numbers were dead or alive. how would i know why they kept anne franks till she died of typhus. they very cruel people. the jews were at war with the nazi germans. what the hell are you talking about. if you go on the site you will see pictures of the gas chambers and crematories. what the hell else do you want. why dont you go to auschwitz and see for yourself? you are so bigoted and i believe you are a lousy democrap. despicable rem1875 certified

"stop watching rt and other russian-biased sources. a tale of two cities november 1, 2016 -  
by tom winter exclusively for fort russ -  

screen capture from in the now video a tale of two cities it was the best of times, it was the worst of times the best of times  thats mosul. the liberation of the city from isis is going apace, with the us air force assisting iraq. yes, the resistance is fierce, and there will be door-to-door fighting, but the day of deliverance is coming -- a summary of npr this morning. 
no war crimes, not even any mention of civilian casualties under the euphemism of collateral damage."" and mosul is never called ""a city under siege""! 
the worst of times  thats aleppo, ""a city under siege."" this is where dictator assad and the russians are deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure under the condemnation of the western world for war crimes and crimes against humanity. thus speak the parrots, with one voice, following mark c. toner's press briefings. and npr is there to remind us that kerry wants russian war crimes investigated ' russia's bombing of civilians in syria ""beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes.""'  and to remind us that russia is bombing hospitals . 
never a mention of the besieged being isis!  
listening to cnn and npr national pr, no one would ever guess that its the same struggle in each city, a struggle to liberate innocent civilians from the headchoppers of isis. but in mosul, npr acknowledges that the innocent civilians are forced to stay and serve as human shields for isis. 
your retired latin prof translatorcommentator keeps up with the help of facebook friends in 35 countries. comparing the international posts and comments with the american ones points out the irony. one of them, in romania, has been advised to stop watching rt and other russian-biased sources.  
but in romania, there is no access to fox, cnn, or even to npr. so what is the poor rumanian to do?  and in another bingo for godwins law, the one advising against trusting rt calls trump another hitler. 
in the following response to a report of 300 civilians killed in a us airstrike,  
there is a mix of the rational, yet it is still written through the lens of cnn and the rest of western msm i am a little defensive that some of these stories have come from rt not this one when russia is deliberately targeting civilians and basically you could argue we need to try harder to avoid them.  it is an area with a high damned if you do potentially causing collateral deaths and damned if you don't thus allowing isis to spread and kill civilians directly quotient.  to which the only possible reply  
look at what you wrote! our airstrikes cause ""collateral damage;"" russian airstrikes ""deliberately target civilians."" the collusion of the western press with the washington blob took a month or two to take hold there was a time, early in 2014, when talking heads were saying stuff like ukraine should just make the best deal they can with russia. one retired french politician noted there is no sense getting involved in matters of what used to be internal boundaries of the soviet union. cnn as late as september of 2014 once acknowledged that the kiev government was bombing civilians .   

but not any more! all the non-russia-biased media have long since gotten the memo. 

and to avoid intellectual discomfort from exposure to views and news that do not jibe with the us state department and cnn, don't watch rt or any russia-biased sources!

"woman facing jail for giving water to thirsty pigs contact us woman facing jail for giving water to thirsty pigs pigs have been known to courageously jump into water to rescue drowning children., but this woman is facing jail for giving water to pigs that were in ""sever distress""   , world  0 comments 
giving water to thirsty pigs on a hot day can now lead to jail time, as has been proven by a toronto woman who is on trial and facing sentencing for doing just that. 
anita kranjc tells her story  
on a scorching hot day in june 2015, i gave water to thirsty pigs on board a transport truck headed for the slaughterhouse. as the now famous video of the incident shows, the driver jumped out of the cab, telling me to stop. i replied with a reference to the bible jesus said, if they are thirsty, give them water. 
the driver shouted back, these are not humans, you dumb frickin broad! 
he called the police, and now im on trial in a canadian court for criminal mischief. 
when someone is suffering, i believe it is wrong to look the other away. it doesnt matter if the sufferer has two legs or four or asks for help in words we can understand or with body language that is just as easy to comprehend. leo tolstoy, an ethical vegetarian and one of my inspirations, wrote, we should take pity on animals in the same way as we do on each other. and we all know this, if we do not deaden the voice of our conscience inside us. 
the pigs i was trying to help on that fateful day were undoubtedly suffering. crammed into a transport truck on a sweltering day, these helpless animals  covered with their own excrement, being crushed together and slowly suffocating from heat  stared at me through the trailers metal slats with their pleading eyes. as dr armaiti may, a veterinary expert, testified during my trial, some of the pigs were foaming at the mouth and in severe distress, appearing to breathe as quickly as 180 breaths per minute. 
i think we have not only a right but also a duty to help suffering animals. toronto pig save , the group that i helped start with my dog mr bean in 2010, has continued to give water to thirsty pigs to this day. our approach is to collectively bear witness to ill-fated animals at the end of their miserable lives and hold weekly vigils outside slaughterhouses. 
a slaughterhouse might seem like the last place that animal lovers would want to be, but for us  as for the quakers, greenpeace and similar groups  bearing witness is about being present at sites of great injustice. our personal contact puts a face on the nameless numbers, to borrow from charles dickens, and helps people see animal victims as unique individuals who want to live. 
theres little doubt in my mind that if those were dogs in distress in that truck instead of pigs, my actions would be applauded and it would be the driver facing charges instead. this double standard should have everyone questioning the ethics of the meat, dairy and egg industry, our legal system and our food choices. like dogs, pigs are friendly, loyal and sensitive animals who have a strong sense of self and intelligence. they are playful and affectionate they love to snuggle. they feel love and joy, but also pain and fear. they possess protective feelings for their families and friends. pigs have been known to courageously jump into water to rescue drowning children. 
in esther the wonder pig, a new york times bestseller , esthers human dads attest to the porcine internet stars big personality, her keen intelligence and her sense of humor. our laws need to be changed to reflect this all animals should be treated as thinking, feeling individuals under the law, because that is what they are. they are not property, nor cogs in the machine, with numbered tags slapped on their ears. 
humans need to recognize that we are also animals and that we are all interconnected. we are like animals in all the ways that matter  we feel pain, we suffer, we grieve, we are afraid of being killed and we get thirsty on a hot day. by showing people this, we hope we will reach their hearts so they will feel what animals feel. then finally we will be able to end the horrific suffering at farms and slaughterhouses and shift towards a nonviolent plant-based economy. 
we are all in this together, humans and pigs. i am, quite literally, because i am facing jail time for giving pigs some small comfort in their final moments. my trial resumes 1 november. the cruelty inflicted on pigs at animal farms and slaughterhouses touches all of us, by harming animals, by polluting the environment, by harming our health and our conscience when we consume the products of this suffering. by bearing witness to animals in distress, we discover the unity of life.",242,736265,fake

"bellwether? trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes bellwether? trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes company sees preference as 'early exit poll of orthodox jews' published 24 mins ago print 
washington  the campaigns of donald trump and hillary clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the white house in january. 
a company that makes trump and hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the orthodox jewish clientele. 
so far, the company, pic-a-kippa, has sold 331 trump yarmulkes to 65 for clinton. 
my kippa yarmulke company sells trump and hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more, uri turk, founder and chief kippa officer, told wnd. we see it as an early exit poll of the orthodox jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the trump kippas. 
pic-a-kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret idf soldiers from miami. turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling trump and hillary custom kippas on its site since august, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
our mission is to help jews everywhere show and wear their jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas, the company says on its website. 
it donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the lone soldier center in israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
turk said while american jews have leaned heavily democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen orthodox jews, who make up over 10 percent of american jewry, vote republican in ever increasing numbers. he attributes that fact to the democrats putting daylight between america and israel. 
a number of influential jewish pro-trump organizations have emerged, chief among them jews choose trump and jewish democrats for trump. a recent poll of florida jews showed orthodox voters are leaning toward trump by a 3-1 margin. 
according to turk, pic-a-kippa has sold many trump kippas to a congregant of ivanka trumps synagogue on the liberal upper east side of manhattan and has gotten orders for trump kippas from israel, australia, britain and even mexico. pic-a-kippa has also gotten hate mail from jews unhappy they are selling the trump designs, he says.",238,736264,real

new video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, fred trump, young donald trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
as part of an investigation by nbc news, stanley leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the trump organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
in the interview, leibowitz said that trump told him i dont rent to the n-word, and indicates that trump made this statement with donald trump in the room and that the younger trump affirmed the policy. 
the revelation comes at the same time that the clinton campaign has released a video highlighting trumps run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
undercover investigators were sent to trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. the white applicants were allowed into the trump properties. 
one bit of testimony determined that trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a c on the documents for colored, and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
the trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
donald trumps involvement with his fathers business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his fathers 14 million dollars that he gave to trump to start his business. but if you accept that, the trump organizations history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how trump may try to wave it away  its still there.

by dan elliott 
the department of veterans affairs has warned more than 2,100 veterans in eastern colorado and parts of kansas that their personal information may have been compromised when an employee emailed documents to himself. 
an agency employee told the associated press that he is the person who emailed the information to himself, describing it as unauthorized wait lists used by va health care facilities in colorado. the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he fears retaliation, said he wanted to document the lists because they could have been used to conceal lengthy delays in providing care. 
in wednesdays warning to veterans, the va said the potentially compromised information included veterans full names, the last four digits of their social security numbers and medical diagnoses. the agency said the employee emailed it to himself in unencrypted form.

"limbaugh democrats would 'destroy jesus christ' actor jim caviezel portraying jesus in the passion of the christ. 
jesus christ of nazareth is not the republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
but if he were, democrats would try to destroy him in the same manner theyre attacking the 2016 gop candidate, donald trump. 
thats according to radio host rush limbaugh, who hypothesized what this years race would look like if the son of god were at the top of the republican ticket. 
should president trump try to prosecute hillary? sign the hottest petition in america now to show your support! 
it doesnt matter who the republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment trumps getting. it wouldnt have mattered, limbaugh said wednesday. 
they would go out of their way to find ways to destroy jesus christ if he could be nominated as a republican. the democrats would do everything they could, include calling him a liar, the bible a fake book, whatever it took. rush limbaugh 
and despite the fact the bible never indicates jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, limbaugh suggested democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of his offspring 
they would scour the historical record looking for children he had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit jesus. thats who they are. thats what they would do. 
limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that republicans would never escape this kind of media assault based on who we nominate. donald trumps rnc acceptance speech photo screenshot from rnc live feed 
i say this because a lot of you never trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like trump. no, its exactly what you get when you nominate a republican. whenever there is any opposition to the democrats, this is what they do. it doesnt matter. theyre gonna do it. they did it to romney  
ive made this point til i blue in the face. they turned romney, who is mild-mannered mr. gosh, cant even get noticed into the biggest walking satan, el diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick so this is why i think trump has so many people supporting him. hes fighting back against it when most republicans havent and dont. 
as an example of how media treatment of republicans has not changed, limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from cbs. commentator bill moyers characterized the race before it was known that republican ronald reagan would easily defeat democrat jimmy carter. moyers stated 
those of you who might speak spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember, said carter, whos been your friend. and there under the california sun in san diego at a shopping center, ronald reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which hes been a master since his days at eureka college. suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their era signs. reagan took his cue and snapped back, aw, shut up! 
and thousands of supporters roared their approval. those are the people for whom ronald reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. jimmy carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, enoughs enough. 
does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world? limbaugh asked. not an iota!

"bellwether? trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes bellwether? trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes company sees preference as 'early exit poll of orthodox jews' published 9 mins ago print 
washington  the campaigns of donald trump and hillary clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the white house in january. 
a company that makes trump and hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the orthodox jewish clientele. 
so far, the company, pic-a-kippa, has sold 331 trump yarmulkes to 65 for clinton. 
my kippa yarmulke company sells trump and hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more, uri turk, founder and chief kippa officer, told wnd. we see it as an early exit poll of the orthodox jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the trump kippas. 
pic-a-kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret idf soldiers from miami. turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling trump and hillary custom kippas on its site since august, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
our mission is to help jews everywhere show and wear their jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas, the company says on its website. 
it donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the lone soldier center in israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
turk said while american jews have leaned heavily democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen orthodox jews, who make up over 10 percent of american jewry, vote republican in ever increasing numbers. he attributes that fact to the democrats putting daylight between america and israel. 
a number of influential jewish pro-trump organizations have emerged, chief among them jews choose trump and jewish democrats for trump. a recent poll of florida jews showed orthodox voters are leaning toward trump by a 3-1 margin. 
according to turk, pic-a-kippa has sold many trump kippas to a congregant of ivanka trumps synagogue on the liberal upper east side of manhattan and has gotten orders for trump kippas from israel, australia, britain and even mexico. pic-a-kippa has also gotten hate mail from jews unhappy they are selling the trump designs, he says.",238,736264,real
