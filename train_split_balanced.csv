whom you resonate at a soul level. when you met these individuals you felt a strong and undeniable connection with them, like if you had met them before from a past life. even if they live on the other side of the world, the spiritual ties between you are so strong that years can go by and when you meet again is like no time has passed. 4. meeting your twin flame or soul mate you are in a relationship with a person that highlights and enhances your best qualities. as well, this person will mirror back to you everything you need to work on yourself. this relationship thrives on

the integrity of your field. 8. holographic nature of reality like rumi said you are not a drop of water in an ocean, you are the entire ocean in a drop of water. the holographic nature of reality is encoded within you and you can sense the interconnectedness of everything. it is obvious to you that we live in a multidimensional matrix and that you have a multidimensional anatomy. you also feel very attracted to sacred geometry. 9. alchemical and healing powers whether its hands on healing, soul retrieval or any other type of healing modality you have learned how to direct your intent and

their healing and ascension process with your siddhis. 10. activating your dna dna activation is the process of accreting more light into your morphogenetic field by activating the dormant strands of dna that correspond to your higher self. you have at least a 12 strand dna template that allows 12 dimensions of consciousness. dna activation is the key to spiritual ascension and the embodiment of your higher self. its quite common for a person who goes through dna activation to progressively experience all the other signs mentioned in this page. 11. unconditional self-love your 4th strand of dna corresponds to your heart chakra. one of the main benefits of dna activation is being able to access and embody a state of unconditional self-love. no longer do you feel the need to extract love from other people, instead you see yourself as an infinite source of love. a sense of wholeness begins to unfold as you love all aspects of yourself, including your shadow self. 12. integrating and transcending your shadow self your shadow self is the part of you that is running in reverse. it is mainly made up of archetypes, personas and complexes. some examples are the professional victim persona, the rescuer archetype, the sorcerer, the tyrant and the absolute perfectionist. the shadow self is what causes self-sabotage and causes you to create chaos in your life. the shadow self is created by making decisions that are not aligned with your higher self and manifest as reverse codes in your dna. 13. frequency resonance as you continue to raise your frequency you notice how some people begin to fall out of your holographic reality . you understand that your frequencies no longer match. the same can happen with your job or even your country of origin. in turn your higher frequency attracts you to a new grid of people, places, times, things and events that are in line with your higher self. 14. honest yes and honest no you are not afraid of saying no to other people when you inner guidance tells you not to do something or go somewhere. you are not afraid of other peoples reactions and you are true to yourself. every time you are congruent with what you want and what you dont want you feel more powerful. as well you embrace the art of an honest yes when the universe delivers what you desire. you dont try to appear humble or spiritual by rejecting what you truly desire in your life. 15. harmonious family relationships if you think you are enlightened, go spend a weekend with your family. ram dass you have realized that enlightenment doesnt happen in a cave. you have cleared the cords of attachments and karmic ties with your family. gone are the days where you kept experiencing the same old family drama. your family members have shifted their approach to connect with you to higher ways and you acceptlove them just how they are. 16. no guilt, no shame shame and guilt are the two lowest frequency energetic blockages in humanity. in order to embody your higher self you have let go of the identification with shame and guilt. you have cleared the guilt and shame you inherited from your parents through the dna and you have released the shame and guilt that has been implanted by society and religions. instead you choose to embrace the states of joy and bliss. you have become immune to guilt manipulating strategies often used by victims. 17. making decision in line with your higher self instead of making decisions based on fear, righteousness, competition or lack you are making decisions in line with your higher self and ultimately with source-will. you are aware of sources intentions the law of one, unconditional love, cooperation, evolution, perpetual motion, cause and effect, non-judgment and free-will. even though we all have free-will and can ultimately go against source-will youre unconditionally loved, youre aware that making such decisions will trigger the law of cause and effect and create a karmic imprint to re-mind you must heal that karmic miasm at some point. 18. inner and outer abundance lack and limitation are a thing of the past. you have embodied a state of absolute inner abundance that is being reflected onto your holographic reality. you no longer seek to extract love, approval and appreciation from other people, you are the source. happiness is within you. as well you have transcended the spiritual bypass that money is evil and you know that money is just energy, made up of consciousness just like everything else. you enjoy financial abundance and use this abundance to create a more harmonious reality for yourself and others. 19. mind unplugged from the matrix one sign that your mind has been unplugged from the matrix is that you can clearly see the hidden agenda of those who desire to control this planet. you no longer resonate with the news and their official story. you inner truth detector can sense when someone is lying and you have become immune to the low frequency strategies and implants that constantly try to tell you you are not enough. mindless consumerism and the herd mentality seem absurd to you. 20. bye-bye idolatry as you awaken to your co-creative powers and god-like nature, you no longer put other people on a pedestal. your inner guru precedes any external guru and you see teachers as a reflection of your own unlimited potential. the forces of your worthiness and deservedness drive you to achieve whatever you set your mind upon. you have become the master of your own reality . 21. overflowing with gratitude gratitude is your attitude. gratitude is your prayer . the sense of lack has become foreign to you, instead you cannot stop counting your blessings. the feeling of gratitude multiplies whatever you have and brings you even more positive experiences. you are even grateful for the challenges and setbacks that are inevitable in life, you cant help to see them as opportunities for growth. and you probably have a gratitude journal. 22. dont take yourself too seriously life is meant to be fun, you know that. being extremely rigid and disciplined suck the fun out of everything. even though you are adamant when it comes to working on yourself and achieving self mastery, you always allow yourself to make mistakes. in fact making mistakes is part of the learning process. you have a great sense of humor and you dont take yourself too seriously. your inner child is thriving and you often feel energized, inspired and overflowing with creativity. gustavo castaner is the founder of ascendedrelationships.com and

"att secret spy program unveiled project hemisphere posted on october 27, 2016 by ryan banister 
project hemisphere, a secretive program developed by att, searches trillions of call records in order to analyze cell phone data, spying on the activity of private individuals in order to identify who they are speaking with and why, as well as gps tracking on the location of each individual connected to the call, and it transmits this information to the department of justice doj. 
in 2013, project hemisphere was shown in a powerpoint presentation produced by the drug enforcement administration. the new york times reported this as a partnership between att and the doj, primarily deployed for drug-enforcement task-forces. all information collected in this program is accessible to the federal agencies authorized by the doj. 
att specifically developed and marketed this product for use by the doj, who would promise hundreds of millions in funds on behalf of taxpayers, using the taxpayers own money to spy on their every move. this is an invasion of privacy without a warrant. this is a federal spy program by proxy, working through corporations. 
att promises law enforcement that it will not disclose project hemispheres involvement in active investigations that are made public. att is is attempting to lower liability for their customer and limit scrutiny to information transmitted to federal agencies through their network. 
while it should not be surprising that your cell phone company is working with bureaucrats to collect incriminating evidence on you, there is a staggering number of people who still carelessly use their cell phone as if the information being transmitted through the device will be kept private. 
news flash! its never been private. they have always wanted to use your information as a product to sell to the highest bidder. your data is their product, and you are paying them to take it from you.

"why 'never trumpers' must reconsider while democrats perpetually circle the wagons, republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad. the same holds true for many evangelicals. democrats and secularists count on it. 
and we never disappoint. 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and, finally, settled as a reluctant trumper. i, like any god-fearing father of daughters was, and remain, appalled by donald trumps sordid past, and his 11-year-old vulgar video in which he objectified women. his words are indefensible, and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day. 
still, i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov. 8 in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote, for better or worse, for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov. mike pence. 
regrettably, with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith. pride is an awful thing. we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew 1016. foolishness called faith is just foolishness. 
even so, there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first, those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again! pablum and deride any person who, while not casting judgment upon others, makes, with all sincerity, what they view as the principled decision. the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard. while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity, i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong. 
and then there are the self-righteous, plank-in-the-eye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltiness,sinned against god and compromised their principles, brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity. 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service. in 2014 the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate, stared into the camera with cold, callous eyes, and then both lied about and defended unequivocally. i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov. 8. 
mrs. clintons beloved late-term abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the left-leaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances, not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother. 
during a partial-birth abortion, the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb, leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal. this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion, rather than committing murder. 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors, piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt. next, he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands, inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains, thereby collapsing her skull. 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage. 
this is homicide, plain and simple. hillary clinton supports it. donald trump opposes it. 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch. in my estimation, mrs. clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity. her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner. 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs. clinton and ensure that she is stopped. she must not be elected president. to not vote  or to vote for a non-starter third party candidate, which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs. clinton, still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court. 
its simple math, and its undeniable. the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs. clinton by voting for mr. trump. this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations. 
with its 1973 roe v. wade decision, the u.s. supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder. since then, the battle lines have been drawn. this is war. pro-choicers are the bad guys and pro-lifers, the good guys. it really is that simple  that black and white. its good versus evil. 
history will reflect as much. 
under a president hillary clinton, millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive. under a president donald trump, these millions might live. and yet, even as hillary sharpens her knives, we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth. 
the devil and democrats oh, how they love derision and division within the body of christ.",238,736263,real

" why would i want to listen to advice from someone like steven schmidt who advised a presidential candidate mccain who was not able to make it? how can he say trumps priorites are off? he has out performed his opponent in the past month in regards to his campaigning for the wh hands down! the only reason so many people are quick to judge trump and call him a failure is because so many criminals  career politicians and their partners in crime have so much to loose. i would imagine that some are even considering leaving the country to avoid prosecution once trump is elected as potus. afterthought.... this pitstop in dc for the opening dedication of this new hotel can actually be seen as part of his campaigning as it shows people that he is able to accomplish what others have failed to do, under budget and ahead of schedule. you never hear about hillary taking tons of time off the campaign trail or her lack of press conferences and interviews with the media or her lack of on the road campaign rallies. trump takes a brief stop in dc and schmidt claims the walls are falling in on trunp... really???",233,736263,real
"youtube bans 'clinton's black son' print side-by-side of bill clinton and danney williams 
new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams, the 30-year-old who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former president bill clinton. 
youtube, citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines, declared the account cannot be restored. 
the youtube decision blocked the nine-minute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams, which had received 1.2 million views since williams posted it last week. produced by filmmaker joel gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity. 
like the reporting you see here? sign up for free news alerts from wnd.com, americas independent news network. 
my youtube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on youtube alone, williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision. youtube cant handle the truth! please share billclintonson. 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page , but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated. sorry about that. 
the video is still running on danney williams-clintons facebook page , as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert. 
attempt to silence danney williams? 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous! there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines, gilbert said. 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension. 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney, to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in 1990, gilbert said. 
danney cannot be silenced any longer, he continued. hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug, but its not going to work this time. his story is out there, and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin. 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president. 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet. 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced. 
clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father, citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time, there was no match, nothing even close. 
but in an interview, bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna, bunton told wnd. 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw, new york. 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr, extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress. 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the new york times, wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back, bunton recalled to wnd. we thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write. 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi. 
twitter rules 
many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including james okeefe and his project veritas, which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct. 13, twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of twitter rules. the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users private information or violating other rules. in a statement, okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public. on monday, okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube, calling the apparent block bizarre. earlier this month, okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the daily caller reported . project veritas posted an undercover video oct. 17 proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube, which google owns, noted silenceisconsent.net . it did, however, trend on twitter, which google does not own. breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention. for some 11 months, the makers of the new movie im not ashamed, about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through youtube. the trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movies entire channel was suspended . 
among the conservatives censored by facebook  conservative activist and trump supporter lauren southern received a 30-day ban from facebook because she complained about a friends account being censored. facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schoolers account for posting a video supporting rudy giulianis comment that obama doesnt love america. the admin of a pro-trump group was banned for saying trump is not anti-muslim, but anti-isis.",238,736264,real
"trump wrecks any hope gop had of taking advantage of clinton email investigation by jason easley on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 216 pm trump being trump, he stepped on stage and immediately wrecked any chance republicans had of taking advantage of the email story. share on twitter print this post 
trump being trump, he stepped on stage and immediately wrecked any chance republicans had of taking advantage of the email story. 
trump went into full hyperbolic overdrive in new hampshire by claiming that the fbis reopening of the investigation was bigger than watergate. 
the republican nominee took back his claim that the system is rigged. 
video following fbi announcement into clinton's emails, trump remarks, ""the system might not be as rigged as i thought.""  
 abc news politics abcpolitics october 28, 2016 
trump said, but, with what ive just announced, previously, it might not be as rigged as i thought. right? the fbi. i think theyre going to right the ship, folks. i think theyre going to right the ship, and theyre going to save their great reputation by doing so. the speculation is that the fbi is likely to review the new emails and stick by their original finding that hillary clinton did nothing wrong. 
trump and the republicans are jumping to some conclusions. they know that clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs. they are assuming that the fbi is going to find evidence that hillary clinton did something wrong, and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting trump elected. 
trump has no political skills, and no idea when to use a gentle touch and stop. the republican nominee destroyed any hope that the gop had of using the reopened email investigation to their advantage by letting his habits of lying and changing positions on a whim take hold. 
the email scandal isnt going to help republicans. it hasnt before, and it wont now, but trumps over the top incompetence has killed any boost that republicans might have gotten from the story.",133,736265,real
"carrot top to give nobel awards at drive thru window friday, 4 november 2016 nobel prize recipients will be able to go to the drive thru window to get their awards. 
after accruing millions of dollars in debt, the nobel prize committee will forgo a lavish award ceremony in favor of a webcast hosted by carrot top from a drive thru coffee kiosk. 
nobel committee head jørgen myklebust is putting his experience in marketing for supermac's to the task with the new drive thru format for this years award ceremony. he explained the decision when he talked to reporter rance penning of the daily maul. 
""this will be the first year in a decade we don't lose money the webcast costs us virtually nothing and carrot top has agreed to mc the award ceremony in exchange for a nobel prize in chemistry. and having carrot top as the host is already giving us a boost with advertisers."" 
myklebust further explained 
""the nominees will be able to stream the webcast while in the parking lot at nk stockholm, and the winners will drive up to the kiosk window to get their awards."" 
when penning asked if the entire nobel operation was moving to the kiosk, myklebust dismissed the question as silly. 
""you know, it's not serious to ask if we are keeping our offices in the kiosk, of course our whole staff will not fit in a kiosk. for those who are curious, we'll continue to maintain our office space in a camping tent outside tom schuyler's house."" 
this reporter visited with carrot top to talk about the new gig. i had a few minutes with him in his las vegas dressing room as his assistants made him up for that nights show. 
""i can't wait to go to sweden,"" said scott thompson carrot top's real name. ""i can go incognito, you know, i don't stand out as a ginger there.""

"the soldier who wouldnt carry a gun, eat meat or work on saturday is one of americas greatest hero girl put aluminum foil after washing her hair and she delighted the best hairdressers of the world ξ november 1, 2016 blog the soldier who wouldnt carry a gun, eat meat or work on saturday is one of americas greatest hero posted by eddie this is desmond doss, the soldier who refused to carry a gun during wwii. he was the first conscientious objector in americas history to receive the medal of honor, the highest award the military gives. to say he wasnt a typical soldier is putting it way too lightly. desmond doss didnt eat meat, wouldnt train on saturdays and adamantly refused to carry a gun. heck, he wouldnt even carry a bayonet. but during one of the worst battles of wwii, doss is credited with saving 75 lives himself. he was a member of the seventh-day adventist church, and he stuck to its principles  even refusing to train on saturday, the sabbath day in his church. he was working in a shipyard in april, 1942 when he was drafted into military service. because of his religion and his dedication to pacifism, doss was registered as a conscientious objector. that meant he wouldnt be forced to carry a gun. doss became a medic for the 77th infantry division, and made up for taking saturdays off by working extra hours through the week. other soldiers found doss a bit hard to understand, and one of his commanding officers even offered to have him discharged for mental health issues. doss refused, on the grounds that being religious didnt make him crazy. he was on the island of okinawa in 1945 with the rest of the 77th on may 5, when the american military began to lose the battle at the top of a 400-foot ridge. the battle was fierce and fast, with at least 75 men falling in the first few minutes. most of the american troops fell back as the japanese soldiers swarmed. one man stayed on the battlefield, refusing to take cover. it was desmond doss, treating the dozens of wounded soldiers who had fallen in the first fierce rush of the days battle. shells fired above his head as he worked on the field treating the fallen men. he lowered the wounded one by one down to the base, 35 feet below the ridge, using ropes and a litter he fashioned, all while wounded soldiers left behind on the field of battle shot at the advancing japanese. this left doss free to do his work. when he was awarded the medal of honor months later for his actions in the battle, doss was credited with saving 75 liveseven though may 5, 1945 was a saturday. doss was badly wounded in the battle. a grenade went off near him, and he was covered with injuries from the shrapnel. even so, when it was finally his turn to be on a litter, doss jumped back off because he saw a soldier who looked to be in worse shape than he was. he was hit by enemy fire shortly after he got off the litter, and used a rifle stock to create an improvised splint for his shattered arm. it was the most doss ever handled a weapon during his service in wwii. he spent the next 5 years in hospitals, having his injuries treated. doss spent the rest of his life working with the church, mainly in programs involving children and teens. he is one of only two conscientious objectors to receive the medal of honor, and his story has recently been immortalized in film.

"conspiracy vs. government is part of an elite wave of propaganda justifying violent repression conspiracy vs. government is part of an elite wave of propaganda justifying violent repression by - october 31, 2016 
the rise of paranoid politics could make america ungovernable  and the fbi is fuelling the fire  nothing can disprove the fears of a paranoiac. indeed, everything confirms them  it takes away politicians incentive to understand one another and get things done. it says that if you scream loud enough, established norms will buckle under the pressure. and while those norms might be annoying and flawed, well all miss them if they go. uk telegraph 
with us belief in conspiracy theory over 50 percent see our previous article here  elites are showing increasing concern that they have lost control of their narrative. 
this article again illustrates elite push back. the article explains that if people grow paranoid about government, then the norms of government will collapse. 
conspiracy theory is called paranoid politics in this article but it amounts to the same thing. 
the article also has parallels to an article we analyzed recently here by cass sunstein. his bloomberg editorial suggested that nothing was more important from a political standpoint than returning civility to congress and politics generally. 
this article runs along the same lines negative perceptions of the us government can make the process of governing dysfunctional 
more 
take the chemtrails conspiracy theory the idea that the white trails left behind in the sky by aeroplanes are sinister chemicals dispersed to sterilise or control voters. 
if a government declares there is no evidence of such chemicals, that itself must be clear evidence that theres something they dont want us to know. but if that government were to open up an investigation, that too would be incontrovertible proof they must have found something. 
lets reverse this reasoning. apparently, one cant question much that government does because skepticism puts government in a no-win situation. 
better to accept official pronouncements, then. the only trouble is that almost anything modern western governments say are lies. 
governments arent even important these days. the world from what we can tell is run by a small banking elite that controls the awesome power of central banks and the money they print. 
the trillions available to this small group has allowed it to change the nature of society around the world. 
the goal is global government and every kind of violence and corruption is employed to achieve it. 
secrecy is still employed by those creating one world. thus the world is bent on the task of creating global governance while never admitting it. 
but in the past several decades, the internet has credibly exposed plans for world government. as a result, people have lost faith in mainstream media, politicians and capitalism itself. 
this is the reason for the rise in conspiracy theory and paranoid politics. 
this is also the reason elites would like to shut down the internet, or at least control it more thoroughly. 
part of the push for control involves making a case that the internet needs to be better regulated and appropriately censored. 
to this end, elite propaganda has been aimed at justifying various anti-net actions. 
one justification involves the populism versus globalism meme weve covered extensively. just use a search engine for the phrase and daily bell. 
another justification  another emergent meme  is that government itself is jeopardized by pervasive distrust. 
one would think the answer would be to lie less, but this is not the conclusion were being furnished. 
both sunstein in his article, and now the argument in this article, show us clearly that the solution to pervasive electoral cyncism and worse is to better control ones attitude. 
in other words, paranoia and conspiratorial cynicism need to be damped for government to survive and perform its proper function. 
here 
why, then, did a seasoned operator like mr comey, whose judiciousness was praised by the clinton campaign through the summer, feel the need to divulge this half-baked and potentially insignificant development before assessing it? there is one answer fear of the mob. 
the director of the fbi  those tough guys who smash in doors and shoot people  was scared that if he didnt talk now and the news leaked out, it would confirm every conspiracy theory going about how the agency was in the clintons pocket. in other words, weve reached a point in the politics of the worlds most powerful democracy where the appearance of probity matters more than the reality. 
this is a key point in the article. it is one that fully reveals the cognitive dissonance at the heart of this particular argument. the idea is that government is too delicate to sustain itself in the face of the mob. the mob must therefore be silenced or probity will matter more than reality. 
but who is to determine what constitutes a mob? and who is determine that the mobs reality is false? 
both the sunstein article and now this one are erecting very specific kinds of arguments. government, we are told, is fragile and must be protected from forces that will undermine its credibility. 
but this conclusion is merely assumed. it is never proven. 
this argument begins and ends with government. yet the internet and its recovered history shows us clearly that western governments mostly provide concealment for the worlds real powers that prefer to operate behind the scenes. 
this is the reason for so much cynicism. many have realized that the society constructed around them is lie. they have reacted by distrusting almost anything associated with modern society. 
but in these articles, we can see the forces being marshaled against this state of mind. the preferred antidote is simply to assert that peoples distrust is corrosive to government authority and democracy generally. 
no logic bolsters this argument. thats why it is an emergent elite meme. 
the goal of an elite meme is to be convincing not truthful. 
and if it is not convincing  and increasingly elite memes are not  then its function is, anyway, to provide a justification for what we call directed history. these are the authoritarian strategies that elites wish to inflict on the rest of us. 
this latter meme is an outgrowth of populism versus globalism. populists, as weve pointed out, are being cast as ignorant, violent and intolerant. the current meme  lets call it conspiracy versus government lumps in conspiracy with populism. 
populists, we learn, are apt to adopt an irrational distrust of government. and what is government? it must comprise all that is good and virtuous in an uncivil world. 
both populists and conspiracy theory are to be vanquished, eventually, by wise globalists who understand that the absence of government will lead to violent anarchy. 
would that it were true. it is not. government is merely in this day-and-age a curtain hiding the worlds real controllers who use endless violence, monetary debasement and economic depression to get their way. 
conclusion we are watching the emergence of a new, dangerous memes. increasingly and forcefully, it is being argued that government is good and that the truths people have discovered about their lives and society are destabilizing to government, and therefore bad. the idea will be to use these memes to make a case for increased censorship and even, eventually, violent repression  and worse.",175,736268,fake
"tom hayden iraqbeyond the horizon, the storm by guitarsandmore , april 30, 2006 at 537 am link to this comment unregistered commenter 
there were the wise men, a discreet gathering of corporate lawyers, diplomats and security strategists who advised president johnson that the costs of vietnam were greater than any of the benefits. .. . as the new york times finally reported on monday, april 24, the wise men are being recreated through the iraq study group, funded by congress, co-chaired by james baker and lee hamilton, and including such power. 
it is funny how in this country it always comes down to economics and laws. i would think that in a true democracy the will of the people would prevail but apparently we always need a group of wise men too. 
the protest marches, work stoppages, civil disobedience, will all contribute to the high cost of the war and as this group of wise men conducts the study our efforts will all factor in. 
it will cost us more in the long run should we become known as the country that tried to control all of the worlds resources oil wells in iraq, iran, saudi arabia. the world will not think much of democracy if we continue to invade countries based on fears of what might happen. 
let the will of the people prevail.

excellent post professor hayden! i am glad to see you posting here where there is some substance to the blogs. your article is full of news, information, and valuable insights i have not been able to find elsewhere. thank you. 
so scott ritter is frustrated already! oh, boy! i first heard about the horrors of the vietnam war when i was 15 and still in high school. many years later in my twenties i was still protesting the vietnam war after seeing my friends uncle burn himself on the steps of the capitol building. 
as i recall certain peace activists were expressing concerns then too about one message being delivered by the peace movement and the right message as well. i was told to shut up and let those that can deliver a consistent singular message do so. 
students for a democratic society sds split into two factions; the progressive labor party and the weathermen. but i believe it was the many different groups coming together in april and may of 1970 in washington dc to march for peace that turned the tide of american opinion about vietnam. i remember riding in a station wagon loaded down with 10 people that belonged to a methodist minister and had no sds people in it at all. each person in that car had different reasons for marching but all came to protest the war. 
this weekend tens of thousands of protesters marched saturday through lower manhattan to demand an immediate withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq. 
everyone should continue to write to their senators and congressmen but also participate in the marches if possible. 
the only points we have to agree on are these 
1.stop the war in iraq 2.tell congress to cut off funding war. 3.no more preemptive strikes anywhere. 4.bring the troops home now. 
all of this should fit nicely on the front and back of two signs. you carry one and your significant other carries the other one. 
we can talk about how we are going to turn the oil economy into an alternate energy economy later. what we have to do right now is stop the u.s. war machine from marching across the entire world stamping out potential threats. 
if you have to choose between dynamite and peace marches i hope you choose peace marches.

generally speaking, i liked tom hydens piece and would identify with most of its premise. however, i have and apprehension about any movement that would identify its agenda as against war; as if war is a necessary human condition we await to happen, then we mobilize to oppose it, hence the anti-war movement. i want to be part of a movement that considers wars as the ultimate evil and the ultimate form of terrorism, which shoud be prevented with sound planned activism; but not wait to react to it after the fact of war is upon us. further, i want to be part of a movement for true democracy; not a democracy that can be sold to the highest bidders, who will always be the members of the merchants of death, represnted by the military-industial complex. i want to be part of a genuinly fair and just democracy that leads the world by example; and not be led by the wims of special interest groups, such as the israeli lobby. i want to be part of a movement that have at its core philosophy that might is not right. i want to be part of a genuine humanistic movement that recognizes, with regret, that we are living at a tumultuous moment in a 500-year history of crusades, slavery, colonialism and patriarchy, and we are going sincerely to make amends!

etspoon 1st reply in this thread makes a good point about this war being fought by those who want to be there. in canada a fair bit of political hay is made of this we-want-to-be-there mentality by soldiers, especially after theyve been killed. the media is usually filled with stories about the dead soldiers committment and their willingness to be at war. 
as in the us all canadians are being cajoled to support our troops. well, he fact is, as a taxpayer, i am supporting canadas troops, but against my will. 
sometimes it feels like the only reason were at war is so canadian conservatives can use our involvement in afghanistan as a pretext to spend a bunch of money my money on the military, something theyve wanted to do for decades. 
i suggest that peace activists in both our countries start a tax revolt until a mechanism is in place that ensures supporters are the ones that foot the bill for the wars they want. this would certainly be in line with the long-touted user-pay principle that most war supporters inist on in virtually every other case where public monies are spent.

thank you, tom, for your percpective on the current state of the peace movement and, by extension, the progressive radical movement in general. this really does seem to be the best of times and the worst of times. the peace movement has made a tremendous difference in keeping the issue of the irag war from simply becoming part of the background noise of daily life. it does seem, however, to be struggling against an immensely powerful current of apathy and indifference. progressive radicalism too has helped to focus public attention, however fleetingly, on a broad array of pertinent issues. still, the movement, as a whole, seems to have devolved into a fractious multi- tude of cliques whose exclusionary ideological rigidity and seeming dependence on confrontational theatrics discourages committed involvement. 
in many ways this is no different than the conditions present during the viet nam era. the anti-war movement faced a tremendous uphill battle against public opinion and government repression. other issues, when they were understood at all, faced reactions ranging from condesending amusement to violent hostility. proponents of peace and other issues utilized an array of tactics ranging from reasoned discourse, to non-violent civil disobedience, to carnival antics, to paramilitary, guerrilla violence. 
still, there are signigicant differences between then and now. for one thing, this is not all new. weve seen this type of thing before. early in the viet nam war, those in opposition based their position on comprehensive pacifism and anti-imperialism. it took the revelations of daniel ellsberg and the release of the pentagon papers to expose the general public to the mind set of the decision makers in the executive branch, the intelligence community, and the military, and to the lies, deceptions, and covert, provocative actions under- taken to involve the nation in a predetermined and unnecessary war. this time around, the charges of deception and fraud began before the war started and the evidense to support those charges followed on immediately. public disillusionment has taken months not years. let us see how this disillusionment translates into votes in the mid-term elections. 
secondly, there is no draft as we knew it then. young men of college age women are still not required to register are not currently faced with the life or death possiblity of being called to involuntary military service and probable combat duty. the disproportionate representation of minorities among combat casualties is also not a current factor. the backdoor draft created by the deployment of national guard units to a degree unprecedented in history, the calling up of reservists some of whom have been effectively out of the military for years, and the indefinite extension of tours of duty has temporarily filled the militarys manpower needs. this has left the military to be viewed by many, if not most, as a volunteer force, serving in one sense or another by choice. it has also left the vast majority of otherwise draft elgible men free to pursue other options. this lack of direct personal involvement makes this particular population segment difficult to galvanize in to political action as they were during viet nam. it may well be the returning veterans of the irag war, including significant numbers of women some greviously wounded, who will form one of the most prominent segments of the current anti-war move- ment. senator kerry and other members of the viet nam veterans against the war, still active in politics and progressive causes, should cultivate this group with particular care. 
third, the anti-war movement has thusfar avoided making some of the more egregiously boneheaded errors of the viet nam era. the labeling of common soldiers as baby killers, the disrespect, mistreatment, and abuse of returning veterans, and the general indifference to their hardships and very existence by large portions of the movement and general public have been largely avoided. the well intentioned, but utterly inappropriate, gestures of high-profile celeb- rities meeting with the leadership of opposing forces, visiting territories con- trolled by them, and touring their military facilities has also been avoided. those mistakes continue to haunt the peace movement and have, in all like- lihood, contributed to the initial public support for the bush administrations policies and reluctance to give credibility to those opposed to those policies. it is gratifying to see that the peace movement is able to learn from its errors even if this nations leadership cannot. 
fourth, while congress possessed a solid and powerful cadre of leaders opposed to the viet nam war in the form of senators morse, hatfield, mccarthy, muskie, mcgovern, and kennedy as well as several members of the house of representatives, it still took years to develop any significant oppo- sition to white house policy in viet nam. it was not until the release of the pentagon papers that support for the war began to evaporate, and it was not until watergate that political support for the nixon administration disap- peared. today there is a much broader base of opposition in the congress and, after the initial acquiesence to president bushs call to arms, that oppo- sition has coalesced and stood strong. it is only the minority status of the democratic representatives and the iron grip of the republican party over its members that is keeping all support from collapsing in the face of mounting evidence of fraud, deceipt, and the abuse of power by this administration. 
finally, you may be right, tom. the movement has, in many ways, become mainstream. maybe the radicals are disappearing in the midst of their own success. the array of issues that formed the great, broad umbrella of the counter culture have spread widely throughout the society as a whole. things that once appeared alien and outrageous have now become common- place. ideas that once appeared to be held only by prophetic minorities are now the intellectual property of anyone with the courage and independence to subscribe. this is, in part, a product of our information age and it is a good thing. 
it is good to see that some of you old hands are still out there and speaking up, tom. your book, reunion, random house, new york, was quite infor- mative. with examples like you it will be easier for some of us to be winter soldiers in a long war, and spread the viet nam syndrome everywhere.

thought his 04 loss was caused by a variety of factors republican fear and wedge strategy, corporate media complicity, national democratic party ineptitude, tactical vote suppression, et al he must be held personally accountable for his incredibly off kilter campaign. 
it seems to me that some of the other possible candidates have gotten a clue on issues, bearing and process. though im not ready to commit at this point, ill certainly going to take a hard look at gore, edwards and feingold for starters.

sen. john kerrys call for military withdrawal by the end of this year. kerry stands a definite chance of filling the moral void in the present political process. when he steadfastly embraces his record as a young man, the message resonates in several ways. 
i am a former member of john kerrys vietnam vets against the war. 
oh, how i wish that john kerry or someone from that eras anti-war movement would embrace their earlier principles. 
during his shameful presidential run kerry ran away from his youthful principled stand against the vietnam war. i kept waiting for him to resolutely defend his anti-war past. 
the only thing he has said recently that resonated with me was his referrence to how many men died so needlessly after it was clear there was no military solution in vietnam. 
there is no military solution in iraq!!! 
men dieing there as we speak are dieing to salvage the political careers of bush and company and even kerry if he doesnt take a stronger stand!

whether america accepts it or not it has lost the war in iraq. 
as predicted by many the country has descended into civil war. 
now to add the folly of assaulting iran will, in the words of the editorial writer of the daily times, see the region erupt in flames. 
it is time for the american people to demand the return of the troops, demand a complete reassesment and retrenching of american foreign policy, to demand that american leaders address americas internal problems, to demand americas leaders abandon their desire to rule the world. 
and possibly, just possibly, return democracy to america.

just as military leaders sometimes prepare to fight the wars of the past, political movements can become mired in views of the world that have been discredited. 
certainly the absence of effective political oppostition to the war and any large demonstrations against the war is an indication that something is missing 
is it just a question of leadership, or has the country become conservative after all? if that is the reason, then political rants against the war will not make one bit of difference. 
the anti war movement can only dream of having mass demonstrations on the scale of the recent pro amnesty immigration protests. 
on the other hand there is nothing like loosing to make your point 
when americans defeat in iraq does come, americas political leaders will have a better understanding of the politics of americas citizens.

the america sad denial case 
your war against fear is not justified. it is actually a resource war for oil, and a currency war for the dollar. global oil production has peaked and us will suffer the most from this crisis. the united states uses 25 of the worlds oil yet only has 5 of the worlds population. america is heavily in debt and bankruptcy is unavoidable. the coming housing bust will send the economy into a second greater depression. 
while the middle east countries find themselves targets in the war on terror, china, russia, and latin america find themselves targets in the recently declared and much more expansive war on tyranny. whereas the war on terror is really a war for control of the worlds oil reserves, this newly declared war on tyranny is really a war for control of the worlds oil distribution and transportation chokepoints. 
the dollar is in collapse, the economy is going to crash, oil is getting more scarce everyday. america is a nation that has its infrastructure built exclusively to be run on abundant cheap oil, with global demand of oil increasing exponentially and supply decreasing year after year, america has no other choice than to wage a global war on oil and currency and under the ruse of terror and freedom. 
what? no believe? you still denial?? 
is your entire country on crack? are all you americans out of your cotton picking minds? are you completely freaking delusional? homicidal? psychotic? have you lost any shred of a moral compass? what in the name of jesus h. christ on a crutch is wrong with you people 
let me offer up one small datum which may completely change the equation for you according to the cia if they have any credibility left. even accord to them iran is at least five years away from a nuclear weapon. 
five years. 
five years is time for diplomacy to accomplish a hell of a lot. 
i would also point out that the atomic energy commission, various other international bodies and other inspections have essentially found no sign that iran is even working on a nuclear weapon. 
the only actual evidence that iran has anything close to nuclear weapons technology is blueprints that the cia gave to them! 
have you all forgotten that the evidence on iraq was spectacularly wrong? have you all ignored the fact that it was fabricated? why then are we going down the exact same road of stage managed, fabricated pseudo-evidence and wild-ass hysteria? 
what is wrong with you people? 
this entire crisis has been manufactured, and has been years in the making. 
stop and think back five years. what did we have five years ago? a moderate reformist iranian government making overtures to the united states, rebuilding its relationship with europe, liberalizing its society, and modernizing its economy. 
post 911 vigil in iran. 911 comes along, the iranians are overflowing with sympathy. mass candlelit vigils are held in tehran. iran offers aid and cooperation. 
iran hates the taliban who have executed iranian diplomats and massacred afghan shiites. iran hates saddam hussein. iran hates al qaeda which is a sunni fundamentalist organization which declares shiites infidels and subhuman. 
iran shares its intelligence with america - they even arrested taliban members and handed them over to us custody. 
so weve got the iranian spring; things are finally going to sort out. 
and what happens? the bush administration rebuffs every iranian overture and does its best to instigate a cold war. afghanistan is invaded, and suddenly, the iranians are looking at american troops and allies on their eastern border. then iraq is invaded, and american troops and allies on their western border. then bases and treaties in uzbekistan, and whoops, theres more american troops and allies on the northern border. the persian gulf is filled with american warships and carrier fleets. 
now the iranians are surrounded. and the tough talk is constant. iran is part of the axis of evil and americans tell each other baghdad, humph, real men go to tehran. essentially, america has been threatening military action against iran for the last five years, and has surrounded the country on every side with troops, bases and allies. 
american aircraft invade iranian airspace regularly, american special forces undertake operations inside iran and americans regularly accuse iranians of interference in iraq. 
dick cheney pontificates about israel bombing iran after he has just handed over to israel the long range bombers and bunker busting bombs required to do the job. 
meanwhile, the united states undertakes economic warfare against iran, interfering with its business dealings with third party countries, trying to scuttle a pipeline deal with india, and it goes on and on. the hysteria about the iranians nuclear program is just more of the same. 
now how in gods bloody name do you think the iranians are going to respond to that. should they concede the nuclear program, abandon their pipeline project? if so, its not going to do them any good. america will just seek more concessions. each surrender will be met by new demands. this isnt hard to figure out. its exactly what bush did with iraq. 
perhaps overtures, good will gestures, trying to act like a peaceful nation. did all those things, doesnt matter. the bush administration is still on a collision course. 
so, the mullahs are concerned that theyre faced with a homicidal crazy state, the iranian people are scared. when people are scared and faced with an aggressive warmongering power which keeps threatening to attack them, continually trespasses on its borders and is undertaking economic warfare who the hell are they going to elect? ahminajad may be a crazy bastard, but you assholes, you utter assholes did every thing you could to elect him short of donating 50,000 diebold machines and mailing his party the trapdoor codes. 
so, having pursued a psychotically aggressive course, youve backed iran into a corner, and engineered a regime which refuses to back further. 
and you are the victims in all this? you are the ones under threat? its self defense???? 
and of course, you goofily believe that you can just bomb or nuke iran with impunity? 
holy microeconomic theory batman! irans nuclear facilities are distributed across the country and in hardened sites near population centers. so any strike that cripples a significant portion of irans nuclear capacity will inevitably be so large and kill so many people that its going to be tantamount to inviting full scale war. 
think about that. iran is 70 million people, an area five times the size of iraq, not disemboweled by 12 years of sanctions and air raids. on the other side of the coin, americas ground army is busted and tied down in iraq. theres no troops to throw at a major iranian military force, so you have to hope that bombing will do the trick. the occupation forces in iraq are in occupation and not territorial defense mode. and iraq is 65 shiites who are probably not going to be happy that youre blowing up their brother shiites. 
meanwhile, the strait of hormuz is so narrow that sinking one supertanker will block it indefinitely, and iran borders the strait on three sides. block hormuz and any naval groups inside the persian gulf are trapped there. any naval groups outside the persian gulf are trapped outside. forget about any oil coming out of the persian gulf from iraq, kuwait, quatar, bahrain, saudi arabia or the uae. think about what that does to the price of oil, and to the world economy. think about what that does to dependent countries like japan, india, china and europe. 
in short its so appallingly stupid and colossally risky, that i can see why your idiots in charge might consider using nuclear weapons. but throw a few nukes around and see how the rest of the world reacts? every dirt-wad country is going to be mortgaging the presidential palace to get its own nuclear deterrent from pakistan or north korea. how do you feel about the indonesian bomb, the malaysian bomb, the thai bomb, the myanmar bomb, the algerian bomb, the saudi bomb, the egyptian bomb, the brazilian bomb, the argentine bomb, the venezuelan bomb, the cuban bomb, the japanese bomb, the canadian frigging bomb. you are no longer trustworthy. north korea, always borderline psychotic is going to be mondo difficult to deal with. youve just guaranteed yourself a full fledged nuclear arms race, balls to the wall with both russia and china, and quite possibly europe. 
and of course theres no guarantee that the rest of the world will allow this. do you want an armed standoff with the russians? suppose they loan their finest interceptor jets, pilots and radar systems to the iranians do you want to meet that on a bombing raid? and if you do meet that what are you going to do when half your planes are blasted out of the skies conducting an illegal raid on civilian populations in a foreign country? cry? send a harsh note? 
launch a first strike? 
world goes boom. what happens if the chinese decide to hold taiwan and south korea hostage? what do you do? back off iran or sell out east asia? 
hell, in that kind of standoff, someone sneezes and its not going to matter who launched a first strike. 
or would you like an economic standoff, say with europe, or with japan and china. suppose that the europeans or chinese decide screw the worldwide depression, you assholes are just too dangerous to have around. trillions of dollars get dumped on the market, loans get called in, the bottom drops out of your dollar, its thousand per cent inflation and no manufacturing base and your own trade embargoes. so much for america. 
i mean, its morally wrong; its stupid on every level. and yet here you are discussing why maybe you should get out in front of the republicans on this, or planning your surrender to bush. why are you even discussing this? 
what is wrong with america? 
case in iraq 
anyone here still remember the scam of al samoud 2? 
i totally forgot about it until today when i read that iran has enriched a supply of uranium for the first time and irans president has said iran wont back down one iota over its nuclear program. 
remember when saddam backed down? its been so long even my memorys been washed by washington, but before the wmb bullshit we were hearing ranting and trash from bush that it was because of iraqs al samoud 2 missiles had 10 miles extra range than allowed by the un funny how us itself never follows un regulations that the us was going to attack iraq. al samoud 2 was a big issue for a while, and bush gave saddam an ultimatum of a week or so to disarm and destroy all 90 some missiles or else the us evil empire was going to attack.

"дело компании хунсян и американское давление на кнр  новое восточное обозрение страна китай 26 сентября 2016 г. сша ввели санкции против китайской компании, связанной с северокорейской программой развития ядерного и ракетного оружия. речь идет о dandong hongxiang industrial development сокращенно  хунсян груп, которая занимается поставками промышленного оборудования, и её четырёх представителях. министерство финансов сша официально включило их в санкционный список. всё имущество и активы компании и её руководства на территории сша замораживаются, и ряд южнокорейских источников сообщают, что компания фактически прекратила деятельность, а ее сайт закрыт. китайские правоохранительные органы также расследуют дело корпорации хунсян груп, привлекая связанные с ней северокорейские компании, в том числе северокорейский банк квансон, который входит в список объектов санкций сб оон, но является главным акционером логистической компании в даньдуне, входящей в состав хунсян груп. глава представительства банка в городском округе даньдун провинции ляонин был вызван для дачи показаний, а северокорейским торговым представителям запретили выезжать из страны. в чем провинилась данная корпорация? хунсян груп подозревают в поставках северу комплектующих и материалов, имеющих отношение к ядерной программе, в том числе оксида алюминия, триоксида вольфрама и иных товаров двойного назначения, которые можно использовать для обогащения урана. главный источник обвинений  совместное исследование южнокорейского института асан и американского центра продвинутых оборонных исследований u.s. center for advanced defense studies. также, как сообщил и.о. замминистра финансов сша адам шубин, сотрудники хунсян груп стремились уклониться от санкций, введённых сша и оон, облегчая доступ пхеньяну к американской финансовой системе. они, в частности, предоставляли финансовые услуги вышеупомянутому банку квансон, который управлял средствами хунсян груп и расчётами при выполнении экспортных и импортных операций с кндр. предположительно, компания отмывала северокорейские деньги через подставные компании, работавшие с банками сша. по данным южнокорейских экспертов, которые будто бы и обратили внимание на данный факт, в 2011-15 гг. компания вложила в северокорейский бизнес 532 миллиона долларов, при том что строительство реактора в енбене стоило менее 700 млн. китайскую фирму обвиняют даже в поддержке северокорейских хакеров! как отмечает сми сша, впервые администрация обамы ударила по китайской фирме, и история dandong hongxiang industrial development co является примером как китайской поддержки режима ким чен ына, так и того, что сша могут сделать для обрыва таких контактов. при этом в америке открыто говорят, что введение санкций против компании hongxiang должно сыграть роль, аналогичную репрессиям против banco delta asia в 2005 г.  сигнал китайским компаниям прервать отношения с кндр или испытать ту же участь. правда, пока минюст сша отметил, что против связанных с hongxiang банков кнр обвинений не выдвигается, и это вызывает негодование сторонников жесткого курса. в открытом письме обаме 19 сенаторов указали, что банк китая предположительно помог клиентам, связанным с кндр, получить из американских банков 40 млн долларов, и хотя предположения и связанность клиентов с северной кореей еще надо расследовать, санкции вводить надо  иначе как еще остановить угрозу и преподать урок нарушителям!? как заявил 21 сентября 2016 г. высокопоставленный представитель белого дома, заместитель советника по национальной безопасности бен родс, кнр обязан предотвращать экспорт в кндр запрещенных товаров, особенно продукции двойного назначения. он заявил, что от пекина ожидается соответствующий ответ на провокации, которые могут привести к дополнительным санкциям. с ним согласен главный специалист снб сша по вопросам нераспространения джон вульфсталь резолюции оон ясно запрещают экспорт любых товаров, которые могут использоваться для развития ракетно-ядерной программы пхеньяна, даже если речь идет о карандашах . запрещаем все, кроме того, что можно убедительно обосновать как поддержку гуманитарных целей. на этом фоне между сша и кнр разгорается еще одно противоречие, связанное с торговлей углем между пекином и пхеньяном. если америка пытается прервать эти поставки то, как заявил 28 сентября официальный представитель мид кнр гэн шуан, эта торговля ведётся в соответствии с предписаниями и резолюциями, а также национальным законодательством и нормативными актами кнр, не нарушает норм международного права и резолюций оон с санкциями в отношении пхеньяна, которые вполне допускают торговлю севера углем. это заявление было ответом на выступление помощника госсекретаря сша дэниела рассела, в котором он заявил, что сша работают над перекрытием лазеек для получения севером валюты. в этом контексте рассел отметил, что север ежегодно зарабатывает от продажи угля в китай 1 млрд долларов, что составляет треть общей суммы северокорейского экспорта, однако пункт о возможности экспорта северокорейского угля был включён в резолюции сб оон с учётом позиции китая. хотя южане пытаются представить дело так, что резолюция 2270, принятая сб оон в марте 2016 года, вообще запрещает импортировать северокорейский уголь, речь идет о запрете на поставки, доход от которых может пойти на развитие ракетно-ядерной программы. в результате объем ввоза угля в китай увеличивается. 24 сентября японская газета нихон кейдзай опубликовала статью, в которой отмечается, что в апреле этого года объем импорта угля из ск в кнр резко сократился на 38 по сравнению с аналогичным периодом прошлого года, и такая тенденция продолжалась до июля. однако в августе данный показатель начал расти, увеличившись на 27,5 в годовом исчислении. общий объем торговли между ск и китаем также увеличился на 30. эксперты рк полагают, что восстановление импорта в китай северокорейских товаров произошло из-за смягчения контроля китайского правительства, которое выражает недовольство по поводу размещения про thaad на корейском полуострове. так что попытка навязать пекину односторонние санкции пока не удается. и более того, там постоянно подчеркивается, что китай выступает против односторонних санкций, которые не помогают разрешить вопрос. так, в частности, заявил 15 сентября министр иностранных дел кнр ван и в телефонном разговоре со своим японским коллегой фумио кисидой, и та же позиция прозвучала 22 сентября на встрече спецпредставителей правительств кнр и рк, где обсуждались ответные меры в отношении проведённого пхеньяном пятого ядерного испытания. сообщается, что южнокорейская сторона потребовала от китая принятия более жестких санкций в отношении пхеньяна, в том числе запретить наземную перевозку грузов, на что китайская сторона ответила отказом. скрываемый разлад нашел свое отражение и в заявлении генсека оон пан ги муна, который высказал недовольство относительно задержки принятия дополнительных санкций в ответ на пятое ядерное испытание кндр. по его словам, сб оон затрачивает на это излишне много времени. между тем позиция кнр в отношении санкций против севера вполне ясна. как отмечается в представленном на сеульском форуме объединение кореи и вопросы безопасности докладе старшего научного сотрудника института седжона чун чжэ хона, китай не склонен поддерживать применение против кндр санкций, которые приведут к падению в стране существующего режима и ухудшению положения северокорейцев. по словам докладчика, крах режима ким чен ына чреват непредсказуемыми последствиями, включая и объединение обеих корей под руководством сеула. пекин не хочет появления у своих границ объединенной кореи, являющейся союзником сша, и сделает все возможное для срыва такого сценария. соответственно, выполняя резолюции оон и не превышая их за счет дополнительных односторонних мер, как это делают сша или их союзники, китайское правительство четко ограничило уровень санкций в отношении пхеньяна, который ни при каких обстоятельствах не превысит. константин асмолов, кандидат исторических наук, ведущий научный сотрудник центра корейских исследований института дальнего востока ран, специально для интернет-журнала новое восточное обозрение. популярные статьи",98,736265,fake

"secret recordings fueled fbi feud in clinton probe home  politics  us news  secret recordings fueled fbi feud in clinton probe secret recordings fueled fbi feud in clinton probe 0 shares 11316 secret recordings of a suspect talking about the clinton foundation fueled an internal battle between fbi agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said. 
agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called clinton cash the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich, these people said. 
the account of the case and resulting dispute comes from interviews with officials at multiple agencies. 
starting in february and continuing today, investigators from the federal bureau of investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. at the center of the tension stood the u.s. attorney for brooklyn, robert capers, who some at the fbi came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. through a spokeswoman, mr. capers declined to comment. 
the roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether clinton foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the state department under hillary clinton. 
senior officials in the justice department and the fbi didnt think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldnt let them pursue, they said. 
these details on the probe are emerging amid the continuing furor surrounding fbi director james comeys disclosure to congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate, previously closed fbi investigation of mrs. clintons email arrangement while she was secretary of state. 
on wednesday, president barack obama took the unusual step of criticizing the fbi when asked about mr. comeys disclosure of the emails. 
amid the internal finger-pointing on the clinton foundation matter, some have blamed the fbis no. 2 official, deputy director andrew mccabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. his defenders deny that, and say it was the justice department that kept pushing back on the investigation. 
at times, people on both sides of the dispute thought mr. capers agreed with them. defenders of mr. capers said he was straightforward and always told people he thought the case wasnt strong. post navigation warning  array_key_exists expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in homecontentp3pnexwpnas07_data02053222705htmlwp-contentpluginswidget-optionscorefunctions.widget.display.php on line 182 warning  array_key_exists expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in homecontentp3pnexwpnas07_data02053222705htmlwp-contentpluginswidget-optionscorefunctions.widget.display.php on line 182 warning  array_key_exists expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in homecontentp3pnexwpnas07_data02053222705htmlwp-contentpluginswidget-optionscorefunctions.widget.display.php on line 182 warning  array_key_exists expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in homecontentp3pnexwpnas07_data02053222705htmlwp-contentpluginswidget-optionscorefunctions.widget.display.php on line 182 resources",78,736271,fake

"5 reasons to try acupuncture for baby eczema keywords acupuncture , baby eczema , cure baby eczema , eczema cure , eczema treatment , heal eczema 
there was a time when my sons eczema became so severe i was willing to try any natural healing method. my baby was 5 months old when he developed eczema. we tried the usual dose of steroids and over-the-counter creams from our family doctor. it got so bad that his scars were not healing. he wasnt sleeping. and i wasnt sleeping. as a child, my mother took me to an acupuncturist for migraines. and the migraines stopped after a handful of visits. i remember it being a pretty relaxing experience with the smell of incense and herbs and the quietness of the room. so, i took a leap of faith and booked us for an appointment with a traditional chinese doctor who specialized in skin disorders, allergies, and asthma. why try acupuncture  traditional chinese medicine? reason 1 acupuncture has been practiced for almost 4000 years in china. 
with that much history, its worth a try. it is a method of relieving pain or curing an illness by placing needles in the patients body at precise points along the 12 meridians in the body. meridians are energy pathways that are associated with different organs within the body. the world health organization lists 300 ailments that are treatable by chinese medicine  acupuncture. reason 2 acupuncture has helped children with eczema 
in a study of 37 children who were treated with chinese medicinal herbs, the treatment reduced eczema symptoms by 90 in 18 of the children see sources. although it was a small study size, the benefits seem to far outweigh the risks. when my son was a baby, even a 10 improvement in his symptoms would have been amazing for us. reason 3 acupuncture does not hurt babies 
many people worry about the needles hurting. but the needles that acupuncturists use are about 1100 th of a syringe needle. my son was a baby when we started the treatments, and he never cried out when getting the needles in him. reason 4 acupuncture relieved my babys eczema by 80 
acupuncture healed the eczema to the point where we could figure out his triggers. our doctor stabilized the eczema. best of all, flare-ups only occurred when my baby was teething. his skin was softer than it had been in months. acupuncture needs to be done on babies for a minimum of 3 months in order to see an improvement. this is because the treatment is trying to alter the immune response, which is a long process. but sometimes babies will respond quicker than that. we used a topical herb powder given to us by the doctor, and applied it to his skin. this topical mix had a similar effect as hydro-cortisone cream if i applied it 3-5 times per day with a cotton ball. reason 5 acupuncture is affordable 
this is true especially if you go to a student clinic. you can pay the affordable price and yet the students are supervised by very experienced doctors. for child and baby treatments, it is even more affordable. it cost us about 15-30 per visit on average we tried a few different clinics. some health plans will cover acupuncture, so check with your health plan to see if yours covers it. to keep it affordable, i suggest trying to find a specialist in acupuncture  tcm traditional chinese medicine, not a practitioner who does many different types of treatments. tips for helping your child while getting acupuncture 
bring a favorite stuffed animal, a book, or some toys. try nursing your baby while they are receiving acupuncture. a baby only needs the needle in the acupressure point for a second and then they are pulled out. adults typically have needles in for 45 minutes for each treatment, because our bodies do not respond as quickly as babies bodies do. check out my youtube video for more tips! find an experienced  accredited acupuncturist 
make sure to look for an accredited acupuncturist or tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor. be sure the acupuncturist has some experience in your condition. chat with the people in the waiting room. and see if theyve had success with your doctor. i met a few moms in the waiting room that swore by the chinese doctor we were going to see. that made me feel more comfortable. 
find a tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor who offers certified organic chinese herbs. certified organic means the herbs were never sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides. as well, there have been some reports of heavy metals residue in chinese herbs. herbs are just as powerful as prescription medications and can have adverse effects if used improperly. make sure to ask about the testing done on the herbs that you or your baby are prescribed. every condition has different treatment needs 
check with your family doctor to be sure you dont have any conditions that would prevent you from using acupuncture or chinese medicine. all the information in this article is provided for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for medical counseling.

"getting 10 minutes of sunlight per day can stop depression getting 10 minutes of sunlight per day can stop depression vitamin d is one of the most important vitamins your body needs image credits michael pollakflickr . 
vitamin d is one of the most important vitamins you can give your body. 
this vitamin can affect nearly 2,000 genes in your body, and the best part of it is that you dont even need a supplement to get your full recommended amount of vitamin d  you only need to get out in the sun for a few minutes a day. 
vitamin d is beneficial for staving off depression. without the required amount of vitamin d in your diet or the necessary amount of time spent in the sun, you can experience and excessively low mood and other signs of depression. 
and one of the most well-known and important benefits of vitamin d is the effect it has an calcium absorption and building healthy bones. 
this is especially important for children, as the vitamin helps with bone growth as well as developing strong teeth. those who do not have enough vitamin d may find themselves at risk for fractures or soft bones. 
thus, vitamin d is not only important for children, but also women who can be susceptible to brittle bones as they age. 
the vitamin may also play a crucial role in helping your body ward off disease. studies suggest that getting in enough vitamin d can help ward off multiple sclerosis, heart disease and help your body steer clear of the dreaded flu. 
if you dont get enough vitamin d, you may find yourself feeling tired or experiencing general aches and pains. if the deficiency is severe enough, you may also find yourself developing stress fractures. 
so how do you get enough vitamin d in your diet? 
you can always purchase supplements, most of which contain enough, or in some cases, more than enough of your daily recommended allowance. 
it is also naturally found in salmon, sardines, egg yolk and shrimp. milk, cereal, yogurt and orange juice are often fortified with vitamin d to ensure that you get the recommended amount. 
for those who live in a sunny climate, spending 10 minutes outside per day can actually give you the required amount of vitamin d. although it is not advisable to spend too long outside without protection from the sun in the form of sun block or extra layers of clothing, it is recommended that you do get outside for at least a small part of the day to soak up those rays. 
you can, however, get all of the benefits of vitamin d in your diet or by taking supplements during the winter months when the sun takes a rest, or if you happen to live in a colder climate. newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew. related articles",92,736263,fake

almost 14 years later, the lessons of iraq are well known illegally invade a sovereign country which threatens no one and expect hell, instability, blood, torture and terror as a consequence. the lessons were not remembered by hillary clinton who along with david cameron and nicholas sarkozy dragged a hesitant barack obama into a war in libya, a war whose outcome is even more disastrous than the war in iraq. 
the wider public, however, have learned the lessons. both in europe and in america, the general public are fed up of war. some are too naïve or too arrogant to openly associate themselves with those of us who warned of the dangers a war on iraq would unleash. but they too have learned the lessons. it is one of the reasons donald trump continually states his opposition to the war in iraq which then senator hillary clinton voted for. 
this is why the mainstream media are in fits of hysterics trying to do the bidding of their war monger masters in attempting to convince the public to support doing to assad what was illegally done to saddam and gaddafi.since 2003 not only have the lessons of iraq been instructive to erstwhile war supporters in the west, the media landscape has also changed significantly. television channels like rt did not exist in 2003 but now they present rational claims from not just the west but around the world, against the calls for war. 
in hindsight, the internet had not fully blossomed by 2003, much though it felt that it had done at the time. today many news and analysis websites put the failing newspapers to shame. they are an instantaneous source of valuable information. 
wikileaks did not exist in 2003, but since its inception in 2006, it has blown the lid on the sadistic things governments do, how they do them and the sinister motives behind them. one cannot dismiss oppositional viewpoints as conspiratorial when one reads the documents which speak the truth in black and white. 
but most importantly yet surprisingly least talked about, is the fact that syrians have the internet, they have cameras, they have websites and they are using them. in 2003, the western media attempted to demonize the proud and highly educated iraqi people either as gangs of saddamite stooges or as opposed unpatriotic invalids without minds. because of the poor education system in countries like america, many believed this without questioning more. 
today, though, no matter what the mainstream media say, the voices of the syrian people cannot be drowned out. 
indeed, the duran frequently publishes pieces by afraa dagher , an actual syrian as opposed to samantha power who pretends to speak for syrians against their wishes. there are videos on youtube, statements in english from syrian journalists, experts, and the legitimate government. this are being read and circulated on social media. the mainstream media monopoly is over. 
it is often viewed as a platitude to say that ideas and the dissemination of ideas can change the world. but the aggregate effect of opposition media like rt, wikileaks, online expert opinion and analysis and the power of social media may well have saved syria from the fate of yugoslavia, iraq, and libya. tags",102,736265,fake

"10 images that perfectly illustrate the struggle against the dakota access pipeline by nick bernabe
the struggle to stop the dakota access pipeline has been mired in police brutality and militarization. in fact, many have likened the atmosphere in standing rock, north dakota, to a war zone.
the corporate media initially refused to cover the dakota access pipeline protests, though the ongoing storys virality on social media eventually forced it into the mainstream. even now that the nodapl movement has developed into a national political narrative, the media continues to whitewash the severity of the crackdown against the native american protesters, who call themselves water protectors.

"rigged election hillary  trump caught partying with kissinger at jesuit gala by covert geopolitics
we have been very, very suspicious of donald trump since he began his political run.
many believed he was an outsider who was our only hope to tame the us federal government beast. but it has become very clear he is not.
first, wikileaks showed that killary herself actually approved trump to be her competitor. according to an email sent from an assistant at the clinton campaign, hillary was aware that trump was going to run before the political process was fully underway.
clinton advised the mainstream media to push his legitimacy as a pied piper candidate because she realized, after looking at the poll numbers, that she wouldnt stand a chance at winning the presidency against any of the establishment republicans without making them pied pipers  it just so happened that donald was the easiest to play the role considering his long history of friendship with the clintons.

in addition, the mainstream media was more than complicit in creating a narrative that the 2016 presidential elections were about hillary clinton vs donald trump from the get go.
but, barely reported in the media, was that after the 3rd presidential debate, clinton and trump went out for a night on the town together and where they went is of great interest.
they went to an annual jesuit function which is usually full of new world order types.
the jesuits one of the more interesting things that occurred right at the end of the jubilee year in early october, was that the jesuits installed a new superior general, with the date to commence being actually at midnight on the end of jubilee.
we found this interesting because there is plenty of evidence that the jesuits are at least one major arm of what you can call the illuminati.
in fact, the jesuits were founded in spain by what various reports call crypto jews  those who are jewish but pretending to be catholic. certainly at that time in spain it was safer not to be a jew.
even wikipedia, which wouldnt recognize a conspiracy if it were directly presented by its participants has this to say about the jesuits
 in the first 30 years of the existence of the society of jesus there were many jesuit conversos catholic-convert jews including the second father general diego lainez  the original founder ignatius  said that he, would take it as a special grace from our lord to come from jewish lineage. 
at the beginning of the al smith dinner party after cardinal dolan was introduced, a joke was even made by a speaker that everyone in attendance is doing their part in supporting their charitable efforts and that it couldnt be done without the support of many of the other devoted catholics on stage like henry kissinger, howard rubenstein, and mort zuckerman  all of whom are obviously jewish so this remark was naturally met with a lot of laughter
in fact, an extraordinary amount of controversy swirls around jesuits. they are said to constitute the black church and thus adhere to the same satanic religion as the worlds elite bankers supposedly hold.
the leader of the jesuit order is commonly recognized in conspiratorial circles as the black pope whose signature staff is a crooked cross. historically, the jesuit order has been seen as one that shirks no crime in expanding the power of the church.
lest this sound entirely outrageous, one must note that the jesuits are, for instance, the inventors of concentration camps, which they established in paraguay in order to incarcerate and then torture the native indians of the area.
but the litany of attributed jesuit evil is even darker than that according to those who believe in the orders continued malicious pursuit. the supposed founder of the bavarian-based illuminati, adam weishaupt, was a jesuit.
in fact, the order is reputed to have been deeply involved in the illuminatis initial expansion, and chances are it is still deeply involved.
one more thing that highlights the evil of the jesuits is their extreme oath of induction which all superiors must take in order to be elevated to the higher rungs of the organization. this is taken from the book subterranean rome by carlos didier, translated from the french, and published in new york in 1843 and reads in part,
promise and declare that i will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, protestants and liberals, as i am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that i will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that i will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. that when the same cannot be done openly, i will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as i at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the pope or superior of the brotherhood of the holy faith, of the society of jesus
one of the most poignant quotes regarding the malevolence of the jesuits comes from marquis de lafayette 1757-1834; who was a french statesman and general who served in the american continental army under the command of general george washington during the american revolutionary war.
his quote is as follows
it is my opinion that if the liberties of this country  the united states of america  are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the roman catholic jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. they have instigated most of the wars of europe.
the big bash when evaluating jesuit behavior and influence, please keep in mind that both donald trump and hillarys vp, tim kaine, are jesuit educated. and it should be of great interest, therefore, that practically on the eve of the us election, donald trump and hillary clinton partied the night away at a jesuit function that included such prominent jesuit-trained attendees as henry kissinger.
not only did the two not look like sworn enemies they looked like two star crossed lovers going to their first prom.
we have long held to our stance that killary will be the next president of the us. the amount of vote rigging, murders and shenanigans to even get her to where she is so far has been tremendous and it wont stop.
that said, if by some fluke, and the diebold machines malfunction or people in the us wake up slightly and donald trump gets elected it is pretty clear they are on the same team and, as weve said previously, nothing major will change.
so, if you were hoping that this election could change things in the us get over that hope right now. it might change things, but only for the much, much worse.
this charade is being played right in front of everyones eyes and most do not understand what is happening or why jokes like the catholic joke is actually funny to these elite people.
they are laughing at the peasants stupidity and lack of understanding, not because the men mentioned are jews anyone with half a brain knows that.
 the groundwork for global governance has been laid, dont let them blindside you as they attempt to carry out their nefarious plot. donald trump even stated at the dinner, weve got to come together, not only as a nation, but as a world community.

"comment on white houses amazing response to westboro baptist church petitions image by cartier bracelet repliques subscribe 
one thing that seems to unite most americans is the collective disgust for the members of the westboro baptist church and their antics. many organizations and individuals have shown action in addressing this nuisance and that includes the creation of online petitions to the white house. see the five petitions  which call for the removal of westboro baptist churchs 501c3 status and legal recognition as a hate group  in the screen-capture below 
it took the white house a while to respond, but when they did, it was inspiring. in the official white response to westboro baptist church petitions , the white house explained that their options are limited. 
to the extent that these petitions request a particular law enforcement or adjudicatory action, we cannot issue a comment. in addition, as a matter of practice, the federal government doesnt maintain a list of hate groups. 
however, as is characteristic of our president and his administration, they found another way to respond to the westboro baptist church petitions  with a heartfelt message and visual. 
 one of the remarkable things about this set of petitions is that it shows just how strong the bonds that unite us can be. together, were more resilient than those who would try to drive us apart. 
the white house noted that the signers of the petitions were nationwide, but densely clustered in a couple of specific areas 
take, for instance, this map of all the signers of the petition legally recognize westboro baptist church as a hate group that we built with the zip codes that people chose to share with us when they signed. the darker color indicates a higher percentage of signers for that particular areas population. while support for these petitions came from all over the country, it was densely clustered in two places that have unique insight into the actions of the westboro baptist church  kansas, the state the church calls home, and newtown, connecticut, where the church threatened to picket the funerals of those killed at sandy hook elementary. 

the westboro baptist church makes a practice of picketing the funerals of activists, jewish leaders, gay people, soldiers, and.well, just about everyone. fred phelps,the leader of the group, is an attorney and is reputed by many sources to be a con-man who engages in controversial activities so that he can subsequently sue when officials, in their attempts to protect the rights of other people, violate the churchs rights. he is careful to not actually break the law 
the white house response is amazing and correct. the disrespect that the westboro baptist church shows our fallen soldiers serves to draw americans together in unity and respect for that which we hold sacred. 
the graves of our veterans are hallowed ground, and when men and women die in the service of their country and are laid to rest, it should be done with the utmost honor and respect.  president barack obama

donald trump promised that he would bring millions of new republicans voters into the election, but polling in swing states shows that it is hillary clinton who is getting new voters out to support her. 
within their discussion of a new pennsylvania poll showing clinton leading trump by 7 points, the new york times reported 
mrs. clinton has an 18-point lead among voters who did not participate in the 2012 election, according to our estimates, which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data. she fares even better among white voters who didnt vote in 2012 than she does among white voters who did. its a pattern that has been true across all of the upshotsiena surveys in florida, north carolina and pennsylvania. 
there has not been an influx of new voters who might help mr. trump. according to our estimates, mrs. clinton has a 16-point lead among newly registered voters. 
the idea that trump was bringing millions of new voters to the republican party was always a myth. 
donald trump got the most votes of any candidate in a republican presidential primary. trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a republican primary. trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his partys primary ballots cast against him. 
hillary clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters, and without a doubt, some of those voters have been motivated by donald trumps campaign.

"megyn kelly makes bombshell admission about trump and the media on november 13, 2016 1243 pm  
before the leaked tape of donald trump describing his propensity to grab women by the pussy to billy bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring donald trumps glaring faults as a presidential candidate. during the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. it turns out there might be a reason for that  trump was bribing the media  at least thats the accusation being made by megyn kelly of fox news. 
in her memoire settle for more, which will be released this week, kelly said that trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. that question set trump off on one of his twitter tirades. these are only a portion 
the worst and most controversial of which was this 
as the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. if they didnt, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. 
while kelly couldnt speak for other members of the media, she alleges that trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. while the attempt clearly didnt work on kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. 
this is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign i was not the only journalist to whom trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage, kelly said. he also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, this is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking. 
trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded, she said. 
when it became obvious that some reporters were in the tank for trump, she alleges in one chapter, certain tv hosts would work with the candidate in advance on occasional trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. she didnt identify them by name or media outlet. 
source yahoo 
kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which kelly asked about trumps treatment of women, the candidate called fox news exec. bill sammon, who told him about the first question. all we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was hillary clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. the insider knowledge said that a woman, in the flint, michigan debate, would ask a question about the flint water . 
while bribing journalists isnt illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. without the fourth estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.

"in only 50 years humans are close to killing off two-thirds of all wildlife we are change 
two-thirds of wild animals will vanish by 2020, largest mass extinction since dinosaurs. 
at some point the earth is going to say enough. a damning new report from the world wildlife fund has found a precipitous decline in the worlds animal populations as thousands of species scramble to survive against a sole enemy humans.
the 2016 version of wwfs biennial living planet report , published thursday, found a 58 percent overall decline in vertebrate populations from 1970 to 2012, the latest year with available data. the nonprofit warned that if current trends continue, the world could lose more than two-thirds of wildlife by 2020.
as humanity continues to demand more and more of the earth and puts pressures on our natural capital, what were seeing is the fraying of wildlife, said colby loucks , senior director for the wwfs wildlife conservation program. 
humans have affected the entire spectrum of vertebrate life ? fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, the report says. the documents warning of vanishing wildlife refers to total population size, not the number of species that will go extinct. thats an entirely different problem .

loucks linked wildlife losses to what he called the five horseman of the environmental apocalypse habitat loss, over exploitation, pollution, invasive species and climate change. those factors have undercut the 3,706 species documented by the wwf on land and in ocean and freshwater habitats.
freshwater species have been hit hardest, with populations declining 81 percent, according to the report. the freshwater biome covers less than a 0.01 percent of the planets surface, but holds about 1 in 10 known wildlife species.
theres less of the cuddly panda phenomenon going on there, because humans need water to survive, to grow crops, loucks said, noting that oftentimes we see freshwater for human use, and not for conservation. 
why are there massive die offs of different species of animals around the world ? 
humanity has expanded so much ? clear-cutting rainforests , poaching big game , overfishing the seas ? that it now requires the equivalent of 1.6 earths to provide the goods and services we use each year, the report says.
wwf ranks what it calls the ecological footprint of this consumption ? basically the amount of resources a human lifestyle requires in a defined region. rich nations, including the united states, canada and australia, have some of the biggest footprints in the world.
i dont think people really know the extent of these declines, loucks said. ultimately, were going to need collective action to try and maintain both humans and what we need, as well as the natural world.

i dont think people really know the extent of these declines, loucks said. ultimately, were going to need collective action to try and maintain both humans and what we need, as well as the natural world. 
other major endeavors this year documenting animal populations have revealed similarly shocking declines. the first full census of african elephants found a 30 percent drop across the continent in just seven years. wide swaths of australias great barrier reef have become a coral graveyard . even the loneliest frog on earth died , a symbol of the extinction crisis. 
the wwf report says theres still time to stop mass extinction. major worldwide initiatives to halt climate change and recent shifts toward renewable energy ensure we are not starting from scratch, the report says.
the facts and figures in this report tend to paint a challenging picture, yet there is still considerable room for optimism, the report reads. if we manage to carry out critically needed transitions, the rewards will be immense. 
changes should include a revamped food system that balances human need with planetary capacity.
sustainability and resilience will be achieved much faster if the majority of the earths population understand the value and needs of our increasingly fragile earth, the report says. a shared understanding of the link between humanity and nature could induce a profound change that will allow all life to thrive. 
loucks noted that such changes are really, really hard and mandate long-term thinking.
when were going to start seeing impacts more locally, your favorite lake dries up or your favorite species is no longer there, maybe at that point you start thinking longer term, he said. e ach individual is going to have their threshold when theyre going to start saying, wow, i care.

its easy to glance at tuesdays popular vote  which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows hillary clinton with six million fewer votes than barack obama won in 2012  and reach the conclusion that clinton lost the white house because she failed to turn out the democratic base. but the truth is much more complicated. while she underperformed relative to obamas 2012 totals in several midwestern states  ohio, michigan, iowa, and wisconsin  clinton ran virtually even with obama in the battlegrounds of pennsylvania, north carolina, virginia, nevada, and new hampshire. whats more, she far surpassed obamas 2012 vote total in florida, the countrys biggest swing state. yet somehow, while obama carried florida, clinton lost it. which brings us to an important question was donald trump just good enough to beat a bad democratic opponent on tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted obama machine? the answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
a review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that trump 2016 would have defeated obama 2012 in the electoral college. disclaimer this obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. still, unlike debating whether the 2016 cubs would defeat the 1927 yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the countrys most competitive states shows trump edging obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup. the math might seem impossible. after all, obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than mitt romney won. how, then, could trump have topped obama in the electoral college? the answer republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nations most critical battleground states. lets look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. the 2016 totals arent yet final because not all precincts have reported.

"misogynist donald trump is hemorrhaging evangelical women voters by hrafnkell haraldsson on thu, oct 27th, 2016 at 647 pm evangelical women support for trump stood at 58 percent in mid-october. barely above half. romney had 77 percent in 2012 share on twitter print this post 
donald trump is hemorrhaging evangelical women voters. their support for him stood at 58 percent in mid-october. barely above half. romney had 77 percent in 2012. as noted here yesterday , romney had a lot of support trump lacks. and romney lost. 
there have been rumblings among prominent evangelical women, like beth moore of living proof ministries try to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some christian leaders don't think it's that big a deal. 
 beth moore bethmoorelpm october 9, 2016 
politico asked earlier this month how long evangelical women can remain behind trump. 
that answer is in, according to the wall street journal , which says they are turning away, that the republican nominee faces vocal backlash from evangelical women over lewd comments and sexual-misconduct allegations. 
while some are willing to overlook any number of deplorable remarks from trump just to see clinton defeated, others have had enough  ""conservative christian women turn away from donald trump""  pic.twitter.com572wtqmtem

kimberly ross wrote at red state earlier this month that, 
i dont believe that i, as an american woman, am oppressed. however, it is beyond disappointing that men who not only claim faith, but are in leadership roles, are so willing to dismiss a predator among them. maybe trump has promised them some future role? i dont know. regardless, they are lured away from doing their duty and instead join in with someone whose hobby is casting females aside. im disgusted by trump and his male cheerleaders. you should be, too. thankfully, women like beth moore and rev. lisa sharon harper wont stay quiet on the sidelines as some evangelical men have always wished they would. 
she is hardly alone, and more and more evangelical women are joining the ranks of those who have heard enough misogyny from trump. the reaction of evangelical women, as laurie goodstein noted at the new york times earlier this month, be a rift that shapes politics for years. 
it isnt as if trump hasnt been saying these things all along. as david french protested at the national review back in june, trump subverts all of our most cherished values. the question is, what took them so long? 
trump has already had an effect on the religious right, an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose. he has 70 percent support from evangelical men, but while evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny, there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women.

"kellyanne conway loses it on jake tapper when he calls out trumps bigoted fans video on october 30, 2016 224 pm  
one thing that has continuously dogged the donald trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, anti-semites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. no matter how much trumps people try to say he doesnt want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. so, naturally, when trumps campaign manager kellyanne conway sat down with an interview with cnns jake tapper on sunday , that particular issue came up again. of course, conway was not happy. tapper began 
there are a lot of anti-semites and racists and misogynists who support the trump candidacy. 
conway immediately went on defense, saying, wow. tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting jew-s-a at the press pen at a recent trump rally, and directly asked conway if she would refer to such people as deplorable. she responded 
yes, i would. wow, i have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe  i hope youve been to trump rallies and i hope that youve seen the tens of thousands. i mean, hes had over half a million people easily, i think in excess of that. these are u.s.a.-loving americans. 
tapper went on to say that no, he isnt putting all trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force conways hand on this one 
but without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-semitic and racists and on and on. and these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting mr. trump. 
mr. trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-semitic fans, tapper continued. he just has. he says things like, oh, sure, i disavow, i disavow. but he has never serious said, i dont want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me. he has never seriously done it. 
conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the trump campaign is winning, saying 
i think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence i have that were actually going to win in nine days because the idea that were going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that hillary clinton would bring to the oval office in such an important week. 
no, kellyanne, its not a sign that trump is winning. its pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began that donald trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and its all because of donald trump. he embraces these bigots because hes one of them. the quicker you learn that, the better.

"wikileaks clinton confidant raised money for foundation, got bill paid gigs email 

an internal memo released wednesday by wikileaks reveals how a longtime clinton confidant played an ""unorthodox"" dual role  raising money for the clinton foundation and finding paid work for bill clinton, the hill reports. 
the 12-page document written in 2011 by doug band of teneo, a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed ""bill clinton, inc."", the washington examiner reports. 
in one instance, band secured a 540,000 donation to the clinton foundation from banking giant ubs. he later arranged for bill clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of 900,000, the hill reported. 
but in his memo, band argues his double duties were ""independent"" of one another; the memo was written after chelsea clinton criticized band's role within the family's network of interests, the hill reports. 
""in the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve, we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand bill clinton's time and engagement to best fulfill his personal, political, business, official former president, and foundationnon-profit goals,"" band writes. 
according to the hill, teneo's overlapping responsibilities worried some in the clintons' inner circle, and in one email published by wikileaks, chelsea clinton raised ""serious concerns"" with teneo's liberal use of the clinton name to court clients. 
band lashed out, calling the former first daughter a meddlesome ""spoiled brat"" in one hacked email released by wikileaks. 
""we appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the tax exempt status of the foundation,"" band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism, the hill reports. 
band co-founded teneo with former state department employee declan kelly while hillary clinton was secretary of state  and paid bill clinton as an adviser through 2012, the hill reports. 
band's memo lists several teneo clients that he and kelly ""leveraged"" into major donors for the foundation, and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the clintons and the prospective donors, the hill reports. 
one that kelly ""cultivated"" was coca-cola ceo muhtar kent, which led to seven-figure donations beginning in 2009. 
in a previous hacked email to hillary clinton campaign chairman john podesta, band worried the press might catch wind of his role and misconstrue it. 
""i'm starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed,"" band wrote. 
""kelly and i built a business. our business has almost nothing to do with the clintons, the foundation or the clinton global initiative in any way. the chairman of ubs could care a less sic about cgi."" 
a week after band sent his memo, clinton lawyer cheryl mills sent a document to podesta and band laying out ways to unwind the former president's charitable and business interests  all of which distanced band from the foundation.

"comey letter backfires as email scandal revival energizes hillary clinton supporters share on twitter print this post 
in a conference call with reporters, hillary clintons campaign manager said that fbi director comeys letter is backfiring and energizing clintons volunteers to work harder and her supporters are voting in even bigger numbers. 
clinton campaign chair john podesta called comeys letter long on innuendo, short on facts. podesta said the more information that comes out, the more this seems overblown. podesta went off on rep. jason chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened. podesta said that comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts. 
podesta said theres no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing. he said if all the media reports are true, about the investigation having nothing to do with hillary clinton, its hard to see how this amounts to anything. 
hillary clintons campaign chair called on comey to provide answers to be public. 
clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that the comey letter is motivating clinton volunteers and supporters 
based on the anecdotes i am hearing from out team on the ground, this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election. our volunteers are rallying around hillary they know what a fighter she is. 
. 
they are turning out, not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote, as early voting goes into full swing. were not just seeing this in our offices, on the ground, but also in our online, in the online space as well. i think this is; we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday. i think that this has only increased the momentum that were feeling among our activists on the ground. 
later mook suggested that the comey letter is helping the clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire. it is likely that the comey letter will backfire on republicans and motivate democrats to get out and support their nominee. 
an early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters. hillary clinton may end up benefiting from comeys actions because the fbi director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her. 
with one written paragraph, james comey may have destroyed democratic complacency.",133,736266,real

"starchitects in the city vanity fair and gentrification email 
a few weeks ago the metropolitan opera at lincoln center celebrated its 50 th anniversary. it was back on september 16, 1966 that the met opened its doors at the newly built lincoln center its previous home was a few blocks away with the premiere of samuel barbers anthony and cleopatra. recent years have seen the met in financial trouble. if the national endowment for the arts is to be believed the audience for opera is in decline- back in 2002 the percentage of american adults that see their annual opera was 3.2; by 2012 it dropped to 2.1 percent. given its gigantic 3800 seat structure the company is forced season after season to stage grand operas, i.e. operas that even occasional viewers have seen at least once, at the expense of newer smaller scale pieces. a couple of decades ago the met earned 90 percent of its potential box office revenue, a number that has dropped to 66 percent last season. prices are up to on average about 160 per head besting the average broadway ticket by over 50. the companys plan to have performances screened in movie theaters and libraries has generated some revenue but seemingly not enough. a couple of years ago the start of the opera season was almost derailed by a strike by its unionized set artists and camera operators over company calls for a pay cut. 
its an ironic fate for a grandly built structure that was billed as a cold war asset whose purpose was to elevate the cultural taste of the masses. designed by a group of then prestigious architects coordinated by wallace harrison of the firm harrison and abramovitz, who had a similar role in designing the un, lincoln centers imposing blend of classicism and modernism has few architectural defenders. missing from any promotions about the 50th anniversary gala is a reference to another musical with roots that go back to lincoln centers origin. west side story opened on broadway in 1957. by the time the jets and sharks met on the big screen in 1961, their lincoln square neighborhood was bulldozed to make way for lincoln center. the local working class population and a mosaic of small businesses, there were over 600 in the project footprint, were displaced. 
by no means was the clearing out of 48 acres for lincoln center the only such west side initiative. this was the era of robert moses and slum clearance and the west side was a prime target. further uptown the morningside heights-manhattanville neighborhoods, which like lincoln square were working class with a growing puerto rican population, saw their share of destruction and displacement, mostly to make way for new housing its residents couldnt afford. 
in the present day west side the beat goes on. recently thomas heatherwicks centerpiece design for hudson yards was unveiled. named vessel, the 150 million structure will stand 15 stories and feature 154 interconnecting staircases with 2500 climbable stairs. hudson yards, which its developers bill as the largest private real estate deal in the history of the united states the main developer is related companies, probably the biggest developer in the city, is slated to be the citys next great commercial district, a 21 st century rockefeller center, with over a dozen skyscrapers, millions of square feet of office space, and luxury housing with the requisite small percentage labeled affordable. built on 26 acres own by the mta, the public corporation that runs the citys buses and subways and the long island railroad the land has served as a storage facility for trains from nearby penn station, the neighborhood has long been in the sites of politicians and urban planners- full of truck stops and warehouses it has been almost universally declared the last undeveloped land. the ultimate vision has been to move midtowns cbd across 8 th ave into hells kitchen which, while gentrifying in recent times, still retains some of its historic working and middle class, the last such place in the middle of manhattan. the beauty of the acreage belonging to the mta is that technically as a state agency plans for their use are somewhat exempted from the normal city review process. the tragedy is as an agency whose leadership is appointed by the state and city, and is subsidized heavily by both, it isnt hard to imagine property it owns becoming, with only a bit of political maneuvering, in some way public. instead the subsidies are again flowing to a developer a 3 billion bond offering, a promise to pick up any debt service shortfall, and one to cover any over budget costs for the subway expansion to the development. by the end of 2014 the city paid out 650 million. even city officials acknowledge such subsidies will be needed until 2019. 
the backdrop to hudson yards is the high line. a much lauded 1.45 mile elevated park built on the leftover tracks from new york central railroads west side freight line, the high line draws millions of visitors a year. targeted to be torn down at several instances, its preservation was spearheaded by a grassroots effort the friends of the line now maintain and operate the park, a public-private arrangement that characterizes many of the citys parks going back to the early 1980s. the high line draws raves from planners worldwide; however absent other reform the practical effect of the high line has been to send property values soaring. it was soon surrounded by a stream of starchitect designs including norman foster, rem koulhass, and the late zara hadid. hadid, renowned for being the first female recipient of the pritzker prize, also became somewhat infamous for an august 2014 answer to an interview question about working conditions in dubai where she designed the al wakrah stadium for the 2022 world cup. when questioned about the fatal conditions for construction workers hadid coldly replied i have nothing to do with the workers. i think thats an issue the government  if theres a problem  should pick up. hopefully, these things will be resolved. while there have been no worker fatalities building 520 west 28 th , the social effect for new york can be inferred from the prices that range from just under 5 million up to 50 million per unit. 520 w 28 th by zara hadid. 
earlier this year downtown saw the opening of santiago calatravas oculus. built at the foot of the rebuilt world trade center the original version, a product of the rockefeller familys desire to rescue their real estate investments in what was then a depressed downtown, itself was a destroyer of tens of thousands of jobs along radio row, and another project that was built on land owned by a public corporation- the port authority of new york and new jersey conceived in post 911 narcissism the oculus came in a decade late it for a price tag of over 4 billion, about triple its initial cost estimate. this boondoggle of a train station will serve less than 50,000 riders a day. 
a short walk from there up broadway and one will catch sight of frank gehrys 8 spruce st with an average rent of 5500 a month. meanwhile over on the lower east side, the corner of delancy and essex streets display a close-up view of bernard tschumis blue condominium. the average sale price there is 1.5 million. a little further uptown, the american cooper buildings will soon open on first avenue. designed by shop architects, these twin towers feature a copper facade with a three story sky bridge connecting them- the bridge is equipped with a gym and 75 foot lap pool shop also designed the hideous barclays center in brooklyn for the nets-another eminent domain inspired effort. if height is your thing, billionaires row on west 57 th street features rafael viñolys 432 park avenue, currently the tallest residential building in the world. at 93 feet wide and 1396 feet tall, its 15 times as tall as wide. the penthouse went for 95 million, just below the 100.5 million penthouse sale at the christian de portzamparc designed one57 right down the street. 432 park by rafael viñoly. 
it wasnt all that long ago when architecture represented something besides extreme global inequality and cultural homogeneity. in a 2007 essay titled what happened to the social agenda, sociologist nathan glazer wrote 
modernist architects and city planners believed they could do better than the profit-inspired builders of housing for the working classes who crowded as much building as they could onto the land available. it seemed to make sense, and indeed it made some sense. 
the public housing glazer referred to here has for decades been reviled. its rational architecture came to be seen as isolating and plain. from a theoretical standpoint it was said to be given the coup de grâce by jane jacobs in her book the death and life of great american cities though this is simplistic, jacobs supported the building of the modernist west village houses, not public housing but originally part of the mitchell-lama program, a state housing program aimed at the working class. surely robert moses was more interested in slum clearance than housing the working class. that doesnt change the fact that public housing, at least at first, improved housing conditions for working poor. nor can architectures interest in the issue be denied. politically public housing was left to rot by federal withdrawal, poor often racist placement, subsidized suburbs, and ideology. st louis was the first city to demolish its public housing the pruitt igoe complex was dynamited live on tv in 1972. by the time the destruction came pruitt igoe was so run down its occupancy was less than 35 percent. more recently chicago took its turn. however in new york, for all its flaws and debt, public housing is functioning well enough to have a waiting list. the decline of public housing in most cities was a failure of politics; still architecture also took the blame. 
for modernisms failures real and perceived, glazer wrote of architects 
the architect could then conclude that if modernism could do nothing for social problems, if the expectations of architectural determinism were naïve, why bother let us devote ourselves to architecture alone- to building design and form -instead of to architecture and city planning 
in other words status quo, political neutral buildings that reflect the excess of the global elite while demonstrating no purpose beyond their own genius. it goes without saying that architects cant determine city planning policy on their own, yet there is no reason, given the housing crisis ravaging many cities, for the profession not to push the envelope in a more inclusive direction. and there is no inherent reason such a movement would have to return to the bland bricks of modernisms housing projects. earlier this year 2016 pritzker prize winner, chilean architect alejandro aravena , posted a number of his designs for low-cost housing for free on his firm elementals webpage. in an interview with dezeen, aravena said of architects and social housing but the constraints are not just budget constraints  the building logic, the political framework, and the policies, are part of the equation and were not well trained for that. were never taught the right thing at university. 
one can only hope that changes. architects can be valuable allies to progressive city planning. for that to happen though the word starchitect would have to take on different, and grander, meaning.",39,736265,fake

"clinton suggested us should rig a foreign election  but don't expect the media to care - danielle ryan citizen journalism with a punch clinton suggested us should rig a foreign election  but don't expect the media to care originally appeared at rt 
hillary clinton has spent a disproportionate amount of time lately complaining  without evidence  about the russians interfering with the us election. but it turns out that interfering in foreign elections is totally fine if youre the united states. 
clinton has used this notion of russian interference as a non-stop talking point throughout her campaign. any and all scandals she has faced have been blamed on moscow, and she has used alleged russian involvement as a convenient distraction. her supporters have enthusiastically adopted the talking point. in light of the fbis decision to reopen the investigation into her use of a private email server, one congressman actually suggested that russia may be behind the fbis decision. yes, russia has now infiltrated the fbi, which is working with vladimir putin to elect trump and destroy hillary. its all a massive conspiracy. 
so, you would think given her apparent distaste for other countries supposedly meddling in the american electoral process, that clinton wouldnt have been caught on tape suggesting very candidly to a group of journalists that the us should have rigged a foreign election. 
but she was. the tape is from a 2006 meeting clinton held with the editorial board of the jewish press when she was running for re-election as senator for new york. here is the quote in full, so there can be no accusations of taking it out of context 
i do not think we should have pushed for an election in the palestinian territories. i think that was a big mistake  and if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. 
thats right. clinton suggested the us should have made sure the outcome of a palestinian election went in its favor. she was referring to the 2006 election for the second palestinian legislative council, which saw the us-favored fatah lose to hamas 45 seats to 74 seats. 
this is one of those stories that will be largely ignored or played down by the american media, which favor hillary clinton over donald trump, and see it as their duty to get her elected. if trump had made the same remarks, we would never hear the end of it. no doubt, some will try to water down the comment and imply that clinton didnt really mean what she said. but there is frankly no other way to interpret her words. this is hillary clinton casually suggesting that the us should have rigged a foreign election in its favor. 
how else can you determine the outcome of an election before it happens? how else can you be sure who is going to win in advance? all the polling data in the world could end up being wrong  so unless you do something unsavory to fully ensure the outcome, then theres no way you can be sure of anything. but dont hold your breath waiting for journalists to push clinton on what exactly she had in mind when she said the us should have done something about it. 
eli chomsky, the journalist that released the tape, told the observer that in the 2006 meeting with clinton, he was surprised that anyone could support the idea  offered by a national political leader, no less  that the us should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. chomskys bosses at the jewish press at the time felt the comments were not newsworthy, and so they werent published. in reality, he admitted, they simply didnt want to offend clinton should they need her down the road. convinced it was in fact newsworthy, chomsky held on to the tape for 10 years. 
clintons casual suggestion to influence an election in the us favor takes on more significance in light of the revelations that her campaign was working with the neutral democratic national committee dnc to ensure she won the presidential nomination over bernie sanders. 
strangely enough, as the observer also noted, in answering a question about the us talking to its enemies, the clinton of 2006 sounded more like the donald trump of 2016. asked if it was worth talking to syria, she said that she didnt see how it could hurt to talk to your adversaries, citing the fact that the us and the soviet union never stopped talking to each other. she continued but if you say, theyre evil, were good, and were never dealing with them, i think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them 
this is particularly odd because clinton in recent years has been one of the biggest cheerleaders of the russia is evil and america is good ideology. but again, dont expect clinton to be questioned rigorously on any of this. american journalists only have 10 days left to get her elected. theyre not going to bother worrying about irrelevancies like the fact that shes evidently totally fine with foreign election rigging. 
you really couldnt make this stuff up. clinton spends months pretending to be outraged over russia interfering in the us election with no solid evidence, and then audio emerges of her unequivocally suggesting washington should have rigged a palestinian election. the level of hypocrisy and irony here is hard to fathom. 
no doubt, one person who will enthusiastically pick the story up is clintons opponent donald trump, who has been suggesting for months that she will somehow manage to rig the presidential election against him. 
clinton herself will probably find a way to pin the release of the tape on the russians.",157,736268,fake

her stand on the issues are as follows
affordable care act unlike many politicians, she does not believe that repealing the aca would be effective unless there is a program in place to take its place. the choices are repeal or repair. perry has a four-part plan to improve what she calls a monstrosity of legislation to make it affordable, sustainable, and provide quality healthcare. education this is a huge issue for nevada. the failing schools have proved that the department of education is not effective as a governing body. it is vital to rid the educational system of big government and return the power to local entities. each state would then be empowered to tailor their program to fit the needs of their student body. energy dependence on foreign oil must end. there are many ways to achieve this. we could completely end our dependency on oil by using compressed natural gas to run automobiles, heat our homes, etc.

"clinton, comey and the e-mail scandal is there a rebellion at the fbi? home  politics  clinton, comey and the e-mail scandal is there a rebellion at the fbi? clinton, comey and the e-mail scandal is there a rebellion at the fbi? 0 shares 
103116 the clintons are a crime family and hillary a pathological liar, said former assistant fbi director james kallstrom during an interview sunday. and it appears his belief is shared by current rank-and-file fbi agents, as a rebellion has apparently been brewing within the bureau. 
the latest shocking news on this front is that despite a plea deal to destroy laptops evidence belonging to clinton associates, those devices were not destroyed and are still in the possession of the fbi. as the daily caller reports  
washington d.c. attorney joe digenova said on the david webb show on siriusxm friday night that despite the fbi agreeing to destroy the laptops of clinton aide cheryl mills and ex-campaign staffer heather samuelson as part of immunity deals made during the initial investigation of clintons email server, agents involved in the case refused to destroy the laptops. 
according to the agreement reached with the attorneys who handed over their laptops, the laptops were to be destroyed per the agreement after the testimony was given  the interviews were given  by the attorneys. the bureau and the department agreed to that, digenova said. however the laptops contrary to published reports were not destroyed and the reason is the agents who are tasked with destroying them refused to do so. and by the way the laptops are at the fbi for inspection by congress or federal courts. 
digenova said the laptops have already been subpoenaed and the fbi is waiting for congress to ask for them. 
as to this reports credibility, american thinkers thomas lifson notes that digenova, a former us attorney and washington, dc superlawyer is no flake. he has plenty of contacts within the fbi and a reputation to protect. so i take his words on siriusxms david webb show quite seriously. 
ever since fbi director james comey shown above shook the political world friday by announcing that the bureau was reopening the investigation into clintons illegal use of a private e-mail server, theories as to why hes acting now have proliferated. after all, since consensus was that comey was covering for the democrats at the obama administrations behest, no one expected a revisiting of clintons criminality just over a week before the election. 
of course, given that tens of thousands of e-mails  some apparently clinton related  were recovered from ex-congressman anthony wieners laptop during an investigation into his having sent illicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl, the most obvious explanation is that of watergate journalist carl bernstein , that whatever was found is a real bombshell. as thomas lifson wrote in 3 competing theories on why the fbi re-opened the hillary email server investigation, it is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would, sic be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election. in this scenario, comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed, and that he would be held accountable after it comes out. this scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis, involving the possible indictment of a president-elect before an election. or the evidence being turned over to the house of representatives for impeachment hearings. 
the second theory lifson outlined was one put forth by radio host rush limbaugh. as lifson wrote, by announcing an fbi investigation resuming, comey is putting a lid on further attention to wikileaks. i guess this means that clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete after the election before speaking about what the evil russians are planting into our politics. 
lastly, lifson wrote that comey might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation, recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the fbi is substantial. three days ago, american thinker published an open letter from a retired fbi agent, hugh galyean, that laid out some of the damage comey has inflicted on the institution he leads. there is little doubt that this reached many in the fbi family, putting in print what people have only whispered about. if those silenced voices start speaking out, comey could face a serious loss of face. in this scenario, he is heading off a staff rebellion, possibly including mass resignations. 
this last theory is lent great credence by the news that the plea-deal laptops were never destroyed. if that story is true, it reflects a rebellion more serious than most anyone had imagined  with agents defying a direct order . this also adds weight to a related theory that agents are so disgruntled that not only could some resign and reveal, but that active personnel could actually leak the truth to the media. if this is the case, comey might be trying to get out ahead of such a development. post navigation",78,736268,fake

we are witnessing the end of the neoliberal era, said dr. cornel west , the nations most prominent black public intellectual, assessing the import of last weeks election. west backed bernie sanders in the democratic primaries, then endorsed the green partys presidential ticket. the election did not go left-populist, following bernie sanders and jill stein, he said. instead, it went rightwing-fascist. but the neoliberal era is coming to a close and the neoliberal establishment is being exposed. the issues of class now are becoming much more central. trump supporters mounted an insurrection 
duboisian scholar dr. anthony monteiro was among the few observers on the left that thought donald trump would win at the polls. but, even he was startled at the scope of trumps sweep. i felt that the insurgency would grow and deepen, but i never thought that it would become an insurrection, said monteiro. in a certain sense, white working and poor people in these small, rust belt towns have a sense of achievement in having brought the clintons down that black people had in 2008 when barack obama was elected with a huge black turnout, he said. monteiro is one of the organizers of a conference on political science for radical times, set for december 9-10, in philadelphia. tpp on its death bed 
with donald trumps victory, president obamas trans pacific partnership corporate rights trade deal is looking like its on its death bed, said kevin zeese , of popular resistance. weve worked for five years to make tpp stand for toxic political poison, and that seems to have happened, said zeese. trump won in the rust belt that was destroyed by nafta -- bill clintons jobs-exporting bill of a generation ago -- and was going to be threatened again by tpp. zeese said obama may make a last bid to pass tpp in the lame duck session of congress that begins this week. finally, a practical guide to black self-determination 
the black is back coalition for social justice, peace and reparations adopted a 19-point black political agenda for self-determination, at a conference in washington. the document applies the principle of self-determination to the broadest range of issues, from black community control of the police, to mass black incarceration, to nationalization of the banks. everybody wants self-determination, said coalition chairman omali yeshitela , but what does it mean, practically? the 19 points give direction to the struggle. this isnt something you work on every four years, said yeshitela. this is something you work on every day. this is our program. 
margaret kimberley , an editor and senior columnist for black agenda report, told the conference when we meet together, today, we are showing the world what self-determination looks like. voting for your enemies is not self-determination, and thinking that electoral politics is the only road to liberation is not self-determination, said kimberley. black agenda radio on the progressive radio network is hosted by glen ford and nellie bailey. a new edition of the program airs every monday at 1100am et on prn. length one hour.",25,736283,fake

as predicted, donald trumps victory on election day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities. 
and its even happening in the deep blue state of california, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of pittsburg and snapped a photo of it.

the sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent african-americans from getting equal rights. 
you can hang a nr from a tree  equal rights he will never see! it says. 
the fbi has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it. 
in the wake of trumps surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. in fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by trump supporters since the election night results. 
these incidents include the harassment of a muslim teacher by a student in georgia, and students designating water fountains white or colored at a florida high school. 
frankly, there are so many incidents that its difficult to list them all. you can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here . 
this is what trumps america looks like and its scary. and this has all happend in the course of a few days as melania trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. what exactly does she mean by that? is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husbands own supporters? or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband. because right now, she isnt even first lady yet and her effort has failed miserably. and she only has her husband to blame.",6,736281,real

as election day draws closer and closer, it becomes even harder to understand or tolerate donald trump supporters. it is conceptually difficult for many of us to understand how anyone could support trump knowing all we know about him. but many people dont know what we know, so heres a viral list that every trump supporter needs to read before they vote on tuesday, courtesy of some anonymous facebook poster. 
so you want someone to tell it like it is? ok, here you go. 1. you join a lying machine and call hillary crooked. but you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. you support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. you support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. just like we now know putins puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. a corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with putins girlfriend. making russia great again? a con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. you say you love our veterans but support a man who believes pows are not heroes because they were captured? a man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. a man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to afghanistan. a man who insults and derides our generals. 3. you think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. a man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after orlando mass shooting  when dwyane wades cousin nykea aldridge was killed. as 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 911 attacks were good for him  bragged about how his building is now the tallest in manhattan just hours after the attack. when the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit eu, he boasted about making money off british economic uncertainty. when the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of americans lost their homes, he said  i sort of hope real estate market tanks. trump is always looking out for trump. how do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? he is not even a good person. 4. you say youre patriotic  love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitutions limits  has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. a careless small man who asked russia to spy on our former secretary of state. a man who trash talks our nato allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like saddam hussein, kim jong un, muammar gaddafi, vladimir putinetc 5. you support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. a man who was accused of raping his wife  has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire jeffrey epstein. a man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. then you turn around and bring up bill clintons history with women? i agree with you 100 bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. may i remind you bill is not running to be the next president. if you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you cant ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. you support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? a man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. yes, hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. you call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? every time trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. fact checkers have proven it over and over again. we are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in new jersey on 911. the man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional. 
8. you support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects  exploited our visa program. he is a man capable of solving our immigration problem? 9. i agree 100 if shes elected hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the clinton foundation. let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. with that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the clinton foundation. the irs found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to florida attorney general pam bondi. just after 4 days of the bribe payment pam dropped trump u case. he also held 150k fundraiser for pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. his foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave 10,000.00 to the giving back fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. a man who completely retooled his charity to spend other peoples money. a man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. you claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in bangladesh, china, honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? you claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home? 11. you claim the unfit, unstable putins little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-rights anti-muslim and anti-immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country? 12. you support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it, and has shown he is prejudice with his actions  words over and over again. then he pretends he cares about the black communities. he brings up hillarys reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as super-predators in 1996? i dont agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. something trump refuses to do. of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics  tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you dont care what he says or does. you are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.",125,736273,fake
"i dont rent to n s smoking gun proves trump family racism video  addicting info  the knowledge you crave on october 25, 2016 1041 pm  
new video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, fred trump, young donald trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
as part of an investigation by nbc news, stanley leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the trump organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
in the interview, leibowitz said that trump told him i dont rent to the n-word, and indicates that trump made this statement with donald trump in the room and that the younger trump affirmed the policy. 
the revelation comes at the same time that the clinton campaign has released a video highlighting trumps run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
undercover investigators were sent to trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. the white applicants were allowed into the trump properties. 
one bit of testimony determined that trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a c on the documents for colored, and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
the trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
donald trumps involvement with his fathers business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his fathers 14 million dollars that he gave to trump to start his business. but if you accept that, the trump organizations history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how trump may try to wave it away  its still there.

"desperate obama rips comey 'we don't operate on innuendo'  daily wire desperate obama rips comey 'we don't operate on innuendo' by november 2, 2016 
barack obama must be pretty worried. 
earlier this week, white house press secretary josh earnest told the media that fbi director james comeys decision to reopen an investigation into hillary clinton didnt spring from bias or politics. he explained  
director comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the fbi was considered by the united states senate... they speak to his good character and the president's assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed. for example, the president doesn't believe that director comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election. and the president doesn't believe he's secretly supporting a candidate or political party. he's in a tough spot. he's the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties. 
now, with the polls closing to within the margin of error, president obama has had second thoughts. he told nowthisnews  
i do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks. we operate based on concrete decisions that are made. when this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the fbi, the conclusion of the justice department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable. 
its worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here  obamas entire administration has been built on innuendo. his department of justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism. his irs used innuendo to destroy conservative 501c3s. his entire 2012 campaign was rooted in innuendo about mitt romneys supposed secret evils. 
but more than anything, the obama flip here shows serious desperation. what changed? the polls. on monday, it looked like the fbi scandal would detract from hillarys polling numbers, but wouldnt kill her. now it looks like she might go down in flames. this shows how faithless obama is  comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened hillarys chances, at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo. 
if comey has any stones, he should resign in protest at obamas accusations. hes already been thrown under the bus by his commander-in-chief for not playing dead for him long enough to move hillary into the white house. hes got no future in his position no matter what he does. it would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell obama and his cronies to stuff it now. tags",43,736270,real

uh-oh. 
according to bret baier of fox news, the fbi has been investigating the clinton foundation for over a year, and that investigation has been deep and wide  and just as importantly, the fbi is on the verge of indictment for pay-for-play with regard to hillarys state department. the fbi investigation has uncovered laptops from clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed. 
and most importantly of all , the sources at the fbi have apparently told baier with 99 percent accuracy that hillarys server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and information was withdrawn. 
meanwhile, we now know that the department of justice attempted to pressure the fbi into shutting down the investigation into the clinton foundation entirely. according to the wall street journal , the fbi deputy director even asked the doj if they truly wanted to shut down a validly predicated investigation. 
this is devastating information for hillary. 
donald trump is now leading in florida, ohio, nevada, iowa, and north carolina. trump is within spitting distance in colorado and pennsylvania, and two new polls show trump up in virginia and new hampshire, respectively. if trump picks off any of those latter states, he wins the election. 
the best case scenario for hillary clinton just days ago was simple hunker down and wait out these scandals. assume that as time goes on, the race will revert back to its pre-comey normal, with hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead. but each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the clinton foundation and state department. each new day demonstrates the extent of the cover-up by the obama administration.

reids full letter follows 
dear director comey 
your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act, which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election. through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
the double standard established by your actions is clear. 
in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump, his top advisors, and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states, which trump praises at every opportunity. the public has a right to know this information. i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. there is no danger to american interests from releasing it. and yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. 
by contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. 
moreover, in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department. you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton. 
as you know, a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march 10, 2016, makes clear that all justice department employees, including you, are subject to the hatch act. the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the hatch act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. 
the clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. 
please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past. when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant. 
with the deepest regret, i now see that i was wrong.

"fbi horrified as spy says russia has been supporting and cultivating trump for years by sarah jones on tue, nov 1st, 2016 at 1148 am a ""veteran"" spy is alleging that russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years. the spy said the response from the fbi was ""shock and horror."" share on twitter print this post 
a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years. the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror. 
the report alleges that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin and that russian intelligence claims to have compromised trump on his visits and could blackmail him. 
david corn at mother jones reported 
mother jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. the first memo, based on the former intelligence officers conversations with russian sources, noted, russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting trump for at least 5 years. aim, endorsed by putin, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance. it maintained that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals. it claimed that russian intelligence had compromised trump during his visits to moscow and could blackmail him. it also reported that russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on hillary clinton based on bugged conversations she had on various visits to russia and intercepted phone calls. 
the former intelligence officer says the response from the fbi was shock and horror. the fbi, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his american associates. yet in august, they say, the fbi asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. the former spy forwarded to the bureau several memossome of which referred to members of trumps inner circle. after that point, he continued to share information with the fbi. its quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on, he says. 
in august, corn reports, the fbi asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he continued to share information with the fbi which he says made it clear there was a pretty substantial inquiry going on. 
if this report is accurate, the spys information confirms what senator harry reid says intelligence experts and fbi director james comey already shared with him regarding explosive information regarding ties and coordination between donald trump and russia. 
this report also rings true given report about the trump server repeatedly being connected to russia, including trumps server possibly communicating with a russian bank. 
it also makes sense given the many ties to russia within trumps own campaign and indeed trumps own rhetoric regarding nato and russia. trump changed the republican party platforms pro-ukraine proposals and talked about weakening nato, both of which mirrored putins wish list. nbc reported monday evening that the fbi is in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps ex-campaign managers connection to russia. 
donald trump has already been busted for reading russian propaganda at his rallies, as newsweeks kurt eichenwald uncovered an instance of trump reading propaganda directly from putin at a rally in pennsylvania. 
eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the russians have been hacking into american emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election, the russians have been obtaining american emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of themfalsifying themin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election. the big question, of course, is why are the russians working so hard to damage clinton and, in the process, aid donald trump? 
the answer to why putin is trying so hard to defeat clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her. unlike donald trump, hillary clinton is no pushover. according to former u.s. officials, putin sees clinton as a forceful proponent of regime change policies that the russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival. 
trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the kremlin. hes been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy, he is easily flattered and easily manipulated. its also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him  see the billy bush bus tape of trump bragging about sexual assault. trump is easy bait. 
the fact that the fbi director felt compelled to announce something about hillarys emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aides emails and even then he wasnt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates, but he chose to keep this explosive information about donald trumps ties to russia under wraps is very disturbing. 
this isnt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the fbi follows about ongoing investigations. this is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate. but the fact that they come from different sources and that trump willingly staffed his own campaign with russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak  these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions.",133,736269,real
"email pandemonium and the perpetuation of rape culture by robert franek on sun, oct 30th, 2016 at 901 am imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails. this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety, security, and well-being. share on twitter print this post 
the following post, written by the rev. robert a. franek, is a part of politicus policy discussion, in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy. 
even after months and months of coverage blown out of proportion and at great expense to the public in dollars, psychic stress, and issue coverage ,it seems all one has to do is put hillary clinton and emails together in the same sentence with claims of lying and threatening national security and pandemonium continues to break loose throughout the mass media and social media worlds. and yet despite multiple investigations and repeated explanations the pandemonium persists, so much so that every time republicans stir up some smoke the media assumes there must be a blazing fire. and sadly this is not going away anytime soon, as republicans are promising more sham investigations in lieu of actually governing as sarah jones reported. 
republicans are already planning how to avoid being grown ups who do their jobs if hillary clinton is elected president. yes, there will be more toy-throwing and tantrums and best of all for the party of fiscal humiliations, more wasteful spending on political witch hunts.  sarah jones 
meanwhile, women continue to come forward with painful, heartbreaking stories of donald trumps sexual harassment and assault. yet, instead of being portrayed as survivors who have finally had enough of the republican presidential nominee and his lies and as women who have the strength and courage to go public with their stories, they are being made into opportunistic victims and challenged for not coming forward sooner much sooner. woefully, no mention is made of the many intersecting reasons that lead many women and men not to report these crimes, including that this is the only time when the victim is placed on trial. 
after walking her readers through one incident of donald trumps public sexual humiliation of a woman for revenge , sarah jones makes the following observation 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault. its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. 
she is right. donald trump is despicable. still, there is cultural culpability in the perpetuation of rape culture where women are treated as objects, forced into silence, and placed on trial for their assailants crimes. 
this must change. 
it is unacceptable in a country that places such a high value on freedom that so many are not free from sexual harassment, assault, exploitation, and humiliation. more it is appalling that such behavior is often cheered, unchallenged, and dismissed. it is also inexcusable that survivors face unparalleled levels of scrutiny when they do finally come forward. 
it is also beyond tragic that people of faith who read the first chapter of genesis cant bear out the implications of men and women being created simultaneously and bearing equally the divine image. 
supposed christian values champion and republican vice presidential nominee, mike pence is more upset over an article he didnt read regarding voter suppression efforts by the trump campaign than any of the horrifying things donald trump has said including bragging about sexual assault. 
these are not christian values nor are they values any civil society should hold. failing to call out donald trumps abhorrent behavior and speech is beyond deplorable. additionally, supporting candidates like donald trump and mike pence gives validity to their wretched views and is especially shocking when done by people of faith and family values. 
as a society, we must challenge the pervasive and systemic sexism and misogyny that persists in our culture. as much as we need changes in our laws and lawmakers! at every level of government to reflect the equality and humanity of women, we need a moral revival in our collective conscience as a nation that decries every facet of rape culture from how we raise our children to the victim blaming and shaming that happens each time a survivor goes public with their story. 
imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails. this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety, security, and well-being.

"big pharma targets profits in rare diseases big pharma targets profits in rare diseases all of the world's most expensive drugs are used to treat uncommon conditions image credits stocksnappixabay . 
one might think big pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more well-known diseases, but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next big thing in rare diseases. 
big pharmas profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases, simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments. 
the search for the next money-maker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments, which may explain why they still havent discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the worlds population. 
in 1983, the orphan drug act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs werent as profitable. 
because of the incentives, which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees, over 500 new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced. 
for common illnesses, big pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug. for example, liptior atorvastatin, which is used to regulate cholesterol, generates a sales profit of 131 billion with the prescription only costing patients around 2 per day. 
but with rare diseases, prices must be kept high in order to keep big pharma in business. this means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures, their pocketbooks are in for a hit. 
for example, the cystic fibrosis drug kalydeco by vertex costs individual patients 311,000. 
gileads sovaldi, used to treat hepatitis c, cashes in at 84,000 for a paltry 12-week course of medication. 
and soliris, used to treat rare blood conditions, costs the patient a whopping 400,000 per year. 
the list of the 10 most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat orphan or uncommon illnesses. 
thanks to these laws that allow big pharma to charge these insane amounts of money, they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows. 
drugs for rare diseases will account for 19 of pharmaceutical branded drug profits by the year 2020. newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew. related articles",92,736265,fake

  ethan a. huff, staff writer tags smoking age , california , prohibition naturalnews if you're between the ages of 18 and 21, live in california and are a smoker, expect to be denied your favorite pack at the convenience store. beginning in june, the new minimum age for officially jumped from 18 to 21, a prohibition move that lawmakers claim will curb the number of smokers in the golden state, and ultimately help save lives.joining both hawaii and the city of needham in massachusetts, california is the third locale in the u.s. to raise the legal smoking age to 21. officials there hope that, like in these other places, age restrictions on smoking will help reduce the number of smokers and minimize the number of individuals who develop smoking-related health conditions like emphysema and lung cancer.citing statistics from needham that show a nearly 50 percent reduction in the number of smokers in the five-year period following the change that was made in 2005, april roeseler, head of the california public health department's tobacco control program, told the los angeles times that she expects similar reductions in her state.in needham, the number of high schoolers smoking cigarettes fell by nearly half, according to a study published last year. and adult smoking rates in the town also fell from about 18.1 percent to a mere 8 percent  statistics that experts say can be replicated all across the country.""if we can push that age up where fewer and fewer people start smoking as a teen, it's likely that we will start to have some tobacco-free generations ,"" the times quotes her as saying. prohibition never works; people who want 'contraband' will find a way at this point, though, very little, if any, evidence exists to show that the rule change is working as intended. university of california, san francisco ucsf professor dr. stanton glantz, for instance, admitted to the times that the policy still needs time to ""settle in."" the california smokers' helpline also says it hasn't noticed any increases in the number of callers in the prohibited age range trying to quit, which suggests that not much has changed.there's also the contraband factor  older kids still buying cigarettes for younger kids, for example, including those younger than the former threshold age of 18. illegal buying has always been an issue, law or no law, which is something that the government never really seems to understand when it comes to issues of prohibition .""they're hanging out and partying together, so they'll just get someone else to buy,"" says leonard charles, the owner of a liquor store in oakland. charles says he strictly enforces the new cigarette age law, but believes that if somebody wants cigarettes, he or she is going to find a way, regardless of the law.in the internet age, cigarettes are also freely available to anybody with a wifi connection. people can order cigarettes off the web and have them delivered right to their doorstep, which means that state-level restrictions are basically moot.and what about e-cigarettes? the state of california classifies e-cigs as a ""tobacco product"" just like cigarettes, and they are subject to the same laws. however, everybody has them these days, they're very discreet, and they don't produce that typical tobacco smell that's so hard to get out of a room , so trying to enforce restrictions against their use is next to impossible, say experts familiar with the reality of how easy it is to obtain tobacco, regardless of what the law says.when asked how the new law will realistically work in light of the fact that smoking laws often aren't effective, glantz responded, ""the short answer is i don't know."" sources for this article include",117,736264,fake

"лучшие друзья дональда трампа политика 
ни у кого не обнаруживается столько друзей, сколько у свежеиспечённого президента после оглашения результатов выборов  разве что у бедняка после выигрыша в лотерею нескольких миллионов долларов. внезапно оказалось, что практически все российские звезды  добрые знакомые дональда трампа. а чтобы никому не пришло в голову усомниться, многие поспешили предъявить, так сказать, вещественные доказательства совместные фотографии с 45-м президентом сша, правда, сделанные ещё тогда, когда он о президентстве и не задумывался. 
фото с трампом уже продемонстрировали филипп киркоров, ани лорак, кэти топурия, игорь николаев, оксана фёдорова, эмин, а владимир винокур разместил в инстаграме снимки и с трампом, и с путиным, да ещё подписал их мы победили!, заставляя задуматься а всё ли мы знаем о большой политике и роли в ней винокура? 
некоторые представительницы российского шоу-бизнеса отметились в жанре короткого рассказа на тему дональд трамп в моей жизни. тина канделаки поведала миру, что её дочь получила не самое распространённое в россии имя мелания в честь супруги трампа, которую она лично не знала, но зато видела по телевизору в качестве ведущей конкурса красоты. не упустила шанс напомнить о своих достижениях и елена кулецкая, больше всего известная как бывшая невеста димы билана. оказывается, она брала у трампа интервью и довела миллиардера до такой степени откровенности, что он заговорил о той части своего тела, которую люди его уровня редко показывают публично  о ногах. 
даже те персонажи, которые трампа в глаза не видели, сумели вписаться в актуальный, так сказать, тренд. таисия повалий разместила своё фото в казино, да не в каком-нибудь, а в принадлежащем трампу остальное предлагается дофантазировать читателям. но всех переплюнул стриптизёр и муж наташи королевой сергей глушко, более известный как тарзан он поместил в инстаграм своё фото в белом махровом халате, украшенном логотипом одного из отелей свежеизбранного президента сша. дескать, лично не знаком  но хоть так причастен. 
при виде этого парада тщеславия невольно вспоминается персонаж, который после рукопожатия знаменитости неделю не моет руку. вот только в роли такого восторженного простака выступили сами звезды. поскольку наивные люди в шоу-бизнесе не выживают, то, похоже, демонстрация дружеских чувств призвана подкрепить радужные планы авось победитель на праздничный концерт пригласит или новое интервью даст. если вспомнит, конечно. а не вспомнит  так лишний пиар ещё никому не повредил.",67,736279,fake

""скандал разгорелся в середине сентября, когда издание ""наши гроши"" обнаружило целое жилое здание семь квартир и одно нежилое помещение в центре киева на улице эспланадной, которым владела гражданка по фамилии светлана рыженко"",  написал лещенко в своем блоге на сайте ""украинской правды"" . 
она оказалась бухгалтером в фирме ирины луценко. 
затем все у того же сельского бухгалтера обнаружилась еще одна недвижимость  квартира в ялте общей площадью в 145 метров, которую все местные так и называют ""квартирой луценко"".ее не так давно выставили на продажу за 1 миллион долларов, отметил лещенко. 
""однако, кроме дома в киеве, у бухгалтера луценко из села оказалась еще одна недвижимость  в крыму. это квартира вялте площадью 145 метров, которая недавно была выставлена на продажу за 1 млн долларов"",  отметил лещенко. 
""другими словами, луценко, всю жизнь работавший на госслужбе, оформил на подставных лиц огромных размеров дорогостоящую недвижимость, не имея подтвержденных для этого легальных доходов"",  заявил лещенко. 
по словам депутата, луценко продал недвижимость в киеве депутату от блока порошенко глебу загорию после развязавшегося скандала. 
напомним, как сообщала правда. ру, генпрокурором украины юрий луценко стал в мае 2016 года, сменив на этом посту ставшего неугодным экс-генпрокурора виктора шокина, на отставке которого настаивали американские кураторы украинской власти. 
представил к назначению луценко лично петр порошенко . при этом президенту украины даже пришлось внести некоторые законодательные изменения порошенко подписал закон о генпрокуратуре, согласно которому ведомство может возглавить человек без юридического образования. в том, что эти изменения писались исключительно под кандидатуру нового генпрокурора, сомневаться не приходится. 
несмотря на то, что луценко не имеет профильного образования, он целых два раза успел возглавить мвд украины. есть в его биографии и другие ""полезные"" для занимаемой должности факты. к примеру, в 2010 году луценко был арестован, а через два года  и осужден на 4 года по делу о растрате государственных средств в особо крупных размерах. в 2013 году виктор янукович своим президентским указом помиловал ряд осужденных, среди которых оказался и луценко. 
спустя еще год в судебном порядке с будущего генпрокурора были сняты все обвинения, а сам он признан ""политически пострадавшим"" от репрессий прежнего руководства страны.

"trump kills the gop with the lowest score in history of presidential leadership poll in a major omen of potential election disaster for republicans, donald trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of gallups presidential leadership poll. 
gallup released their presidential leadership survey, and the results were historically bad for donald trump 
voters rate trump worse than any other presidential candidate in gallups records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have. previous readings were taken in late october in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 campaigns. in those years, between 52 and 61 of registered voters said the two major-party candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities  a sharp contrast to trumps current 32. clintons rating of 51 is one percentage point below the previous low score. 
clintons score, while low, was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to 2000. trumps score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll. 
voters arent going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership. the popular vote total in 2016 may reflect the nations political polarization, but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the democratic candidate.

im sorry, kate. i just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this, baldwin says. i just feel gross all the time about this. dont you all feel gross? he added, addressing the audience. 
mckinnon agrees and the two embark on a friendship montage through the city before returning to the stage. then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. none of this would have mattered if you dont vote, baldwin says.

"prescription drugs time to just say no by alliance for natural health  usa 
theyre dangerous, even deadly, but hugely profitable. big pharma has bought politicians and doctors. only the american public can stop it by refusing the product. action alert! 
most people are understandably afraid to say no. they dont know enough about medicine. we understand. we arent doctors and never offer medical advice. but the internet has put most medical research at your doorstep, including information about drug side effects and risks. and there are integrative doctors who can offer sound advice on the subject. 
are we as a society addicted to legal drugs? are we also wasting huge amounts of money on substances that all too often offer more harm than benefit? lets consider these numbers 60 of americans take one or more prescription drugs. 15 of americans take five or more prescription drugs. some, many more. there are no studies on the interaction of all these drugs. 10 of americans take an antidepressant medication; for women in their 40s and 50s, its 25. 25 of americans over the age of 45 take a statin drug, despite much evidence of harm , including promoting diabetes. doctors write about 6 million prescriptions for proton-pump inhibitors a class of acid blocking drugs each year, making these drugs the third highest selling class of drugs on the market. this is happening although logic and evidence suggest that most people, especially older people, suffer from too little stomach acid , not too much. 
statins and acid blockers only begin to describe the problems. 
a recent study found that elderly patients were able to reduce their risk of death by 38. how? by  de-prescribing reducing the number of prescription drugs they were taking. 
properly prescribed prescription drugs are the fourth leading cause of death in the country; they cause an estimated 1.9 million hospitalizations a year and 128,000 deaths. another 840,000 hospitalized patients are given drugs that cause serious adverse reactions. these are just hospital numbers. and even in hospitals, there is reason to believe that most of the injury from drugs is hard to isolate and therefore not reported. 
even if a drug does not kill or hospitalize us, there can still be serious side effects. one study found that adverse drug effects reported to the fda more than doubled in the last decadeand these figures are based on voluntary reports. some researchers estimate that fewer than 10 of adverse events are actually reported . 
another risk to taking prescription drugs they often deplete the body of nutrients. this is a serious issue. last week , we reported that the us department of agriculture estimates that 90 of the american public is deficient in at least one nutrient; it is common to be severely deficient in many. magnesium is an essential co-factor with more than 300 different enzymes regulating different processes throughout the body. if magnesium is scarce, it may be routed to the heart, where it is especially needed, and other parts of the body suffer over time. or it may even be inadequate in the heart. 
another example is vitamin d. a number of drugs can interfere with the bodys absorption of vitamin d, including antacids, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals aids drugs, and some antibiotics. a meta-analysis found that those with what conventional medicine considers low vitamin d in the blood and integrative doctors consider very low lower than 30 ngml were twice as likely to die prematurely from all causes. as much as two-thirds of the us population may be below that level david williams, alternatives newsletter , september 2014. 
the list goes on. cox-2 inhibitor drugs, which include some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory nsaid drugs ibuprofen, aspirin, reduce vitamin b6 levels in the body. this is in addition to the risk they present for internal bleeding and other medical complications. for further information, dr. julian whitaker has a helpful reference chart explaining which drugs deplete the body of which nutrients. 
the irony is that many doctors prescribing multiple drugs to their patients will advise them not to take a vitamin or mineral supplement while on the drug, when in fact the need for supplements is increased. 
there are more reasons to wonder about these drugs. unlike natural treatments, which give your body the nutrients it needs to heal itself, they directly interfere and force biological outcomes. this is bound to produce unintended consequences. 
in addition, virtually all drugs are chlorine-based, but little or no research has explored whether this in itself is a risk. while a tiny amount of chlorine is natural to the body, higher amounts are toxic. the effects of ingesting, breathing and absorbing this chemical on a daily basis, as americans do, are largely unknown. 
keep in mind also that 80 of the prescription drugs consumed in the us come from china or india . while drugs made overseas must theoretically meet us standards, in reality, widespread quality issues abound. 
think of the irony here. the prescription pill that costs a few pennies to make but sells for hundreds of dollars is made in china to save another penny. does this make sense? 
because the fda was so deficient in inspecting foreign drug manufacturers, a law was passed in 2012 that requires the agency to inspect foreign pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities as frequently as domestic facilities. but the numbers dont add up. india and china each have about 500 drug manufacturing plants registered with the fda. the fda has nineteen staff members in india, and is working on increasing the number of inspectors in china from eight to twenty-seven. 
a report by the health and human services office of the inspector general oig found that the agency was not able to meet the legal requirements. before the 2012 law was passed, the government accountability office found that the fda inspected 11 of foreign drug facilities in fy 2009, noting that at such a rate, it would take the agency more than nine years to inspect these facilities just once. and who are the inspectors? how do we know that they have not been bought off? 
meanwhile the same fda that is utterly failing to meet the inspection requirements demanded by law has issued proposed rules on new supplements which cannot possibly be implemented without huge additions to staff, and which will also cripple and even destroy the supplement industry. why is it doing this? the only reason we can think of is that the fda is so beholden to the drug industry it is supposed to regulate, but which is actually providing much of its funding. 
action alert! write to congress and the fda, urging them not to move forward with the ndi guidance please send your message immediately.

for all the fact-free cable news punditry this week about supposed momentum on the part of donald trump, its easy to miss the fact that hillary clinton is overwhelmingly likely to win the election according to every polling average and predictive model. but even as trump supporters and the pundits continue pointing to the turnout at his rallies many of which are in states hes losing, it turns out hillary clinton just pulled off one of the biggest crowds of the entire election  and she did it in a key red state. 
hillary clinton held a rally in arizona today, a state that hasnt been won by a democrat in a presidential election in a generation. its a sign that shes still playing offense. and shes within the margin of error in the polling averages in arizona, a sign of strength. moreover, she managed to draw a crowd of twenty thousand people in the red state tonight, a sign of momentum. adam parkhomenko posted a photo to facebook which captured the sheer size of the outdoor crowd

the bill and hillary crime family long ago should have been held accountable for high crimes against peace and numerous others. hillary is the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in us history, supporting endless imperial wars and state terror, once saying what do we have nato for if not to defend our way of life. there was never a war hillary did not support  crimes against humanity she endorses first-strike nuclear weapons use, calling them peacekeeping deterrents, mindless of their power to destroy life on earth. shes militantly anti-russia, earlier compared the nation to nazi germany, putin to hitler, claiming he doesnt have a soul, has revanchist aims, wanting russian greatness restored  all of the above a perversion of truth, not to mention a pretext to wage war on russia. the so-called clinton foundation is a suspected criminal enterprise, masquerading as a charitable ngo. it promotes big lies about improving global health, increasing opportunity for women and girls, reducing childhood obesity and preventable diseases, as well as creating economic opportunity and growth film producer frank huguenard believes hillary clinton faces impending federal racketeering charges under the 1970 racketeering influence and corrupt organizations act rico. enacted to fight organized and white collar crime, racketeering is defined to include fraud, bribery, money laundering, embezzlement, drugs trafficking, murder, and various other offenses under the federal criminal code title 18, even acts of terrorism. according to huguenard, obama-appointed fbi chief james comey will recommend attorney general loretta lynch treat the clinton foundation as an ongoing criminal enterprise engaged in money laundering and soliciting bribes in exchange for political, policy and legislative favors to individuals, corporations and even governments both foreign and domestic. morning joe destroys corrupt clinton foundation  total corruption strong stuff if only partly true! huguenard cites credible evidence, indicating the clinton foundation is largely a money laundering, influence peddling racket. less than 10 of tens of millions of dollars donated went for charitable purposes, the rest for self-enrichment. there is ample evidence already in the public record that the clinton foundation qualifies as a criminal enterprise and theres no doubt that the fbi is privy to significantly more evidence than has already been made public, said huguenard. if comey recommends attorney general lynch indict hillary clinton, its unlikely shell prosecute a woman shes had close ties to for years. bill clinton appointed her us attorney for the eastern district of new york  serving from 1999  2001. from 2003  2005, she was a wall street controlled new york federal reserve bank of new york board member  the mother bank most complicit with its member bank crooks. from 2002  2010, she was a washington-headquartered hogan  hartson h  h law firm partner. its new york-based partner howard topaz filed income tax returns for bill and hillary clinton, beginning in 2004. in may 2004, h  h filed patent trademark documents for denver-based mx logic inc., the computer software firm responsible for developing email encryption technology used to manage hillarys private email server, beginning in july 2013. judicial watch president tom fitton according to judicial watch president tom fitton, if h  h now hogan lovells following a 2010 merger represented the clintons on tax matters, lynch is responsible for disclosing any involvement she may have had, direct or indirect. in april 2008 during hillarys first presidential campaign, the american lawyer called h  h one of her largest legal industry supporters. loretta elizabeth lynch, attorney general of the united states. partner christine varney was chief counsel to the clintongore 1992 campaign. the ties between h  h, lynch and the clintons are longstanding. in november 2014, obama announced her appointment as attorney general, succeeding eric holder, effective april 27, 2015 after senate confirmation. its hard imagining her biting a hand contributing greatly to her career advancement. key for clinton is how much more of her dark side becomes public knowledge besides whats already known. if enough despite lynch declining to indict and supportive media scoundrels downplaying or whitewashing her offenses, the democratic sic national committee dnc might be forced to jettison her as damaged goods. shed be red meat for trump to take full advantage of in the fall campaign. would bernie sanders party bosses dont want become democrat standard bearer in july?

"politics should not ruin thanksgiving dinner the 2016 presidential election has left the country more divided than ever. as many continue to celebrate donald trumps victory, others are fighting their way through the five stages of grief surrounding hillary clintons defeat and president obamas departure. as much as some would wish otherwise, many of the wars that have stormed social media have extended through families and friendships. with thanksgiving just a couple of days away, people are concerned that opposing voters may find it difficult to enjoy a long meal together. however, politics should not ruin thanksgiving.
there is always at least one person who arrives at the family gathering ready to talk politics and express why their view is the right one. these are the worst kind of guests. politics should be the uninvited guest to thanksgiving festivities as people from around the country celebrate the many reasons to be thankful this year. anyone that brings up politics over thanksgiving dinner, with an aim of convincing another or adding insult to injury should be dismissed and possibly not invited back.
president-elect trump has done many distasteful things throughout the recent campaign, but ruining thanksgiving should not be one of them. families work hard to set up the perfect holiday gathering so they can rehash old stories, bond with the newest additions, watch their favorite football team win or lose, and celebrate life over a table filled with favorite foods. politics should not ruin thanksgiving; instead of a deadly spiral, redirect the conversation back to what really matters.
truth is, without the likes of a tumultuous election season, holidays have the potential to produce large amounts of anxiety. relatives and friends, near and far, all gathered into one location hashing out competitive family updates can be stressful enough. add some spiked cider to that mix and it becomes a recipe for a potential holiday meltdown, so there is no need for politics to ruin thanksgiving dinner.
families should remain a family long after trump takes the oval office, so politics should not accompany the turkey at the dinner table. somewhere down the track, attendees will be split along bipartisan lines. instead of joining in, why not bow out before blowing up. more than politics, preserving important relationships should be the focal point.
post-election emotions have already complicated life, as many americans have known it. navigating thanksgiving dinner should not be an added stress. as such, many who are already bruised by the election are now dreading what should be an entertaining and eventful family gathering of food and fellowship. this is a time for expressing thanks while making new memories, not overshadowed by the results of a turbulent electoral season.
politics should not ruin what has been noted as one of americas favorite holidays. with multiple personalities and beliefs at the dinner table, the only safe way to handle politics at thanksgiving dinner is by avoiding it. not only is it neither the time nor the place, but avoidance protects everyones health and sanity. the holidays intent is to bring people together peacefully and to celebrate this great countrys resiliency and diversity.

"currency crisis alasdair macleod on the vexed question of the dollar tweet home  gold  gold news  currency crisis alasdair macleod on the vexed question of the dollar there is little doubt that the rapid expansion of both dollar-denominated debt and monetary quantities since the financial crisis will lead us into a currency crisis. we just dont know when, and the dollar is not alone 

from alasdair macleod  all the major paper currencies have been massively inflated in recent years. with the dollar acting as the worlds reserve currency, where the dollar goes, so do all the other fiat monies . until that cataclysmic event, we watch currencies behave in increasingly unexpected, seemingly irrational ways. the fundamentals for japan are not good, yet the yen remains the strongest currency of the big four. the eurozone risks a systemic collapse, overwhelmed by political and financial headwinds, yet the euros exchange rate has proved relatively impervious to this deep uncertainty. the british economy is strongest, yet sterling is the weakest of the four majors. if nothing else, todays foreign exchanges are evidence that subjectivity triumphs over macroeconomic thinking. mackays extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds beats computer modelling every time. furthermore, any official attempt to establish a rate for the dollar has to address two separate questions the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, and its purchasing power for goods and services. the chart below indicates how the dollar has behaved against other currencies over the last five years, both on a trade weighted and on a predefined currency basis dxy. it should be noted that the dollar has risen on both these measures by roughly 18 since early 2014. at the same time, the chinese yuan has fallen against the dollar by about 12, so it has actually risen slightly against the dxy basket as a whole, particularly against the euro component, where it has gained 12 since early 2014. this matters, because far from devaluing, which is what we are routinely told by dollar-centric analysts, the yuan has been relatively stable over time against a basket of currencies. it has been weak against the dollar and yen, but strong against both the euro and sterling. we should look at this from the feds federal open market committees point of view. america runs a record trade deficit with china, and the only major economies where chinas terms of trade have improved are with the us, excepting japan . therefore, the fed is bound to be very sensitive to the dollars exchange rate with chinas yuan furthermore, on two occasions when the fed had signalled it was going to raise the fed funds rate, it backed off when the chinese lowered the rate at which it had pegged the yuan to the dollar. chinese devaluation against the dollar is obviously a prime concern for the fed. the situation becomes better understood when the peoples banks position is taken into account. the bank has been selling us treasury stock in large quantities, stockpiling commodities and oil with the proceeds, though it has been diversifying into japanese government bonds as well. chinas dollars have been welcomed by markets, which are short of both quality collateral and raw currency. however, chinas supply of both has failed to stop the dollar rising against the yuan. furthermore, china isnt the only asian and middle eastern state selling american paper, so the demand from other international players on the buy side has been immense, enough to determine the underlying direction of the dollars exchange rate. the situation is being exploited by the peoples bank. in effect, the peoples bank is in a position to dictate fed policy by adjusting the rate at which it is prepared to supply dollars into the market. so long as the dollar remains fundamentally strong, it only has to slow the pace of treasury and dollar sales for the dollar to rise, and therefore the feds planned interest rate rises to be deferred. this is not understood properly by western commentators, who erroneously think china is being forced to defend a declining yuan. nothing could be further from the truth. it will be interesting to see whether this happens again ahead of the december fomc meeting, when for the umpteenth time we have been promised a rise in the fed funds rate. a major consideration behind chinas foreign exchange policy is the outlook for the euro. the eurozone represents a market as large as the us, with the added importance of being tagged onto the asian continent. there can be little doubt that china sees her own long-term future being aligned more with europe than america, despite europes current troubles. it is, if you like, a situation that is primarily of strategic importance. europes economy will need rescuing at some stage, and is therefore a future opportunity for chinas intervention. that plan is for the long term, and becomes increasingly valid the deeper the hole the eurozone digs for itself. a disintegration of the eu would also be beneficial for chinese ambitions. meanwhile, in the short-term the euro has broken a crucial trend-line against the dollar, having completed a continuation head-and-shoulders pattern, targeting the 1.0600 area, which is the previous low seen in march and november 2015. this is our second chart. neither the peoples bank nor the fed need to be chart experts to see whats happening. brexit was very bad news for the euro, because it is a racing certainty that the event will turn out to be just the start of a new round of political and economic trouble for the eurozone. the italian economy in particular is imploding, with a non-performing loan problem that is roughly 40 of private sector gdp. so china can for the moment steer a course for the yuan between the euros devaluation and the dollars rise. the fed sees in euro weakness an increase of currency-induced deflation for the us economy, and a loss of competitiveness for us exports. chinese exporters are obvious beneficiaries as well, so the blame for deflation will be on chinas foreign exchange machinations. anyway, china probably cares less than she ever did about the long-term consequences of her actions on the us economy. china has been selling her us treasuries and reducing her dollar exposure to add to her stockpiles of raw materials and oil. she wants to keep her over-indebted businesses trading by maintaining a favourable exchange rate with the dollar, particularly given the developing train wreck thats the eurozone. and theres not a lot the fed can do about it. gold and commodities the principal driver for the gold price is the prospect of monetary inflation transmuting into price inflation, and the inability of central banks to respond to this threat by raising interest rates sufficiently to control the balance of consumer preferences between goods and holding money. we are, of course, measuring gold in dollars, because the latter is the reserve currency for all the others. but, as stated above, there are two exchange considerations, the first being the dollar against other currencies, and the second the dollar against a basket of commodities. and here, we should note that over the long-term, the prices of commodities measured in gold are considerably more stable than the prices of commodities measured in fiat currencies. china has behaved as if she is thoroughly aware of golds pricing attributes, and has a deliberate policy of dominating the market for bullion. this is very different from the uss domination of gold paper markets. not only has china invested in unprofitable gold mines to become the largest producer at about 450 tonnes annually, but the state monopolises chinas refining capacity. she also imports doré for refining from other countries, and without doubt since 1983 has accumulated substantial quantities of bullion not included in monetary reserves. furthermore, it is the only country that has encouraged its population, through television and other media, to accumulate physical gold. make no mistake, for the last thirty-three years, the chinese government has made a credible attempt to gain ultimate control over the physical gold market, and to extend golds protection to her own citizens. china does not manipulate the gold price. instead, as described earlier, she is manipulating the dollar by regulating the exchange rate and by discouraging the fed from raising interest rates. it is a temporary balancing act that only continues so long as desperate banks and their indebted borrowers continue to scramble for dollars, and china knows it. the fed, for the moment, appears to be powerless to manage economic outcomes and is firmly trapped by chinas currency management, with interest rates stuck at the lower bound. and to make it worse, the weak euro, against which the dollar index dxy is very heavily weighted 57!, threatens to force the dxy index even higher. the result, inevitably, is that monetary policy cannot be used to address future price inflation, which virtually guarantees there will be a higher gold price in 2017 and beyond. this is why, despite american wishful thinking, gold remains at the centre of the financial system. it is central partly because chinas ensures it is, and it is also chinas ultimate money for commodity and trade purposes. china most likely has enough gold to fully compensate for her reserve losses from the destruction of the dollar and the other fiat currencies on her reserve book. she is deliberately selling down her dollar exposure anyway, while she can. lest we forget, communist economists in china were taught that capitalism destroys itself. for them, there is no clearer proof than the performance of the us economy and the dollar, and they do not intend to get caught up in its demise. understand this, and you understand all. while the monetary role of gold

"house republicans plan secret meeting to discuss overthrowing paul ryan by jason easley on tue, nov 1st, 2016 at 938 pm the more things change, the more they stay the same. the house freedom caucus is planning a secret meeting, which in typical republican fashion was leaked to the press, to discuss ousting paul ryan and demanding more ransom from gop leadership. share on twitter print this post 
the more things change, the more they stay the same. the house freedom caucus is planning a secret meeting, which in typical republican fashion was leaked to the press, to discuss ousting paul ryan and demanding more ransom from gop leadership. 
politico reported , one of the most pressing questions preoccupying washington is what the group will do about paul ryan. the wisconsin republican has said he intends to seek another term as house speaker but has rankled members of the group of several dozen republican lawmakers that drove john boehner out of the speakership last year. the freedom caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members, some at the expense of gop leaderships authority. 
there have been early rumblings that speaker ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with hillary clinton if she wins the election. one of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right republicans to cause trouble. 
if ryans republican majority shrinks, he will be an even bigger hostage to the far-right wing of his caucus. the dysfunctional dynamic in the house is going to continue even if hillary clinton wins the election. ryan has run into the same hurdles that john boehner faced. house republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything. 
the fact that the freedom caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change. if paul ryan doesnt cave to their demands, they will force ryan out of the speaker position. 
a group of house republicans is plotting new ways to keep the house from working properly before a new president has even been elected. 
this is a reminder that washington is fine. its the republican party thats broken.",133,736270,real
"trump begins to walk back illegal immigration promises  daily wire frank camp november 13, 2016 
during an interview with lesley stahl for 60 minutes , which will air in its entirety sunday night, donald trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants 
""we are getting them out of our country,"" the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records. ""after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people who we're going to make a determination on, but before we make a determination, we want to secure our border."" 
gasp. 
donald trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration. throughout the primary process, he promised a "" deportation force ,"" telling msnbc's mika brzezinski in november 2015 
""you're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely. don't forget, mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they're waiting to come in legally. and i always say the wall, we're going to build the wall. it's going to be a real deal. it's going to be a real wall."" 
in august, trump delivered a major immigration speech in phoenix, arizona, in which he softened his stance a bit, focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes 
""within ice, i am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in america who have evaded justice."" 
he then added that ""anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation. that is what it means to have laws and to have a country. otherwise we dont have a country."" 
during the final presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton, trump reiterated his position against amnesty 
""well, first of all, clinton wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. we need strong borders."" 
for trump diehards, these statements were enough. their guy was going to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, and no one would tell them otherwise. however, as anyone with access to google should know, the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion. 
in july 2015, donald trump told cnn's dana bash 
""i would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legala lot of these people are helping usand sometimes its jobs a citizen of the united states doesnt want to do. i want to move em out, and were going to move em back in and let them be legal."" 
what trump was talking about is known as ""touchback amnesty."" such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants, but allow them an expedited means of returning to the united states in order to obtain legal status. in other words, they touch base in their home country, then come right back. 
in november 2015, eric trump repeated his father's plan during an interview with fox news' megyn kelly 
""the point isnt just deporting them, its deporting them and letting them back in legally. hes been so clear about that and i know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it, but its deporting them and letting them back legally."" 
going back further, trump's support for amnesty is even more stark. speaking on fox  friends in 2012, he said 
""for people that have been here for years that have been hard-workers, have good jobs, theyre supporting their familyits very, very tough to just say by the way, 22 years, you have to leave. get outim one of the worlds very conservative people, but i have to tell you on a human basis, how do you throw somebody out thats lived in this country for twenty years?"" 
during the 2012 presidential election cycle, trump even called mitt romney's idea of self-deportation "" maniacal ,"" and remarked that republican party policy toward illegal immigrants was "" mean-spirited ."" 
donald trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win. now that he has won, he's already backtracking on multiple campaign promises, from the repeal of the affordable care act aca to the deportation of illegal immigrants. tags",43,736282,real
"end game will michelle obama be the nominee when fbi email investigation ends hillary clintons campaign? home  headlines  world news  end game will michelle obama be the nominee when fbi email investigation ends hillary clintons campaign? 
was this the plan all along? 

from michael snyder  
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre, but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen. we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately 650,000 emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner. 
now that the fbi is going through these emails, it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november 8th. of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign. but if the fbi does quickly take action, it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day, and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate. 
in fact, there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race. for example, the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled democrats should ask clinton to step aside 
so what should the democrats do now? 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs. clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, sen. tim kaine of virginia, stand in her place. 
democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea. 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election. in a previous article, i included a quote from a u.s. news  world report articlethat explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november 8th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket, democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boat-rocking socialist sen. bernie sanders of vermont. 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots dnc members can choose to fill. 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute, a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee. 
who would they choose? 
lets take a look at the top five options 
1 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate. but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition, and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him. 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail. in fact, attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens. 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee. 
2 joe biden 
vice-president joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does, and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run 
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it. 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was re-opening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him second-guess his decision last year not to run. 
but according to the vice president, the short answer is no. the only thing that kept him from running, biden said, was the recent death of his son, beau. 
unfortunately for biden, he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does. 
biden is boring, he is not very good on the campaign trail, and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers. 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats, but he might not be a winning choice. 
3 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runner-up to hillary clinton, but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders. 
first of all, he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats. he has previously operated as an independent, and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over. 
secondly, the democratic establishment very much dislikes him, and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this. 
thirdly, democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election. 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left, it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list. 
4 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party, and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman. 
so she is definitely a possibility. 
but she does lack name recognition, and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies. 
5 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that 67 percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton. 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from 9 to 11. 
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as far-fetched as you might think. 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list, and she is generally very well-liked by the american people. and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently. for instance, her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the 2016 campaign in a recent msn article entitled in this campaign, michelle obama became more than just another political voice 
the speech, amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response, cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump, but also on herself as a voice of moral authority. three months before leaving the white house, she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title. 
when you rise to a level like that, you see how much weight your words carry, said anita mcbride, former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university. we know she didnt like politics. but she was impassioned by the language that was used, and she feels compelled to speak out. people listen to her. 
if i were the democrats, michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed, because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump. 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point. 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside, because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her. 
in the final analysis, none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day, but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen. 
and if it does happen, it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down.

"bellwether? trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes bellwether? trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes company sees preference as 'early exit poll of orthodox jews' published 9 mins ago print 
washington  the campaigns of donald trump and hillary clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the white house in january. 
a company that makes trump and hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the orthodox jewish clientele. 
so far, the company, pic-a-kippa, has sold 331 trump yarmulkes to 65 for clinton. 
my kippa yarmulke company sells trump and hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more, uri turk, founder and chief kippa officer, told wnd. we see it as an early exit poll of the orthodox jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the trump kippas. 
pic-a-kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret idf soldiers from miami. turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling trump and hillary custom kippas on its site since august, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
our mission is to help jews everywhere show and wear their jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas, the company says on its website. 
it donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the lone soldier center in israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
turk said while american jews have leaned heavily democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen orthodox jews, who make up over 10 percent of american jewry, vote republican in ever increasing numbers. he attributes that fact to the democrats putting daylight between america and israel. 
a number of influential jewish pro-trump organizations have emerged, chief among them jews choose trump and jewish democrats for trump. a recent poll of florida jews showed orthodox voters are leaning toward trump by a 3-1 margin. 
according to turk, pic-a-kippa has sold many trump kippas to a congregant of ivanka trumps synagogue on the liberal upper east side of manhattan and has gotten orders for trump kippas from israel, australia, britain and even mexico. pic-a-kippa has also gotten hate mail from jews unhappy they are selling the trump designs, he says.",238,736264,real
"trumps ex-manager he didnt even know what a gold star family is comments 
donald trump, the draft-dodging russophile who cloaks his xenophobia and bigotry in a veneer of false patriotism, reportedly had to ask what a gold star family was after he attacked the muslim-american parents of war hero capt. humayun khan. trump has thus once again proven his patriotic rhetoric to be nothing but ignorant and self-serving bombast. 
the trump-khan feud arose after khizr khan, capt. khans father, gave a powerful speech at the democratic national convention over the summer repudiating trumps hateful anti-muslim rhetoric. khan said that trump had sacrificed nothing while he and his wife had paid the ultimate sacrifice for america, and famously held up his pocket-size constitution and offered to lend it to trump. trump, who seems physically incapable of responding to criticism with anything other than blustering attacks, went on a tirade against mr. khan, adding for good measure that his wife ghazala was not allowed to speak at the dnc because she is a muslim. 
when one of trumps advisers warned him against attacking a gold star family, trump reportedly responded, whats that? paul manafort, trumps campaign manager at the time, apparently had to repeatedly explain to the candidate that a gold star family is a family that has lost a loved one serving in war. in a surprising bit of pushback from a trump campaign staff that seems to consist overwhelmingly of yes men, manafort reportedly told trump in response to his feud with khan that the election is about the american people, its not about you. 
that trump has the audacity to criticize war heros like capt. khan and sen. john mccain after using his privilege to avoid war and knowing nothing of their sacrifice, that he is so presumptuous as to adopt the mantle of fighting for america while knowing nothing about american institutions, is proof that he is nothing but an opportunistic demagogue who will say anything to appease his own ego. in stark contrast to trumps sleaze, however, khizr khan has, in the best american tradition, taken the high road. 
khan has continued to speak out for american values and against trumps hate-peddling. last week he said that there comes a time in an ordinary citizens life where you have to gather all the courage you have and you stand up and speak against tyranny and speak against un-american hate. khan has continued to get under trumps skin, with the nominee replying to that speech with the hackneyed lie that he opposed the iraq war. perhaps the reason trump has been so irritated by mr. khan is that he has demonstrated so much better than mr. trump himself what it means to be a true american.",125,736268,fake

"ex-nato chief we need us as world's policeman propaganda alert
ex-nato chief we need us as world's policeman by dominic waghorn sky "" - the man who led the west's most powerful alliance through most of the obama administration has told sky news that the president has not done enough to prevent conflict.
former nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen says america's next commander-in-chief must do more to lead the world. in an interview, he explained ""i think president obama has been too reluctant to use military force or threaten to use military force to prevent conflicts in the world.
""we need america as the world's policeman. we need determined american global leadership.""
his criticism carries more weight in the closing days of the us election campaign, and reveals the frustration of a man tasked with running the north atlantic treaty organisation during the obama years.
regardless of who wins the presidency in less than a week's time, mr rasmussen said the us has no choice but to return to the path of greater interventionism.
""superpowers don't get to retire. look around you will see a world on fire. syria torn by war and conflict. iraq on the brink of collapse. libya a failed state in north africa. russia attacking ukraine and destabilising eastern europe. china flexing its muscles, the rogue state north korea threatening nuclear attacks.
""all that requires a world policeman to restore international law and order.""
mr rasmussen also expressed deep concerns about what donald trump might do to the world should he win the presidency.
""it might be very dangerous, of course,"" he said. ""we don't know what will be the concrete policies of a trump administration - but if his statements were to be taken at face value, i consider it could be very dangerous for the world.""
the danish politician's aspirations for greater us global leadership are not shared by millions of americans, it seems.
they have supported a candidate who has advocated that the us intervenes less in foreign affairs and withdraws more.
on the campaign trail, mr trump has said america cannot carry on being the world's policeman.
whether or not mr obama could have done more to prevent conflicts is the focus of intense debate in washington.
some blame him for the turmoil roiling the middle east. others say he has skilfully managed its fallout, and greater us involvement would only have made matters worse.
aaron david miller, who has advised both republican and democratic administrations on foreign policy, says even superpowers are limited in what they can achieve - as america's next president will discover.
he said ""i think the notion that mrs clinton or mr trump will somehow be able to come up with comprehensive fixes for the world's problems or america's is an illusion.
""our constitution talks about creating a more perfect union. nowhere in the document does it say it is the objective of the american policy to create a more perfect world.
""that does not mean we need to abandon the world. we can't. but it does mean particularly in the wake of iraq and afghanistan we need to take a very hard look at what american interests are, and figure out the most effective and smart way of protecting them.""",91,736271,fake

"jesus christ's real tomb finally discovered in jerusalem underneath sepulchre church a burial slab believed to have held the body of jesus christ before he was resurrected has been uncovered for the first time in centuries by a restoration team in jerusalem.
the original limestone shelf, known as a âœburial bed,â was exposed during the restoration of the church of the holy sepulchre after being covered by marble since at least 1555 a.d.
âœit will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of christ was laid,â fredrik hiebert, an archaeologist involved in the discovery, told national geographic.
according to scripture, jesus christ was laid on the shelf in the tomb after dying at the crucifixion around 33 a.d. after three days his remains were discovered to be missing and jesus was said to have appeared over a span of 40 days before ascending into heaven.
the discovery was made by a team of scientists from the national technical university of athens ntu who were making restorations to the edicule âœlittle houseâ, a structure which had been built around the tomb.
the tomb was found underneath this crypt at the sepulchre church. throughout the years there have been many conspiracies about the location of jesuss tomb but the christian orthodox church has always maintained that the tomb is underneath sepulchre church.
researchers now hope to study the original surface to better understand the original tomb and how it evolved to become one of the most sacred sites in christendom.
we are at the critical moment for rehabilitating the edicule, chief scientific supervisor professor antonia moropoulou told national geographic. the techniques were using to document this unique monument will enable the world to study our findings as if they themselves were in the tomb of christ.
the newly-uncovered surface was described as having a grey-beige stone surface.
also known as the church of the resurrection, its custody is shared between six christian denominations including the greek orthodox church, the roman catholic church and the armenian orthodox church, whom together invited the ntu to undertake the restoration.
at a cost of us4 million, âź3.7 million the restoration was not cheap, with major donors including jordans king abdullah ii and mica ertegun, widow of atlantic records co-founder ahmet ertegun.

"russia has a dead nuclear submarine armed with nuclear weapons sitting at the bottom of the ocean - kyle mizokami bias bashers russia has a dead nuclear submarine armed with nuclear weapons sitting at the bottom of the ocean 
a fascinating vessel and a heroic captain both met tragic ends originally appeared at the national interest 
in the mid-1980s, the soviet union constructed a super submarine unlike any other. fast and capable of astounding depths for a combat submersible, the submarine komsomolets was introduced in 1984, heralded as a new direction for the soviet navy. 
five years later, komsomolets and its nuclear weapons were on the bottom of the ocean, two-thirds of its crew killed by what was considered yet another example of soviet incompetence. 
the history of the komsomolets goes as far back as 1966. a team at the rubin design bureau under n. a. klimov and head designer y. n. kormilitsin was instructed to begin research into a project 685, a deep-diving submarine. the research effort dragged on for eight years, likely due to a lack of a suitable metal that could withstand the immense pressures of the deep. in 1974, however, the double-hulled design was completed, with a titanium alloy chosen for the inner hull. 
project 685, also known as k-278, was to be a prototype boat to test future deep-diving soviet submarines. the sevmash shipyard began construction on april 22, 1978 and the ship was officially completed on may 30, 1983. the difficulty in machining titanium contributed to the unusually long construction period. 
k-278 was 360 feet long and forty feet wide, with the inner hull approximately twenty-four feet wide. it had a submerged displacement of 6,500 tons, and the use of titanium instead of steel made it notably lighter. it had a unique double hull, with the inner hull made of titanium, that gave it its deep-diving capability. the inner hull was further divided into seven compartments, two of which were reinforced to create a safe zone for the crew, and an escape capsule was built into the sail to allow the crew to abandon ship while submerged at depths of up to 1,500 meters. 
the submarine was powered by one 190-megawatt ok-650b-3 nuclear pressurized water reactor, driving two forty-five-thousand-shipboard-horsepower steam-turbine engines. this propelled it to a submerged speed of thirty knots, and a surface speed of fourteen knots. 
the sub had the mgk-500 skat nato code name shark gill low-frequency passiveactive search and attack spherical bow array sonar system, the same sonar used in todays yasen-class attack submarines, which fed into the omnibus-685 combat information control system. armament consisted of six 533-millimeter standard diameter torpedo tubes, including twenty-two type 53 torpedoes and shkval supercavitating antisubmarine torpedoes. 
the submarine joined the red banner northern fleet in january 1984 and began a series of deep diving experiments. under captain first rank yuri zelensky the submarine set a record depth of 3,346 feetan astounding accomplishment considering its american equivalent, the uss los angeles class, had an absolute maximum depth of 1,475 feet. crush depth was estimated at approximately 4,500 feet. the submarine had a special surfacing system, iridium, which used gas generators to blow the ballast tanks. 
the soviet navy considered k-278 invulnerable at depths greater than one thousand meters; at such depths it was difficult to detect and enemy torpedoes, particularly the american mark 48, which had a maximum depth of eight hundred meters. although the submarine was originally to be a test ship, it was eventually made into a fully operational combat-ready ship in 1988. it was given the name komsomolets, meaning member of the young communist league. 
on april 7, 1989, while operating a depth of 1266 feet, komsomolets ran into trouble in the middle of the norwegian sea. according to norman polmar and kenneth moore , it was the submarines second crew , newly trained in operating the ship. furthermore, its origins as a test ship meant it lacked a damage-control party. 
a fire broke out in the seventh aft chamber, and the flames burned out an air supply valve, which fed pressurized air into the fire. fire suppression measures failed. the reactor was scrammed and the ballast tanks were blown to surface the submarine. the fire continued to spread, and the crew fought the fire for six hours before the order to abandon ship was given. according to polmar and moore, the fire was so intense that crewmen on deck watched as the rubber anechoic coating tiles coating the outer hull slid off due to the extreme heat. 
the ships commanding officer, captain first rank evgeny vanin, along with four others, went back into the ship to find crewmembers who had not heard the abandon ship order. vanin and his rescue party were unable to venture fartherthe submarine was tilting eighty degrees headfirstand entered the rescue chamber. the chamber failed to dislodge at first, but eventually broke free of the mortally wounded sub. once on the surface, the abrupt pressure change caused the top hatch to blow off, throwing two crewmembers out of the chamber. the chamber, as well as the captain and the rest of the rescue party, sank under the waves. 
only four men had been killed in the incident so far, but after the submarine sank many men succumbed to the thirty-six-degree fahrenheit water temperatures. after an hour the fishing boats alexi khlobystov and oma arrived and rescued thirty men, some of whom later succumbed to their injuries. of the original sixty-nine men on board the submarine when disaster struck, forty-two died, including captain first rank vanin. 
komsomolets sank in 5,250 feet of water, complete with its nuclear reactor and two nuclear-armed shkval torpedoes. between 1989 and 1998 seven expeditions were carried out to secure the reactor against radioactive release and seal the torpedo tubes. russian sources allege that during these visits, evidence of unauthorized visits to the sunken submarine by foreign agents were discovered.",157,736269,fake
"gop has a day of reckoning coming license dmca the face of the republican party. 
there is a light at the end of this tunnel called a presidential election campaign and, if the gods are not playing a cruel trick on us, that light is not on an engine with trump emblazoned on its sides. in any event, the end is near and i am as weary of writing about this ugly affair probably as you are of reading about it. 
the problem is, that's all most of the mainstream and social media care to talk about these days. in case you missed the other news 1 the cubs and indians are in the world series. 2 heavily armed police in north dakota attacked hundreds of protesters who joined the standing rock sioux tribe trying to block construction of a pipeline they say threatens water supplies and sacred sites. 3 soupy sales, master of the pie-in-the-face, died. and 4 tim tebow is apparently just as good at baseball as he was at playing quarterback in the nfl. 
but really, the only thing the media want to talk about are donald trump's repeated claims that the election is rigged and that the press -- meaning all the news outlets who report accurately on his words and actions -- lie. 
these are claims that losers and demagogues resort to when everything else -- lies, threats, lies, threats, lies, threats -- fails. honestly, it is disheartening to feel a need to point out to, apparently, millions of americans, that trump's claims are nonsense. it is even more disheartening to realize that many of the people who still support his candidacy don't seem to care. there is a major issue to address some day soon in that. 
meanwhile, as to his two claims voter fraud is virtually non-existent in america. you can check this with any legitimate news provider. the real threat is voter intimidation -- keeping some people from voting through excessive illegal regulations and perceived threats. suggesting rigged elections is a serious threat to the very foundation of a free, democratic society -- an orderly transfer of power. this is something about which trump knows little and seemingly cares less. as far as he's concerned, if he doesn't win, the powers that be must be against him. the press. ah, the press. ""they can say anything they want,"" he complained the other day. no kidding, sherlock. you just noticed? he says if he's president he's going to change that and strip the major media companies of their power. he can try, of course. it won't be easy though. you see, donald, those same forefathers who were so wise as to guarantee americans the right to bear arms in that second amendment you and your followers are so fond of spouting and shouting about thought the idea of a free and unfettered press was so important to a functioning democracy that they wrote it into the first amendment of the constitution. that's one ahead of the guns amendment, which some might say suggests it is more important. since a civics lesson is apparently in order for trumpers, it should be noted that the first amendment also guarantees everyone freedom of religion. which is also to say, freedom from your religion. 
but these are mere facts and trump and the folks at fox news have demonstrated the power of repeating false news over and over again until listeners -- like the inhabitants of orwell's ""1984"" -- simply take it for fact. we have always been at war with eurasia. we have never been at war with eurasia. love is hate. war is peace. i know putin well. i never met the man. - advertisement - 
we are told that many trump supporters -- virtually all of them white and the majority male -- are angry and frustrated with their lives. somehow, goes the argument, all those black, brown, muslim, mexican, gay, jewish, arab, asian people who don't belong here -- and some pushy american women as well -- have prevented these trump fans from realizing the american dream. they took all the jobs and live on welfare. love is hate. up is down. bigotry has nothing to do with it. we just want to make america great again, like before all those other people said they wanted to enjoy the american dream, too. 
enough already. at some point in a person's life, if he or she is lucky, the opportunity presents itself to take responsibility for one's actions. to take stock of how things are going. not materially, but really. it can be frightening. it can also be rewarding. among other things, this look in the mirror allows one to say -- if one can be honest -- ""i've made some mistakes. i sincerely regret them. i hope to do better from now on."" a lot of people never do this. 
with that runaway train called trump menacing the trust and tolerance that are the pillars of our, yes, already great nation, i'm thinking that a lot of people -- a lot of white, republican people -- have a date with a mirror. it's far too late to undo the damage trump has done or to deny any part in it, but it's not too late to admit the mistake of supporting him in spite of all the hateful, false things he said. it's not too late to admit to acting as if he didn't say them because, well, maybe because you were angry or confused or frightened or thought it would be disloyal. maybe you feel you were lied to. or maybe you just wanted to believe the lies. 
republican politicians who have stuck with trump have no such out. the mccains and ryans and cruzes and rubios knew trump was bad news from day one. but he was their bad news and his lies became their lies even when they disagreed with him, because they never had the courage -- the humility, the simple decency -- to look in the mirror and say ""enough. this man is obscene. he is an insult to our party and our nation. we made a grave mistake in pandering to the worst instincts of some of our party members in order to get their votes. our pride kept us from admitting this. fear drove our decisions. we allowed him to make fools of us. indeed, we made fools of ourselves."" 
speaking, if i may, for the rest of an angry, resentful nation, that day of reckoning can't come soon enough. - advertisement -",127,736266,fake
"wikileaks clinton, podesta agreed not to distribute confidential intel by private email account videos wikileaks clinton, podesta agreed not to distribute confidential intel by private email account in an email released by wikileaks, john podesta said he was willing to discuss sensitive information with his future boss hillary clinton while he worked for president obama and she was a private citizen.   in this oct. 5, 2016, photo, hillary clinton campaign chairman john podesta speaks to members of the media outside clintons home in washington. 
as reported previously, when discussing hillary clintons email in which revealed us intel and strategy regarding the middle east, and disclosed that qatar and saudi arabia were funding the islamic state, john podesta said he was willing to discuss sensitive information with his future boss hillary clinton while he worked for president obama and she was a private citizen in august 2014, but he knew better than to send the intel over clintons private server from his gmail account, emails released thursday by wikileaks show. 
in the exchange which hillary clinton previewed by statingsources include western intelligence, us intelligence and sources in the region, and who had resigned as secretary of state 18 months earlier, asked then-obama counselor podesta if he knew who was responsible for an aug. 18 airstrike in tripoli, in which unidentified bombers blew up an islamist-controlled arms depot in the libyan capital. 
yes and interesting but not for this channel, podesta replied in the aug. 19, 2014 message to clintons account. 
as fox previously observed , the conversation suggests that podesta, now clintons campaign chairman, was willing to provide clinton information that had not been made public. reports from the new york times and the associated press at the time included denials of involvement from the u.s., france, italy and egypt and debunked claims of responsibility from a rogue libyan general. 
podesta, in his email response, indicated he had his own sources. but he also apparently recognized he shouldnt share the information over their personal accounts. 
its unclear if he was concerned more about the security on her clintonemail.com account or his gmail account  which would be hacked months later, in turn exposing the email chain thursday. 
podestas concern could show that at least one close clinton ally was aware of the risk of sharing sensitive or classified information over the unsecured server. 
and today, thanks to the latest  and perhaps last  wiki release, we know that hillary agreed with podesta when in the last email in that thread she replied simply, got it. it is unclear if this was the first time hillary clinton realized that sending potential confidential intelligence by private email is frowned upon.",112,736275,fake
"russia's new mig-29k carrier-based fighter to be battle tested in syria - andrei akulov citizen journalism with a punch russia's new mig-29k carrier-based fighter to be battle tested in syria 
the russian aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov is on its way to syria. itll be its first-ever combat deployment and the first battle test of its mig-29k fighters originally appeared at strategic culture foundation 
the mig-29k is all-weather ship-based multirole 4 generation fighter aircraft developed by the mikoyan design bureau . along with the su-33, the aircraft is now part of the mixed wing on the admiral kuznetsov, the russian aircraft carrier sailing to deploy in the mediterranean. the mig-29 kkub version is a two-seated variant which also can be used as a training aircraft. 
the mig-29k was originally built for the indian navy, according to a contract signed in 2004. india has purchased 45 of mig-29s over the last decade to be based on aircraft carriers vikramaditya and the future ins vikrant set to become indias first indigenous carrier in 2018. india might yet increase its mig-29k fleet. the mediterranean deployment is the best chance to showcase the ship-based jets capabilities to potential clients. 
the aircraft is in service with the russian navy since 2010. at the end of 2015, the mig aviation company fulfilled a government contract for the delivery of 24 fighters for the naval aviation to be delivered to the navy before the end of the year. the mig-29k will eventually replace the su-33. 
the fighter looks like the land-based version of the mig-29. in reality, this is a completely different aircraft with foreign electronics replaced by domestic versions, and the friend or foe identification system completely rebuilt. the modification is devised for rigors of deck operation. the mig-29k has folding wings, reinforced landing gear and an arrestor hook for carrier operations. it can perform short take-offs and land at low speeds. 
the plane is able to attain very high angles of attack. it has upgraded pilot displays and radar-absorbent coatings to reduce its radar signature. the open architecture allows the installation of new equipment and weapons. the mig-29k boasts composite materials and an integrated digital fly-by-wire system with multiple backups. it is designed to operate from unprepared airstrips with its air intakes specially protected against debris. 
the aircraft has a length of 17.3m, height of 4.4m and a wingspan of 11.9m. the maximum take-off weight is 24,500 kg. 
the weapons suite includes a 30 mm cannon with 100 rounds in the port wing root, rvv-ae and r-73e air-to-air missiles, kh-25ml25mp, kh-29t, kh-31g31a, kh-35u air-to-surface missiles . the kh-31a is a supersonic anti-ship missile resistant to air-defence. the mig-29k is the only platform to carry it. the short-range r-73 infrared-guided missile can be targeted and fired through a helmet-mounted sight without the plane being pointed at an enemy fighter. other armaments include rockets and guided aerial bombs. kh-31p passive radar seeker missiles are used as anti-radiation weapons. the plane can carry 6.5 tons of precision-guided munitions. 
according to the plans, the aircraft may test the new kh-38m x-38 missiles in syria. the missile has folding wings and tail fins for internal carriage, and would have a variety of seeker heads for different variants. depending on the variant, it can have laser, active radar, ir or satellite guidance. the weapons range is up to 40 km 21.6 nmi. the speed is mach 2.2. it can be armed with he fragmentation, cluster warhead, armor-piercing warhead weighing up to 250 kg 551 lb. the kh-38 has a 5-meter 16-ft circular error probability. 
the mig-29k has two rd-33mks turbofan engines to give it excellent acceleration and a top speed of mach 2.25. equipped with smokeless combustion chamber and new full authority digital engine control fadec system they are engineered to reduce infrared signature and improve aircraft camouflage . with 4,560 kg of internal fuel, a combat radius is 850 km 531 mi. it can be increased to 1,300 kilometers with 3 underwing fuel drop tanks. 
the fighter can both conduct aerial refueling and buddy refuel other aircraft. 
the mig-29k is equipped with three multifunctional color liquid-crystal displays a four-channel digital fly-by-wire flight control system, passive anti-radar missile homing system, sigma-95 gps receiver, topgun helmet-mounted targeting system and electronic countermeasures ecm. an onboard oxygen generating system eliminates the need for heavy oxygen canisters. the types of combat missions can be increased by adding optronicinfrared imaging reconnaissance pods. 
the avionic suite is based around the zhuk-me pulse doppler radar. with a detection range of up to 120 km, the zhuk-m radar is capable of terrain mapping and following. in the air targeting mode, the zhuk-me can track up to ten air targets while engaging four targets simultaneously. in air to surface mode the radar can detect a tank from up to 25 kilometres 16 mi away and a bridge at the distance from 120 kilometres 75 mi away, a naval destroyer could be detected up to 300 kilometres 190 mi away, while up to two surface targets can be tracked at once. the radar has a scanning area of - 85 degrees in azimuth and 56-40 in elevation. the fighter has multichannel infra-red search and track irst system with target designation system. ir and laser sighting devices for ground targets illumination can also be installed. 
the mig-29k boasts low radar cross section, advanced aerodynamics, electronic-warfare capabilities, standoff weapons and a melee of air-to-ground weapons to strike terrorist targets. 
a deployment of ship-based strike aircraft in the areas far away from the mainland is something only a first-rate world power can do. russia showcases its a member of the club. the deployment will significantly beef up the strike capability of russian forces deployed in syria. the overall strengthening of the navy in the mediterranean supports the policy aimed at strengthening russias foothold in the middle east and north africa.",157,736270,fake
"ethics complaint filed against rep. jason chaffetz for releasing comey clinton email letter an ethics complaint has been filed against representative jason chaffetz for releasing information provided to him in a letter from fbi director james comey. 
the democratic coalition against trump announced the complaint in a statement 
the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint against representative jason chaffetz on monday morning with the office of congressional ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by fbi director james comey. 
representative chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the fbi, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating secretary clintons emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. members of congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as comey in a partisan fashion. i hope that both are held accountable for their actions, said scott dworkin, senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump. 
director comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with department of justic e accusing him of violating the hatch act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election. 
the comey letter couldnt have gone much worse for republicans. what the gop originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a republican scandal that democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the senate majority . 
thanks to chaffetz, house republicans have already their credibility for future clinton investigations, a s the utah republicans spin of comeys letter was debunked in a matter of hours. 
its all gone wrong in short order for republicans. comey and chaffetz are facing complaints, and hillary clinton remains on course to be elected the next president of the united states.",133,736268,real
"bombshell declassified documents reveal why u.s. ignored saudi 911 ties bombshell declassified documents reveal why u.s. ignored saudi 911 ties 
at long last, the so-called missing 28 pages from the congressional joint inquiry into the terror attacks of september 11, 2001, have been released, albeit in redacted form. 
while obviously critical information has been obscured from the general public, the evidence remaining appears to show the hijackers and their associates received and had been receiving funds from individuals working for the government of saudi arabiaas has long been rumored and intimated. 
the redacted report also keenly criticizes failures in communication between the fbi and cia, which its authors suggest could have been a crucial intelligence breakdown prior to the attacks. 
according to the report, with all emphasis added 
the committees are particularly concerned about the serious nature of allegations contained in a cia memorandum found by the joint inquiry staff in the files of the fbis san diego field office. that memorandum, which discusses alleged financial connections between the september 11 hijackers, saudi government officials, and members of the saudi royal family, was drafted by a cia officer redacted, relying primarily on information from fbi files. the cia officer sent it to the ctc to determine whether cia had additional information. he also provided a copy to the fbi agent responsible for the investigation of one of the individuals discussed in the memorandum. despite the clear national implications of the cia memorandum, the fbi agent included the memorandum in an individual case file and did not forward it to fbi headquarters. fbi headquarters, therefore, was unaware of statements in the memorandum until the joint inquiry brought the memorandums implications to the bureaus attention fully redacted sentence concluding that paragraph. 
those connections between the planners of the 911 attack and members of the saudi royal family and saudi government are fleshed out in many of the remaining pages, despite redaction of many obviously telling points. for instance 
while in the united states, some of the september 11 hijackers were in contact with, or received support and assistance from, individuals who may be connected with the saudi government. there is information, from fbi sources, that at least two of those individuals were alleged to be saudi intelligence officers. 
even more damning, a heavily redacted paragraph suggests the reason, prior to 911, the fbi did not focus its investigations of possible terrorist ties of saudi nationals in the united states was due to saudi arabias status as an american ally. 
though it appears the joint inquiry discovered telling evidence of ties between terrorist actors and the saudi principals, the report refused to make a definitive statement on the issue due to the limited scope of its investigation. 
however, the report states, it is possible that these kinds of connections could suggest as indicated in a redacted dated july 2, 2002,  incontrovertible evidence that there is support for these terrorists within the saudi government , though that statement is downplayed with a disclaimer there may be legitimate, innocent reasons for those connections. 
another revelation the joint inquiry discovered on examining evidence suggested 
one individual who provided assistance to nawaf al-hazmi and khalid al-mindhar may be connected to the saudi government. a second individual who may have been in contact with al-hazmi and al-mindhar also has ties to the saudi government, including connections to the saudi ambassador to the united states. there is reporting in fbi files that persons have alleged that both of these individuals may be saudi intelligence officers. 
in fact, the hijackers may have been in contact with other saudi government officials in the united states prior to the attacks, andperhaps most damning of all saudi government officials in the united states may have ties to usama bin ladens terrorist network. 
one subject, in particular, omar al-bayoumi, was found to have extensive ties to the saudi government. nevertheless, congress decided not to pursue those allegations any further. 
indeed, the report states 
al-bayoumi had been an accountant at the saudi civil aviation administration from 1976 to 1993, when he relocated to the united states, and, further, the fbi found al-bayoumi was in frequent contact with the emir at the saudi ministry of defense, responsible for air traffic control. 
al-bayoumi also received regular payments from the ministry of defense through a saudi company called ercan, and he contacted saudi government establishments in the u.s. almost 100 times between january and may of 2000. 
at a closed hearing in october 2002, the document notes, a former fbi agent in san diego testified that al-bayoumi acted like a saudi intelligence officer, in my opinion. and if he was involved with the hijackers, which it looks like he was, if he signed leases, if he provided some sort of financing or payment of some sort, then i would say that theres a clear possibility that there might be a connection between saudi intelligence and ubl , with ubl being the governments acronym for usama, or osama, bin laden. 
another former agent in charge in san diego apparently said he received around six reports from individuals who suspected al-bayoumi was a saudi intelligence officer but the fbi ultimately somehow found there was not sufficient evidence to conclude as much. 
further lending credence to theories the saudis may have been directly involved in the attacks, the inquiry noted 
in testimony and interviews a number of fbi agents and cia officers complained to the joint inquiry about a lack of saudi cooperation in terrorism investigations both before and after the september 11 attacks. 
one agent even said the saudis had been useless and obstructionist for years and will only act when it is in their self-interest. 
these 28 pages certainly seem to indicate the u.s. pursued, targeted, and invaded the wrong country in its choice of afghanistan and iraq after the september 11 attacksas has been widely assumed for some time. 
though no definitive statements are made concerning conclusive proof of saudi involvementdirectly or indirectlyin the planning of 911, sufficient information is laid bare to conclude as much. in fact, the evidence calls directly into question exactly why the united states government continues to this day to categorize saudi arabia as a trusted ally.

"23 things to do to improve your mental health prev post page 1 of 4 next 
when most people make health resolutions, it usually involves their physical health. most of us make decisions to exercise more, change our diets, lose weight, and lose body fat, but there are few of us that make resolutions to better our mental health. 
preserving your mental health is one of the most important things that you can do to make sure that you are getting the most out of your life. letting your mental health slide is going to put you under more stress and will limit your ability to enjoy your life and get the most out of your relationships with others. 
the good news is, there are some simple habits that you can start using in your life right now to make sure that you are taking care of your mental health, and getting the most out of every day. 1 set a sleep schedule 
sleep is one of the most important aspects of our overall health, and many experts and doctors cite health as more critical to our overall health and survival than food or water. though, when we get stressed or life gets busy, sleep is the first thing that we start to put off. 
whether stress starts to make it harder for you to go to sleep, or you decide that you can function on less sleep to get more done, eating into your sleep is one of the worst things that you can do for your mental health. set a strict bedtime and wake up time for yourself. your body works best when it has a routine for sleeping and waking up in the morning. 
read or journal before you go to bed, and see if you can stay away from your phone, laptop, tv, or tablet. get yourself into the habit of having a habit to wind down at night. 2 focus on your strengths 
with work or in your personal life, it is so easy to be self critical and focus on only your weaknesses. our culture in working society has ingrained in us over the years to focus on what we are bad at, and get better at it. to strive for being better in all facets of our lives, and to be well rounded. 
always focusing on what you arent good at, is not good for your mental health. take an inventory of your strengths and find ways to use those daily in work and in your personal life. 3 exercise 
it can be so difficult to make time to exercise when you are exhausted with all of your daily responsibilities and obligations. between work, home, family, friends, and hobbies or downtime, the last thing that you want to worry about is commuting back to your gym to fight over equipment. 
heres the thing though, exercise is something that your body needs. whether you have been burnt out with working 9-5, being a full time student, or being a full time parent, you need to give your body the movement that it craves. 
sitting frequently throughout the day can wreck your posture, deplete your energy, and actually make you sad or depressed. you dont need to exercise for an hour every day to reap the benefits of exercising for your mental health. 
see if you can block out just 15-30 minutes per day to exercise. whether that be taking a run, lifting weights, yoga, or taking a class, the endorphins and health benefits that you get from exercising will help your mental health. 4 eat well 
diet is one of the major keys to mental and physical health. eating crappy foods, synthetic ingredients, tons of sugar, starches, and fast food can dismantle your mental health in more ways than one. 
stick to real food that your body recognizes. focus on eating fruits, vegetables, protein rich foods, and healthy fats that will digest slowly with your body, and serve more of a purpose than just filling you up. 5 be thankful 
take time every day to be thankful and start each day with thankfulness. keep a notepad or a sheet of paper to track all of the things that you are thankful for every day. 6 take life a day at a time

"little blue balls... link years ago i came here for the ufos and after a small amount of time i stopped believing, mostly due to nothing being 'real' anymore, most stuff is faked, at least in my opinion... the below is true, even if it's not as exciting as cgi videos... my main reason for posting is about one of the very few times i saw 'stuff'. back in summer of july,1974 i went on a camping trip to possum kingdom lake in west texas with a friend robert, my last trip as a single guy before i got married the following month. the trip was a lot of canoeing, swimming, cliff diving, snorkeling, and camping out at night beneath the stars, no tent, just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly. robert and i were best friends and also worked together too anyway, one really, really dark chilly and moonless night about 930pm or so, we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot elevated with no distractions to look at the night sky, i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good, i was 21 my friend was 20. he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers daily, by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep, the heat of the west texas day really took it out of us. the campsite was only accessed by boat, we used a rental canoe, so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being 20-30 foot high. they seemed a lot taller to me! we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day. so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another, i then saw, it, and said, ""look right there!"", he having binoculars he looked at where i had pointed, saw ""it"" and got pretty excited. he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following... slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent, or semi-transparent and faint bluish looking sphere, a clear 'bubble really, moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going, but not so much faster or slower than any planejet traffic would be, in my estimation. it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth. we both assumed it was a satellite. exciting stuff, but then one of us i really can't remember who noticed another one, this time coming from the east, they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude. when they were getting a little too close for comfort at least for us! the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound sphere, it wasn't laser-like at all i don't think but it appeared more like a v-shaped beam from a flashlight shot at it. it lasted all of a second, and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time. the light flash made the southbound one turn westward, now going almost the same direction as the one from the east, making them both going in the same direction, actually the one that got flashed didn't make a 90 degree turn, it was really going more of a path more like west-southwest more like 87 degrees or so, just guessing now. when i say that it turned, it turned abruptly, not at all anything like any plane would do, that struck us both as being odd, no curving involved at all. we watched them until they both grew dim from the distance, both staying in a straight line to their intended? destination. of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other, but nope. i could be wrong on the speed and the directions, but the rest is completely accurate. the really sharp turn back then was unheard of, we hear it all of the time now, years ago though it wasn't talked about at all, not even in the tabloids. this is why this really stood out out to me all of these years, that almost 90 degree turn. to be honest i just didn't understand what we had just seen. we finally got to sleep that night, i don't know how long it took us, but we did, but after a few hours around 3-ish am robert woke me up and said, ""listen!"", and i heard footsteps, that scared us pretty good 'cause we had gotten so worked up earlier, i guess. heheh we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us, well, we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep. i have to admit, o.k., yeah, i did partake myself, but only a little bit, i wasn't into it like him but i was on vacation, that made us both very paranoid, i guess anyway, the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing, the bread's plastic wrapper was there but no bread. creepy. a few years later my boss who i had told all of this to and he made fun of me told me that the same thing happened to him, his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river, they determined that it was a raccoon, which, they do this sort of thing, i know now. now to regular people that might not seem like much, especially now days, here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily. still, for back then it was really something. my older brother by 3-12 years and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of caddo lake in east texas around 1981 in the spring, may i think, and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers. that's all they were known as back then our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard, it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties, after all, that was its heyday. as we stared at the sky in the back of my pick-up i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom lake, he being quiet through the entire story, he wasn't that talkative really, and within 5 minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one. i had my own binoculars this time! i was really amazed, it was exactly as what i had seen before, i mean exactly! nothing major happened though, it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right, and that was that. my brother was never a believer anyway, maybe had it landed it would change his mind. we saw several regular ol' satellites afterwards too. why i even bring this up is that when i first started coming here around 2008 lurking i read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing i did, with the slightly v-shaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away, i'd really love to read that again, it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed. i say, ""confirmed"" because that friend, robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a lot of people at work. we hardly talked about anything else on that trip, and especially on the way home too. assuming he felt as i did i brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work, maybe 10-12 people, i didn't see the harm in telling what we saw. after i said my piece i said, ""ask robert"". robert said i was crazy and he didn't see a thing, i thought he was kidding but he was being serious, you'd think that on the way back he'd say that he wasn't wanting to tell anyone, but, nooo... edit on 26-10-2016 by recrisp because typo",4,736263,fake
"what is anonymous? what anonymous is and what it means really depends on the individual; to one person it means one thing, and to another, something else. anonymous has even been around long enough, these days, that there is actually a generational gap developing. protesters wearing anonymous guy fawkes masks take part in a demonstration against controversial anti-counterfeiting trade agreement acta, on february 25, 2012 in nice, southeastern france. afp photo  valery hache
think about it in this perspective the matrix is already 17 years old; there is an entire generation which didnt grow up with it!
the oldest members are naturally the most die-hard anons, and the older the member, typically, the better the hacker  there are becoming fewer and fewer of them by the day. for the most part the oldest anons are of the mind that anonymous should be an exclusive hacker collective  everyone who cant hack is largely considered a n00b or just a fan of the movement.
anons protesting against the government
the newest members of anonymous tend to be social justice warriors of sorts; almost none of them are hackers, but they make up the large majority of people who now call themselves anonymous. they are, for the large part, protestors, civil rightsliberties advocates or people who want to change the world, but are unsure on how to go about it. they seem to be drawn to anonymous, not because all of the hacks occurring around the world, but because they see anonymous publicly advocating for many of the same things they believe in.
there are a lot of things happening in this world that people do not get to vote on, or simply have no say over; there are a lot of things that tend to controldictate peoples lives, for which they have no control over.
i remember a conversation last year with a friend in the movement. i was frustrated because all i want is to change and make an impact on the world, but always feel like nothing more than an ant  nothing i seem to do is even measurable in the grand scheme of life.
they responded, welcome to the anthill.
just as with any group of people in the world, or in politics, there are bound to be some fringe lunaticsextremists on both sides of the spectrum  and anonymous is no different.
people do not seem to understand that no one in anonymous speaks for anyone else in anonymous. far too often, people in anonymous are left defending  or accused  for the actions of other people they know nothing about. people also do not seem to understand what it means when some says anonymous is an idea, not a group.
what it means to be part of an idea can also differ depending on the purpose. but what i have come to believe this idea means is a freedom of expression in its purest form freedom from censorship; freedom for all knowledge to be free and available to the publicsociety; freedom for people to stand up and fight for whatever they believe in; freedom for everyones voice to matter  not just corporationspoliticiansgovernment elites.",16,736265,fake

"fbi director james comey schooled by former doj spokesman for abusing his power by sarah jones on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 1105 pm matthew miller, self described ""recovering flack from doj, dscc"", schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within 60 days of an election. share on twitter print this post 
former doj spokesman for eric holder matthew miller, a self described recovering flack from doj, dscc, schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within 60 days of an election. 
the department and the fbi have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and director comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case, miller said on cnn. but this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election, and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last 60 days let alone the last 11 days. 
watch here 
miller also held school on twitter about comeys abuse of power, which has led to hillary clinton having to defend against a negative i wrote a piece in july on why comey's public comments about clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power. 1  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 he flagrantly violated doj rules with his press conference. then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to congress2 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 followed by quickly releasing fbi 302's, something they rarely do, and which i doubt they will do for future high-profile cases. 3 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 each time, he either violated or seriously stretched doj rule  precedent. press conference was the original sin,  it begat the rest. 4 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 but today's disclosure might be worst abuse yet. doj goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election. 5 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 not just public discussion either. often won't send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over6 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 why? because voters have no way to interpret fbidoj activity in a neutral way. who is the target of an investigation? what conduct? 7 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 this might be totally benign  not even involve clinton. but no way for press or voters to know that. easy for opponent to make hay over. 8 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 which takes us back to the original rule you don't comment on ongoing investigations. then multiply that times ten close to an election. 9 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 for whatever reason  there are many theories, comey continues to ignore that. but only for clinton. 10 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 fbi is undoubtedly investigating links between the russian hack, manafort,  the trump campaign. but aren't commenting on it. good! 11 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october 28, 2016 
miller points out, this just smells worse and worse the more we learn, linking to this emails ""were not to or from clinton"" and appeared like info fbi already had. wtf???  
 ken gude kengude october 29, 2016 
the problem with comeys actions isnt that he is investigating hillary clinton; the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election. it is an established rule that ongoing investigations arent commented on for obvious reasons. 
this is quite simply not done. comeys reasons for doing this are unclear, and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense. but its troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rulesagreements of law surrounding the trump campaign, which seems to have lowered the bar all around.

"north carolina republicans sued for rigging the election for trump by rmuse   1000 am the voter suppression tactic is right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in north carolina.   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
some americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else; as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions. as soon as the republican primaries concluded, donald trump projected republicans guilt for election rigging, either through vote obstruction or suppression, onto democrats and his opponent hillary clinton. republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of barack obama in 2008, and they have only ramped up their  election rigging activities over the past eight years; and yet trump accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath. 
yesterday, the north carolina conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp filed a lawsuit against north carolina republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the  coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state . what the naacp rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was  right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in the state.  
the election rigging amounts to three counties in north carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of, mostly african american, democratic residents a week before the presidential election. the lawsuit charged election officials in beaufort, moore, and cumberland counties of denying primarily african american voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were  bounced back as undeliverable.  
most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging, such as james edward arthur sr. had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots. many of the purged voters lived at their  original registration address  and were victims of a  simple postal service error.  
mr. arthur is an african american who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last 14 elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue. arthur testified that he, like thousands of other african american democratic voters, never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied, or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy. mr. arthur said, 
 if i knew my right to vote was in jeopardy, i would do whatever i could to protect it. i want and plan to vote in the upcoming election, but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted . 
it is what any sane human being would consider  election rigging  simply because the tri-county ploy targeted primarily african americans who typically vote for democrats. it is also something north carolina republicans have been guilty of for the past six years. 
according to the naacp lawsuit, north carolina republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which  bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final 90 days before an election . republican election officials state officials defended their  election rigging  and said they were justified in  purging tens-of-thousands  of mainly african american democratic voters eligibility, the definition of systemic, on an individual basis. 
however, the naacp also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly african american voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing. one republican who ran for a local office last year, shane hubers, challenged the registration of voters, the majority who are them democrats,  in beaufort county. 
in one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit, cumberland county, one  individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of 3,951 mostly democratic voters . in moore county, the secretary of the local republican party, n. carol wheeldon, challenged approximately 400 mainly african american registered voters; likely because they do not vote for republicans. 
the lead attorney for the naacps lawsuit, penda hair, said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican  election rigging  conspiracy; 
 we know that in two of the counties, the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party. we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties . ms. hair also noted that,  in moore county the return address of a right-wing group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters. this is a very pernicious treatment of voters , she said. it is also a deliberate act of  election rigging  by republicans. 
the president of the north carolina naacp, reverend dr. william barber said, 
 we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north carolina that weve seen since the days of jim crow. the tar heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters. these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution . 
the naacp lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since 2012 using this election rigging  process back on the rolls immediately. the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters, and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day. they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case. 
it might be the case that the naacps request for a hearing may be granted; especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north carolina republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another manner; failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a dmv office over the past few years. 
last thursday u.s. district court judge loretta biggs ordered north carolina republicans to permit those tens-of-thousands of voters to cast provisional ballots. it is highly doubtful that north carolina republicans will obey the federal judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters. 
republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the american people first elected barack obama as president, and the conservatives on the supreme court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with republicans to suppress, or obstruct, the voting rights of primarily people of color because they dont support republicans. to be perfectly clear, it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression, obstruction, or disenfranchisement; it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections. and it is only republicans and the koch brothers outfit the american legislative exchange council alec, who are behind each and every attempt in republican-controlled states to kill democracy by doing what the republican party standard bearer donald trump is guilty of projecting; rig elections.",133,736269,real

"did democrats really stuff ballot? here's their answer print fairfax county, virginia, voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot, among others 
democratic party officials in fairfax county, virginia, are categorically denying that pro-democrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot, arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee, or fcdc. 
earlier this week, jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot. see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article. also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters. 
i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year, jena explained. then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee, giving me a step-by-step, yes-and-no what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot. 
in recent days, at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots. 
after the report was first published, and shared on facebook by david jones, fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained. 
these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot. the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections. political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots. the two envelopes arrived at the same time, commented anderson. 
that triggered a quick back-and-forth between david jones and anderson. 
i hate to tell you but youre wrong. all items came in one envelope, jones said. 
like the reporting you see here? sign up for free news alerts from wnd.com, americas independent news network. 
impossible. that letter came out of my office. we never have access to other peoples ballots, replied anderson. 
then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters, said jones. who should i believe? you or my lying eyes? 
anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot, and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives. 
i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed. we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots. you can believe what you want to believe, concluded anderson. 
the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response. but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america, anderson protested the premise of the story. 
please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim, stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate. 
he shared a photo sent by state sen. scott surovell, showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy. 
in a formal interview, fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true. 
its not possible, said neilson, who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats. 
voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen, he said. the activity of voting is also a public record. the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot. we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed. 
the same day the ballot is mailed, our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot, said neilson, noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax. 
listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson 
however, he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself. 
that material is mailed in a separate envelope, labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax, virginia, and would be received either the same day, perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government, neilson said. 
its a separate mailing. its a separate stamp. its a separate envelope. its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes, he said. 
jones is standing by her story 100 percent, as is her husband. david says its a very clear memory. 
jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot, the green sample ballot, the two-sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature. there was also the return envelope, which i signed, david said. 
the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters. both of them commented on reddit. 
i can confirm this. i live in herndon, va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot. i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it, stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename.

another, under the reddit handle nightingale-nights, said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week. 
neilson said there is no way the county government, which sends out the ballots, could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot. 
they dont have our materials, he said. our materials are printed for us, by our printer, and we have complete control over our materials in our office, and they come from our office in our mailing. they dont go anywhere else. 
its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials. its never happened before. im not aware of it happening now. and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future, neilson said. 
there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county, leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible. he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot. 
i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots. i believe that, jones said. i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material. i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope. but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues. 
neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true. 
i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail, neilson said. 
he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight. 
i am an election official. on election day, i serve in a non-partisan capacity for our county election office, nielson said. i can assure you, you have democrats and republicans working in the office. you have plenty of oversight of the voting process, and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot. there is no way that happened.

"7 reasons trump won  daily wire aaron bandler november 11, 2016 
president-elect donald trump. that is still a term that is surreal to a lot of people, as he was not expected to win on tuesday. what were the driving factors that propelled trump to the presidency? how was he able to pull off such a stunning upset? 
here are seven reasons why trump won. 
1. hillary clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her. last night, dems were calling the race a ""whitelash"" -- wrong. mitt won 59 of white vote, trump won 58. minority voters didn't turn out.  david french davidafrench november 9, 2016 
in fact, trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than mitt romney did in 2012, as the daily wire has explained  
unsurprisingly, trump lost to clinton in the latino and black votes by margins of 88 percent to 8 percent and 65 percent and 29 percent, respectively. surprisingly, this was better than romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in 2012, as he lost both groups by margins of 93 percent to 7 percent and 71 percent to 27 percent, respectively 
michael barone has noted that ""turnout fell in heavily black philadelphia, cleveland, detroit, and milwaukee. millennial generation turnout was tepid, and trump carried white millennials by 5 points."" 
the enthusiasm was just not there for clinton. 
2. trump was able to pull in former obama voters. according to the washington post , trump was able to win over one-third of the 700 counties that went for obama twice. clinton was only able to win six of the 2,200 counties that didn't go for obama. trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than clinton was. 
so who are these former obama voters who voted for trump in 2016, and what caused them to switch? 
3. these former obama voters felt that trump cared about them, and the democrat party did not. john daniel davidson explains in the federalist that clinton and the democrat party took the blue-collar, working class whites in the rust belt for grantedexemplified by clinton's pledge ""to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business""and it was to their detriment. the rust belt has been in economic decline for years, but it has suffered greatly from the obama administration's regulations towards coal. 
while the democrats wrote off the rust belt, trump actually acknowledged their struggles, and that was all it took. 
""trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them, acknowledged that they have been left behind, that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline, and promised to help out somehow,"" writes davidson. ""when youre used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion, as president obama did in 2008, or denounced as 'deplorables' and 'irredeemable,' as hillary clinton did during this election, respect goes a long wayeven if there are no easy solutions, from washington or anywhere else, to the problems that plague your town."" 
4. the fbi re-opening its investigation into hillary's emails helped trump. per redstate , author ed klein said on the steve malzberg show that clinton was sobbing ""inconsolably"" on election night and was blaming fbi director james comey re-opening the investigation as well as obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost. 
there's no question that the re-opening of the investigation did considerably help trump, as the polls severely tightened after the announcement. poll numbers showed that the vast majority of americans felt that hillary was acting in an immoral manner. the spotlight was off of trump's vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers, and instead the focus was on clinton's private email server. but clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss... 
5. hillary was a terrible candidate. if clinton had been elected president, she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous fbi investigations. she broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official state department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the clinton foundation . clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure, sleaze, and corruption. basically, clinton is ""an obama democrat without obama's charm,"" according to jonah goldberg . 
she may have been the only democratic candidate that could lose to trump, and the democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning. they have no one to blame but themselves for president trump. 
6. the public no longer has any faith in the mediaand that includes late-night comics. will rahn wrote at cbs news that the ""unbearable smugness"" of the clinton-biased media was off-putting to a lot of voters, as they sneered at trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up clinton. trump's vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically. poll numbers reflect this, as trust in the media has declined over the years. rahn explains 
journalists increasingly dont even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement, and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way. we see this in the ongoing veneration of facts, the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously post-ideological. 
that the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soul-searching youd think it would. instead, it all just somehow leads us to more smugness, more meanness, more certainty from the reporters and pundits. faced with defeat, we retreat further into our bubble, assumptions left unchecked. no, its the voters who are wrong. 
as a direct result, we get it wrong with greater frequency. out on the road, we forget to ask the right questions. we cant even imagine the right question. we go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases. the publics estimation of the press declines even further -- fewer than one-in-three americans trust the press, per gallup -- which starts the cycle anew. 
the same applies to late-night comics. mollie hemingway writes in the federalist that jon stewart is partly responsible for the election of trump because of how he single-handedly destroyed cnn's crossfire, resulting in ""a new age of hyper-political, hyper-liberal late-night comedy."" stewart's the daily show spawned stephen colbert, john oliver, trevor noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy left-wing political lectures talking down to conservatives. 
""jon stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day,"" writes hemingway. ""he got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree. the results include a further erosion of civility, a decrease in americans ability to understand each other and their concerns, and, of all things, president-elect donald trump."" 
which all culminates into the main reason why trump was elected... 
7. americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites. ben shapiro explains  
trump won because many americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as barack obama and his department of justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country. 
trump won because many americans were sick of watching other americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance  for their religious beliefs, for their unwillingness to label women men and men women, for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates. 
trump won because many americans were tired of the medias constant harping on americas flaws  we were supposedly sexist, racist, and homophobic. americans said that they did not believe the media, and they were right to do so. 
in other words, the left has been tearing down america as a country infested with intolerant, prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives. the people finally had had enough, so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites. tags",43,736280,real

"7 things you need to know about trump attorney general pick jeff sessions  daily wire 7 things you need to know about trump attorney general pick jeff sessions by aaron bandler november 18, 2016 
president-elect donald trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is sen. jeff sessions r-al, who has long been a favorite of conservatives. the democrats already have the long knives out for sessions, spit-balling their usual accusations of racismwhich should indicate that sessions will be an effective attorney general. 
here are seven things you need to know about sessions. 
1. sessions has a 78 percent liberty score on conservative review . sessions has been in the senate for 20 years, and has been described by the washington times as ""a tea partier before the tea party was cool,"" per conservative review 's biography . 
2. sessions has been one of the leaders in the senate in fighting against amnesty. for instance, sessions was among the most prominent members of the senate leading the opposition to the gang of eight bill. national review , which dubbed sessions ""amnesty's worst enemy,"" explained how sessions would reveal ""true facts"" about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadn't decided how to vote on the legislation. sessions and sen. david vitter r-la would find other clever ways to oppose the bill, such as ""an amendment to a resolution honoring the late latino union organizer cesar chavez"" in which vitter noted chavez's opposition to illegal immigration, putting sen. bob menendez d-nj in ""an awkward position."" 
in 2015, sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system, according to conservative review  overturned the zadvydas v. davis supreme court case that obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off dhs and doj law enforcement grants expedited deportation of gang members applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the washington, d.c. mansion murders 
sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration, as he has railed against it as ""the primary source of low-wage immigration into the united states."" 
""what we need now is immigration moderation slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together,"" sessions wrote in a 2015 op-ed in the washington post . 
3. sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues. according to conservative review 's biography of sessions 
in january 2011, he was named ranking member of the senate budget committee. in this capacity, he led the republican charge against majority leader harry reid and barack obama for not offering a serious budget proposal, given that the senate had not passed a budget since april 2009. he has fought guerilla warfare, often a lonely battle, against democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps. he has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the ryan-murray budget deal. sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state. 
sessions has voted against the tarp bailout, stimulus bills, and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state ""with charts warning of the united states' 'crippling' debt,"" per the washington post . 
4. sessions endorsed trump early on. to the surprise of many in the establishment, sessions endorsed trump in february, declaring , ""i believe we are on a movement that must not fade away. this is a campaign, this is a movement. the american people are not happy with their government."" 
it shouldn't have come as a surprise though, given session's record on immigration and that sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade. 
5. sessions is well-liked by his senate colleagues on a personal level. according to the washington post  
""say what you will about him,"" former longtime senate democratic communications aide jim manley told the almanac of american politics. ""he was always nice to the late ted kennedy and other democrats as well."" 
even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. stanley-becker talked to susan parker, a democrat who tried to unseat sessions in 2002. during a debate, she asked for a tissue and sessions handed her one. she joked she would use it to dry her eyes when sessions made her cry, and he responded ""please dont say that. thats my nightmare. i promise ill be nice."" 
it's no wonder then that sessions will likely be confirmed by the senate. 
6. accusations of racism against sessions are absurd. when president ronald reagan nominated sessions, who at the time was a u.s. attorney, to a federal judge, the democrats smeared sessions with accusations of racism, which included calling a black attorney ""boy."" quipping about the ku klux klan ""i used to think they were ok, but they are pot smokers."" joking that a white attorney was ""a traitor to his race"" because he was collaborating with civil rights groups. calling the naacp and aclu ""un-american."" prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud. 
the last point isn't racist at all. the jokes, as ben shapiro has written , were made ""in front of the black lawyer; even the lawyer accusing sessions of racism acknowledged that sessions was joking."" clearly sessions meant them as harmless jokes. sessions has also denied calling the lawyer ""boy."" the civil rights group sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years. 
sessions' record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism, as the weekly standard 's mark hemingway writes 
as a u.s. attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in alabama. and he also prosecuted the head of the state klan, henry francis hays, for abducting and killing michael donald, a black teenager selected at random. sessions insisted on the death penalty for hays. when he was later elected the state attorney general, sessions followed through and made sure the hays executed. the successful prosecution of hays also led to a 7 million civil judgment against the klan, effectively breaking the back of the kkk in alabama. 
7. as attorney general, sessions would uphold the rule of law. the reason why sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law. he has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty. between that and his legal background as a u.s. attorney and alabama attorney general, there is every reason to believe that sessions will follow the law and not politicize the justice department. 
""his interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but i predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor,"" robert driscoll , former deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in national review . ""clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor. creative interpretations of the law may cease, but the meat-and-potatoes work of the division intentional discrimination, police misconduct, disability law will continue apace, conducted without impropriety or political favoritism. that alone will be a breath of fresh air."" tags",43,736287,real

 donald j. trump realdonaldtrump november 1, 2016 
the trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing; elections are not rigged if trump gets his way, and neither are polls if trump is leading. otherwise, its all left-wing shenanigans. 
however, even newt gingrich isnt buying the new poll washington post-abc poll is an absurdity. trump has not moved up 13 points in the last 8 days.he was never 12 points behind. ignore polls 
 newt gingrich newtgingrich november 1, 2016 
and what trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if johnson and stein are taken out of the mix then clinton leads by 1 . 
these latest claims are an absolute sham as clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and comeys email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to trumps camp. 
meanwhile, trumps own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative , and if there is any evidence of a clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in bossies own head. 
david bossie is living proof that clintons vast right-wing conspiracy is real, and all the hating on hillary isnt going to change the fact that it is trump who is the crooked candidate, not hillary clinton.",133,736270,real

most americans know jason chaffetz as the rogue republican congressman who can get away with being as dishonest and duplicitous as he wants because his conservative district in utah keeps reelecting him no matter what he does. he was caught using private email for work purposes while he was trying to take down hillary clinton for doing the same. and last week he flat out lied about an fbi letter in clear violation of federal law under the hatch act. but just when you think chaffetz cant be dirtier, it turns out his campaign is literally being funded by a criminal enterprise controlled by overseas investors. 
the single biggest campaign donor jason chaffetz is a company called nu skin enterprises. research done by reverb press has revealed that it adds up to nearly six figures in total, a surreal dollar amount for a fairly obscure company to give to a single congressmen. but despite the lack of name recognition, nu skin is a billion dollar pyramid scheme which pushes questionable anti-aging miracle cures. and its been busted by the feds for criminal behavior resulting in tens of millions of dollars in penalties. 
bizarrely, nu skin enterprises is now being bought up by overseas chinese investors to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, placing the company largely under overseas control even as its begun its illegal business practices into china. included in the investors list family members of former chinese premier wen jiabao. so what does this all have to do with congressman jason chaffetz? in short, a busted criminal pyramid scheme now controlled by chinese political figures has been funding its very own member of congress from the very start of his political career. in fact, before entering politics, chaffetz used to be an employee of the company. with each new turn, the story grows stranger. if you enjoy daily news bin, consider making a contribution contributed by daily news bin staff 947",40,736271,fake

"conservatives already plotting to block clintons scotus picks, let court die out by sean colarossi on wed, oct 26th, 2016 at 834 pm not even an overwhelming victory by hillary clinton is likely to convince republicans that they should do their job. share on twitter print this post 
since republicans have essentially conceded that donald trump is going to lose the general election to hillary clinton, theyre already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate supreme court justices. 
according to a report from the huffington post on wednesday, one conservative thinker says that john mccains recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by clinton isnt that farfetched. 
the report 
some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to mccains controversial suggestion last week that senate republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all supreme court nominees put forth by a future president hillary clinton. 
who needs a fully functioning supreme court after all? 
as a matter of constitutional law, the senate is fully within its powers to let the supreme court die out, literally, wrote the cato institutes ilya shapiro in a column wednesday on the federalist. 
shapiro is well-versed in constitutional issues, and his argument has a legal, if contorted, basis. nothing in the constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nations highest court  if not an entire branch of the federal government  to stop clinton from selecting judges who share her views. 
 
to shapiro, theres nothing wrong with even more senate obstructionism because the constitution is completely silent on how the upper chamber provides its advice and consent on the presidents nominees. 
 
so when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and inauguration day, if hillary clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the senates constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names, he concluded. 
the original argument from republicans was that they would block president obamas supreme court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the nov. 8 election. forget the fact that this isnt how the constitutional system is meant to operate, but that was their reasoning. 
now, faced with the growing prospect that hillary clinton will be elected the 45th president of the united states, they are beginning to change their tune. 
the obstruction that defined the republican party throughout obamas presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone. its yet another reason why down-ballot races are more critical than ever this year.",133,736264,real

a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law. 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable, wrote justice tom parker this week. federal judges, as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v. hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to same-sex marriage, are unaccountable and unelected. 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting u.s. supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected. chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were, consequently, unaccountable. 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning, history, tradition, the courts own rules, or the rule of law, but upon their empathetic feelings.' 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges, he said. 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore, who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriage-based case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case, which created same-sex marriage nationwide, was announced. 
moore, who is challenging the punishment, insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves. they did, with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments. 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel, because retired judges, too, are unelected and unaccountable. 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda, instead of faithfully applying the rule of law, parker warned. obergefell is not the first case concerning same-sex marriage to prove this principle true. before the united states supreme court decided obergefell, the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states. 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book, now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family? 
before obergefell, 40 states passed laws affirming traditional marriage. in 37 of those states, the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional. of the 37 state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts, 24 of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional. each of the 24 courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable. 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account, citing the situation that developed in iowa. 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional. the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa. however, although the judges are initially appointed, they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires. 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted one-man-one-woman marriage as law, in april 2009, in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism, the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional. 
the very next year, three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election; all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa. this was the first time since iowa adopted its retention-election system that any judge had ever failed to be retained. the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law. 
mathew staver, chairman of of liberty counsel, which is representing moore, said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case. 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law. he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law, he said. 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable. at every turn, this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama. never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired. we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution. the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the 9-0 vote. never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule 16 has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term. a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a four-page order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life. this is not right. 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart, who has been acting as alabamas chief justice. 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore. 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization. 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics, fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary, they will no doubt take our complaint seriously, as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore, said tom ford, a spokesman for the group. 
the complaints, the group said, outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety, failed to perform the duties of her office impartially, failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary. 
daniel horowitz , senior editor at conservative review, told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation. 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues, whether its the bureaucrats, whether its the courts, and as it relates to even religious liberty, even property rights, immigration, our voting rights, who gets to vote, he said. 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america. 
how did we get here? horowitz asked rhetorically. and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this. this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges, the legal profession, and unelected bureaucrats. that is social transformation without representation, which, as scalia warned, is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution. 
same-sex marriage was mandated for the nation in 2015 by the bare 5-4 majority made up of anthony kennedy, ruth ginsburg, stephen breyer, sonia sotomayor and elena kagan. john roberts, clarence thomas, samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it. 
the majority found in the constitution a right to same-sex marriage, overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states. 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the u.s. supreme court majority. 
for one, two of the justices in the majority, kagan and ginsburg, were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for same-sex marriage, apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality. without their votes, the case would have gone the other way. 
they refused. 
then there was the u.s. supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier, in the defense of marriage act case, in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage. 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people. 
as wnd reported , ginsburg, who voted in favor of same-sex marriage, has performed same-sex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements. justice elena kagan also has performed same-sex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm. 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case, but they refused to acknowledge the request. the foundation explained that canon 3a6 of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court. 28 u.s.c. sec 455a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. 
rabbi jonathan cahn, author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah 910 judgment movie, has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage. 
at a prayer event in washington, he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage. that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation. 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained. 
justices, can you judge the ways of god? there is another court and there is another judge, where all men and all judges will give account, he warned. 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty, should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation? we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal, he said.

the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling same-sex marriage an intrinsic evil. 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court.

it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states, said the statement from the american principles project . 
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case. to recognize the authority of states to define marriage, and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions. to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons. to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell.",238,736264,real

"us feigns human rights concerns in philippines  new eastern outlook column politics philippine president rodrigo duterte is heading a controversial campaign against crime, embodied in his war on drugs which has led to violence spanning the nations troubled urban centers. president dutertes comments have ranged from reasonable, to utterly indifferent regarding fears of extrajudicial executions, vigilantism, and very real human rights abuses  opening a door of opportunity for his political opponents both at home and abroad. president dutertes inability to clearly condemn extrajudicial executions and vigilante violence, along with his inflammatory, provocative, even dangerously demagogic statements both invites further abuses, as well as both legitimate and opportunistic criticism of him, his administration, and his policies. while legitimate criticism is both necessary and justified, it is undermined by disingenuous political opportunism, wielded by hypocrites who only stand to compound the philippines current crisis, not solve it. america the humane? among president dutertes more opportunistic political opponents is the united states. while the united states would otherwise be justified and morally grounded in its criticism of president dutertes administration, there are some current and past complications that reveal such criticism as stark hypocrisy, crass opportunism, and even the cynical political exploitation of abuse, rather than any genuine attempt to constructively address or stop it. the most recent manifestation of americas feigned concern regarding the philippines ongoing campaign against accused illicit narcotic dealers was the blocking of a shipment of us-made rifles destined for philippine police units. some 26,000 rifles were on order before being blocked by the us senate based on concerns about human rights violations. these concerns, however, have not prevented the us from selling billions of dollars worth of weapons, including warplanes, munitions, tanks, and helicopters to saudi arabia, who is using this vast us-made arsenal to oppress its own people and execute a war of aggression against neighboring yemen. saudi arabia is also admittedly involved in arming and funding terrorist organizations in syria and iraq, including with us-made weapons  particularly anti-tank tow missiles. this hypocrisy exposes us concerns as merely politically motivated, designed to put pressure on manila in an effort to reassert us influence over the southeast asian state. not only has the us previously enjoyed greater influence over the philippines since the end of world war ii, but before the war, and for half a century, the united states literally controlled the philippines as a us territory. it seized the philippines in a bloody 1899-1902 war that claimed the lives of over a quarter of a million people  some sources estimate over half a million , and initiated an occupation marked by brutality, oppression, and torture, including the introduction of water boarding then called water curing conducted by the us as a means of attitude adjustment for local philippine leaders. it is ironic and telling that both water boarding and attempts by the us to maintain influence over the philippines both persist to this day. attempts by the us to predicate its desire to control manila on concerns about human rights violations not only is bitterly ironic, it undermines those genuinely attempting to expose and stop real abuses taking place amid the philippines current crisis. president duterte has been able to insulate himself from criticism precisely because of us hypocrisy and meddling. had independent, local activists and media platforms  networked with regional and international organizations  attempted to expose and rein in president dutertes anti-crime campaign, it would have been immeasurably more difficult to dismiss the facts and continue with impunity. the us has in essence discredited genuine human rights concerns by hijacking them for self-serving political objectives. extrajudicial executions, vigilante violence, and president dutertes indifference, even defense of both, needs to be opposed  but by the people of the philippines  not disingenuous, exploitative, and self-serving foreign interests who are not only notorious human rights abusers today  worldwide  but who have carried out campaigns of extermination, torture, and human rights abuses in the philippines itself, as a foreign conqueror and occupier. for president duterte, it is more than possible for him to lead a more dignified and just campaign against criminals operating across the philippines. nations like singapore have used stern, popular, but legitimate judicial measures to rein in the drug trade and organized crime, so can the philippines. doing so would close this door of opportunity president duterte himself opened to the americans, and leaves open with his current policies. tony cartalucci, bangkok-based geopolitical researcher and writer, especially for the online magazine  new eastern outlook.  popular articles",98,736284,fake

"donald trump calls meeting with pressdresses down real fake news networks everyone at cnn is a liar and you should be ashamed go to article 
they had to know they had it coming 
donald trump scolded media big shots during an off-the-record trump tower sitdown on monday, sources told the post. 
it was like a fing firing squad, one source said of the encounter. 
trump started with cnn chief jeff zucker and said i hate your network, everyone at cnn is a liar and you should be ashamed,  the source said. 
the meeting was a total disaster. the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration, but instead they got a trump-style dressing down, the source added. 
a second source confirmed the fireworks. 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks, the other source said. 
trump kept saying, were in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar, and cnn was a network of liars, the source said. 
trump didnt say nbc reporter katy tur by name, but talked about an nbc female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when hillary lost who hosted a debate  which was martha raddatz who was also in the room. 
the stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a trump administration. 
cbs good morning co-host gayle king did not stand up, but asked some question, how do you propose we the media work with you? chuck todd asked some pretty pointed questions. david muir asked how are you going to cope living in dc while your family is in nyc? it was a horrible meeting. 
heres a sampling of trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail. trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before, he won the election in a landslide, in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down 
trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway told reporters the gathering went well. 
excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks, she said during a gaggle in the lobby of trump tower. pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days. 
the meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations. 
the hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. among the attendees were nbcs deborah turness, lester holt and chuck todd, abcs james goldston, george stephanopoulos, david muir and martha raddatz,

"snip creó mercado negro e informal páginas libres
snip creó mercado negro e informal socios  2 de noviembre de 2016 por germán lench cáceres
2-11-2016
por fin se piensa hacer algo realista, reestructurar como sosteníamos desde esta columna, el sistema nacional de inversión pública snip que ha creado un mercado negro e informal sin sentido técnico para beneficiar la aprobación de estudios de pre inversión beneficiando estudios copiados yo mal elaborados, que son condición para que muchas oficinas de programación e inversiones del sector público a nivel del gobierno central, regional y local le otorguen viabilidad pidiendo prebendas pagos por debajo para darles pase en algunos casos.
la inversión pública complementa a la privada y se le debe acelerar, año 2014 -2.4; 2015 -2.7, esto con la finalidad de ayudar al crecimiento económico y aumentar el pbi nacional. el país requiere un shock de inversiones públicas para disminuir brechas de infraestructura y reactivar la economía.
el concepto de snip fue traído el 2000 por los tecnócratas que aún son dueños del mef y que enseñan diplomados en universidades y sobre la metodología, perdiendo el objetivo del sistema de evitar el despilfarro en los gastos de inversión del estado.
la idea con el snip era tener un sistema administrativo, utilizado para mejorar la calidad de los proyectos, a través de principios, métodos, procedimientos y normas técnicas que tienen relación con las fases de estos. con su aplicación se ha ampliado el ciclo del proyecto con la implementación de los estudios de pre inversión perfil y factibilidad lo que en algún momento exigía la pre factibilidad y se busca a eficiencia en la utilización de recursos, b sostenibilidad en la mejora de la calidad o ampliación de la provisión de los servicios relacionados a los proyectos, c mayor impacto socio-económico para la población.
la pregunta es si con la aplicación del snip se incrementó la inversión pública, o mejoró la rentabilidad para la sociedad en su conjunto con el incremento del gasto público.
una clara observación es que el snip no debió aplicarse a los proyectos de inversión pública por igual. otra es que los profesionales que se consideran expertos en formular proyectos del snip, empiezan a ofrecer sus servicios principalmente a los gobiernos regionales y lo único que cambian es la ubicación del proyecto y los análisis respectivos son los mismos cuando es sabido que cada pueblo tiene una realidad distinta. un pip que debe desarrollarse en 60 días, demora 90 días, lo terminan desarrollando en 210 días, 7 meses por la incapacidad en formular proyectos.
en el snip cuando se ha eliminado los estudios de prefactibilidad, quedando perfil y factibilidad, tampoco contribuye a agilizarlo, el año 2015 se incrementó el techo para los estudios a nivel de perfil, hasta 20 millones de soles, pero nada de lo técnico, aquí debemos ser claros, qué tipo de proyectos deben pasar la evaluación económica requerida, por ello los proyectos que tienen que ver con la producción, su mejora, ampliación, entre otros, deben pasar esta prueba, como los del sector agricultura, producción, transportes, pero no los de educación, salud, investigación, saneamiento, estos últimos pasan mucho tiempo en una evaluación interminable, siendo aprobados por cansancio, o por presiones de los políticos, pero dejando lo técnico, es necesario realizar una evaluación costo-efectividad para decidir si se hace o no una infraestructura educativa?, aquí debe primar los lineamientos de política, o los proyectos para investigación deben pasar por una evaluación beneficio costo, por eso no se aprovecha nuestra biodiversidad, pasamos más tiempo tratando de demostrar lo que es evidente para intervenir, por ello algo del puede ser necesario para proyectos relacionados a la producción.
con la aplicación del snip tal como está, no se ha incrementado la inversión pública, y no se ha mejorado la rentabilidad para la sociedad en su conjunto con el incremento del gasto público.
actualmente hay baja eficiencia en la inversión pública y lo hubo antes del snip, pero este sistema se utilizó únicamente para frenar el gasto público y generar un superávit fiscal.
el sistema que se implante no debe facilitar la corrupción, ni tener tufo populista. como decía un profesor, el bypass nunca se hubiera hecho, si hubiese habido el snip.
es hora de reestructurar este instrumento de control cuasi colonial que impone el mef al resto de la administración pública.

the concert, run by the renowned dresden symphony orchestra, was scheduled to take place on november 13 in the german consulate in istanbul. read more german parliament acknowledges armenian genocide amid intense turkish pressure 
called aghet or catastrophe in armenian, the performance was to commemorate the victims of the 1915 massacre that left around 1.5 million armenians dead and hundreds of thousands forced to flee. 
turkish president recep erdogan was personally invited to attend the event by the orchestra, along with other top turkish politicians, including prime minister binali yildirim and foreign minister melvut cavusoglu, german t-online news outlet reports , citing dpa news agency, which gained access to copies of the invitations. 
the invitations were made despite erdogan taking a hard stance against germanys recognition of the armenian genocide  even threatening germany with some response measures. 
the concert was cancelled by berlin. on wednesday, the german foreign office said that the premises in the istanbul consulate are not available on november 13th, according to deutsche welle. 
later in the day, orchestra director markus rindt said he received notification from the ministry with nearly the same content. 
its definitely been canceled. they said they wanted to reschedule at a better time, but when would that be? this has been planned for years, rindt told reuters. 
the piece by the dresden symphony orchestra includes musicians from turkey, armenia, germany, and the former yugoslavia. it premiered last year in berlin with additional performances scheduled in belgrade on november 5 and in the armenian capital of yerevan on november 10. read more germany says armenia genocide resolution non-binding after reports berlin keen to satisfy turkey 
the aghet has become one of several stumbling blocks in troubled turkey-germany relations. in april, the turkish ambassador to the eu demanded that the bloc stop funding the project which received initial support from the european commissions executive agency for education, audiovisual and culture. 
on june 2, 2016, the german parliament almost unanimously passed a symbolic resolution recognizing the 1915 massacre of armenians by ottoman turkish forces as genocide. the move was praised by armenia and sharply criticized by turkey, which even tried to pressure germany ahead of the vote. 
following the move, ankara recalled its ambassador to germany, while erdogan said that the government would discuss response measures. 
the mass killings began on april 24, 1915, when 250 armenian intellectuals were detained by ottoman authorities and later executed in constantinople, present-day istanbul. most of the ottoman empires armenians were then displaced, deported, or placed in concentration camps on the pretext of rebelling and siding with russia in world war i. up to 1.5 million armenians were affected by these measures.

according to the associated press , it turns out that donald trumps wife melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the united states when she first arrived from her native slovenia. melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitors visa, known as a b1b2 visa. this occurred on august 27, 1996. melania did not get a legal work visa until october 18, 1996. during the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of 20,000. she got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. 
so, in other words, melania trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. melania said, in part, in her stump speech 
as a young entrepreneur, i wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. so of course, i came here. living and working in america was a true blessing, but i wanted something more. i wanted to be an american. 
well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that melania trump wasnt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. the information obtained by the ap include, but are not limited to, her contract from metropolitan international management  a modeling agency. also, theres the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows melania working during the time when she had the visitors visa, but no work visa. it seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up melanias wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. this would be why melania trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the united states and her eventual path to citizenship. while it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. you can read more here at the associated press . 
the long and short of it is this donald trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the other. namely, immigrants. that is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didnt completely comply with immigration law. hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.

"trumps new defense strategy on access hollywood tape blame the microphone thu, oct 27th, 2016 at 902 pm it's amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidate's troubles. share on twitter print this post 
in an interview with bill oreilly on thursday, donald trump was again asked about the access hollywood tape in which the republican nominee was caught bragging about sexually assaulting women. this time, though, he put up a new defense strategy, at least when it comes to this particular issue  blame the microphone. 
when asked by oreilly if he thinks he would be winning the election if not for the release of the video, trump once again repeated that it was only locker room talk, and then started complaining that a microphone shouldnt have been allowed to capture his comments. 
shockingly, he did not express any regrets for his language.

it was locker room talk. the microphone was not supposed to be on  it was an illegal act that was nbc. it was not supposed to be on that was a private dressing room. 
its amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidates troubles. 
it should also be noted that trumps complaint about his dressing room privacy being breached is particularly rich given his history of storming into the dressing rooms of teenage pageant contestants, some as young as 15 years old. 
when asked by oreilly if he would take legal action against nbcs role in uncovering and releasing the tape, trump said, youll see. 
all of this comes after trump recently promised to sue the growing number of women who have come forward saying that they were sexually assaulted by him. 
trump also spent an absurd amount of time in the interview complaining that the media is rigged not true, voter fraud is widespread false, and the polls are dirty theyre not. 
even in the right-wing safe haven that is fox news, donald trump still managed to prove himself as dangerously unfit to be president.",133,736265,real

"4-year old russian girl speaks 7 languages. how did she do this? education , children , rbth daily bella devyatkina source rossia one tv channel 
earlier this month bella instantly became famous thanks to ""amazing people,"" a show on the russian television. the video with the girl answering questions, singing songs and talking about herself in different languages went viral. 
""compared with this child, i feel like an idiot,"" users wrote in the comments section. 
video by youtube 
yulia devyatkina, bella's mother, said her daughter is not a child prodigy; they just invested a lot of time and effort in her development. ""not every child needs to speak six languages, but any kid can master two or three,"" the mother said. 
bella's parents understand that their daughter will not be using all these languages in every day life. 
""when school starts we will focus on english, french and chinese,"" the mother said. ""we also don't worry that bella will not be interested in her classes. she has the same knowledge that any four-year-old child should have, but she is able to discuss these topics in different languages."" french baby talk 
bella's mom is a linguist and has been teaching english to children for seven years. her father works at the radio research and development institute based in moscow. the family has an average income, but the parents decided that their daughter's development is their main priority. italian polyglot to understand russians you must speak russian 
initially, the parents wanted bella to speak english like a native speaker, and the mother spoke with bella in english and russian from birth, alternating every other day. she made sure that the languages were not mixed, not allowing the girl to insert russian words during a conversation in english. 
when bella was 10-month-old, her parents added french. she could not talk but could point her finger at things when adults referred to them. bella mastered reading even before she began to talk, and her parents taught this using special cards from the age of five months. for example, when ten-month-old bella was shown the word ""hand"" written in russian or english, she showed her little hand. by the age of one, she and her parents mastered 60 such cards. bella began to read easily at the age of two. chinese cartoons 
by the age of two bella learned to speak in short sentences and read fluently in three languages. when she was just under three, her parents added chinese to her program. according to the mother, bella showed great interest in the new language, and she asked to watch cartoons in chinese. 
at the age of three years and two months, little bella showed an interest in learning spanish and german, as well as dancing, violin and vocals. then arabic was also added. bella walks, plays hide and seek, and reads ordinary books for children  she just does it in different languages. all her classes are held in the form of a game. 
the parents organize small educational excursions with native speakers for bella, she also attends an english theater club, studies drawing in french, dancing in spanish, and attends figure skating lessons with a native german speaker. in addition, the parents regularly organize joint language classes for bella and her friends who are also brought up in a multilingual environment. brain power 
scientists confirm that the ability to speak in different languages, and switch from one to the other, depends on the interaction of different areas of the brain. they are activated depending on the language's phonetic characteristics, its grammatical system, imagery and even tonality. 
""every new experience is reflected in the brain by the emergence of new nerve connections,"" said psychologist tatyana dyachenko. ""the hippocampus, responsible for memory, stimulates the growth of new neurons. the volume of certain parts of the brain literally grows.'' 
""multilingualism has a positive effect on a child's overall development, though it may cause a lag in the development of speech at an early stage in comparison with children who grow up with only one language,"" said kira ivanova, an expert at the institute of linguistic studies ils in the russian academy of sciences. 
early training, however, does not guarantee that the child will be fluent in the language in the future.

"the media ignores the good news on climate change by rmuse on thu, oct 27th, 2016 at 1036 am to avoid climate-ending global temperature rise, it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy sources. share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by r muse 
over the past few months, there has been a dearth of good news, and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical american election. where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change. even dismissing the horrible flooding, wildfires, droughts, sea level rise, melting ice caps, hurricanes and worldwide food shortages, there have only been dire reports on the level of co2 permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly record-setting rise in global temperatures. 
this week, while most americans were living, breathing and bleeding over donald trump and the tortuously-long presidential campaign, the international energy agency offered up some good news; for the climate, the earths population, and even for america. 
the good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on tuesday by the international energy agency iea that stated according to new data, for the first time renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world. 
it may not seem like such fantastic news, but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climate-ending 2-degree c rise in global temperatures, it is critical for the world to transition off of carbon-producing fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy generating sources. this is particularly true for getting off dirty coal-fired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of americas c02 emissions. carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming. 
the iea report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly two-thirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in, and coming from, developing and industrialized nations alike. for a developing nation, it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuel-generated power sources whether they are dirty coal-fired plants or not-quite-as-dirty natural gas-burning generating plants. 
the iea also revised its earlier projections for renewable energys continued expansion and growth and  significantly increased the amount of  green energy  it expects to  come on line  over the next five years. renewable energy includes so-called green sources such as biomass, biogas, eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources, according to the environmental protection agency epa. both terms, renewable and green energy, include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable. 
in addition to pro-renewable policies such as the paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the america-china deal to roll back coal-generated emissions, there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables; particularly in solar. and, the iea projected that the worldwide costs for solar-generated power will continue declining by an additional 25 percent over the next five years. onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another 15 percent during that same five-year period. 
although the iea report was incredibly good news for the entire planet, there was some extra good news in the report about americas transition to renewable energy. according to the ieas medium-term renewable market report, the united states is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing. what that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the ever-increasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity. still, america has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of americas electricity. 
in time and if the koch brothers allow it, america may catch up to still-developing nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources. industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy. 
although there appears to be no down-side in this bit of good news, the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications. the dirty coal industry is facing some struggles in part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices, financial mismanagement, and new clean-air regulations, but the amount of co2 driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity. it is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs. 
the iea couldnt pass up the chance to note one sticking point in their otherwise encouraging report;  persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy  that renewables are not affecting. however, since the iea only monitored and tracked the worlds transistor from oil and gas to biofuels, they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world, they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener, significantly cheaper, and one hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people. 
it is a mystery how republicans beholden to the koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry, particularly the dirty coal industry, will absorb this good news. in the past eight years, republicans , the kochs, their lobbyists at the heritage foundation, americans for prosperity, and the american legislative exchange council alec have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals. it is likely that the ieas report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome. but now that more americans are benefitting from renewable energy, particularly solar, republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the sun and saving the climate for their childrens future; something the ieas report never mentions.

mass culture, because it speaks to us in easily digestible clichés and stereotypes, reinforces ignorance, bigotry and racism. it promotes our individual and collective self-glorification. it sanctifies nonexistent national virtues. it takes from us the intellectual and linguistic tools to separate illusion from truth. it is all show business all the time.

there are hundreds of millions of americans who know that something is terribly wrong. a light has gone out. they see it in their own suffering and hopelessness and the suffering and hopelessness of their neighbors. but they lack, because of the contamination of our political, cultural and intellectual discourse, the words and ideas to make sense of what is happening around them. they are bereft of a vision. austerity, globalization, unfettered capitalism, an expansion of the extraction of fossil fuels and endless war are not the price to be paid for progress and the advance of civilization. they are part of the savage and deadly exploitation by corporate capitalism and imperialism. they serve a neoliberal ideology . the elites dare not speak this truth. it is toxic. they peddle the seductive illusions that saturate the airwaves. we are left to strike out at shadows. we are enticed to succumb to the racism, allure of white supremacy and bigotry that always accompanies a culture in dissolution. 
we cannot, for this reason, discount the possibility that donald trump will be elected president. the election outcome will be decided by whatever emotion americans feel when they cast their ballots. 
celebrity narratives, manufactured pseudo-drama, sex scandals, natural disasters, insults and invective, mass shootings and war flash before us in a constant jumble of images on ubiquitous screens. the assault of images obliterates reality. a former congressman who sends a picture of himself in underwear to a woman is a national news story. sober examinations of our economic, foreign, judicial and environmental policies are dismissed as too complicated and boring. it does not produce engaging images. the electronic medias sole goal is to attract viewers and advertising dollars. it has conditioned us to demand an endless vaudeville act. 
we are infected because of this mass indoctrination by what daniel boorstin in  the image  a guide to pseudo-events in america calls social narcissism. the bottomless narcissism of trump and bill and hillary clinton cater to this social narcissism. they reflect back to us our desperate longing for, as well as celebration of, entertainment, celebrity, wealth, power and self-aggrandizement. it is not only advertising and public relations, as boorstin points out, that carries out the incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social narcissism. journalists, book publishers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, positive psychologists, self-help gurus, the christian right and talk show hosts all feed the mania for illusion. they all chant the insane mantra that reality is never an impediment to what we desire. we can have anything we want if we work hard, get an education, believe in ourselves, grasp that we are exceptional and believe the impossible is always possible. it is magical thinking. and magical thinking is the only real commodity the elites have left offer to us. make american great again. or america already is great. take your pick of idiotic clichés. 
we tyrannize and frustrate ourselves by expecting more than the world can give us or than we can make of the world, boorstin writes. we demand that everyone who talks to us, or writes for us, or takes pictures for us, or makes merchandise for us, should live in our world of extravagant expectations. we expect this even of the peoples of foreign countries. we have become so accustomed to our illusions that we mistake them for reality. we demand them. and we demand that there be always more of them, bigger and better and more vivid. 
the incessant search for instant gratification and the most appealing image, including the image of ourselves we manufacture for others on social media, has robbed us of the ability to examine ourselves and our society. it has extinguished the truth. the terminal decline of the american empire, the utter incompetence of our elites to manage everything from the ecosystem to the economy and foreign policy, the climate crisis, along with the widespread poverty and despair that defines over half of america, do not fit with the illusion. so these realities are blotted from public consciousness. the poor are rendered invisible. the climate crisis is ignored. the foreign policy debacles will be fixed with more bombs. a culture that can no longer discern or confront reality is unable to reform itself and dies. only the soviet and fascist dictatorships, along with the medieval catholic church, controlled thought as effectively.",207,736268,fake
"paintings 'almost no one else seemed to be doing' print 
when judith gait met father x, it was a lopsided grief that drew them together. he had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. gait is a married mother of five, and long-term american resident in britain. her support of the pro-life movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her christian faith. 
witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead, gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. subtle and working entirely with symbolism, these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. rather, they mourn in color, symbol and tone with single shoes, broken cord, dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait, commentary by father x 
when a friend first visited gaits studio, he was struck by her abortion paintings. confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child, he wrote i realize your work comes from a place of great love, for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture. 
gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child. it happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby, five years to the day. father x remembers every detail. 
their conversation grew into a joint effort, culminating in a book,  troubadours sailing hibiscus seas meditations on post abortion trauma . father x wanted to remain anonymous, as a place-setter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. he wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of gaits 30 paintings in this book, which have also been shown together in art exhibits. 
time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion, gait claims. rather, the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence, guilt and remorse has not abated. you can see that in the words of father x, which run the gamut of human emotions. on abortion shoe, pot and crossesfrom troubadours sailing hibiscus seas 
jonah of nineveh features an upended, single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. flowers are already in the birth position, head down and waiting to be born. torn and shroud-like ribbons hang across the painting. spirals represent a childs dna helix and the veil of the temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation. father x makes an analogy between jonah fleeing parental responsibility and eventual redemption  then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness it was her wedding dress, my sea green empress, this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. she was full of fear.  
in some of these works, hammers incongruently hang with flowers. they are bloody or blackened, some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. father x interprets these tools as decision markers, to either build or tear down. in hammer of decision, it belongs to thor, the war god infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction. wagner, the olympics, sperm races, thomas moore and valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. either the carpenters hammer of wisdom or thors tool of chaos will be chosen by expectant parents. hammer, suspended 
 troubadours  runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion, the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. this includes moonlighting for angels, celestial games, interstellar wind-jammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas, among other delightful prospects. lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their limbos. 
father x occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters, these are not theological statements, but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. 
in gaits pink rose and stardust, we see empty fields, withered plants and other tokens. father x takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children. he places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles, which is reflected in the painting. children are disfigured, or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents. music is intense, equivalent to the sound created by hildegard von bingen a 12th-century nun and composer. troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait, commentary by father x 
references to mary as a mother are common, as well as other scriptural allusions. all babies jump for jesus in the womb or in its sack of nibbling yoke writes father x. elizabeths child john leapt for joy, just as his ancestor david did before the ark of the covenant, he continues. 
gait addresses the human embryo, finding biblical, ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. her abbey target beginning has a crosshair target, which is interpreted spiritually the first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread  the bread on fire with the holy spirit the same stage of development as the child in marys womb when she arrived at her cousin elizabeths house. 
post-abort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed, but emotionally reacted to in art and word. father x describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals. this contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds. at another point, father-x imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus, a roar of unwanted thoughts. troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait, commentary by father x 
father x elaborates on what gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion. he cites a world built on slavery before christs advent, and the works of such men as william wilberforce and john brown in furthering christs gospel of justice and peace. all this is contrasted to abortion throughout. 
ruminating on gaits palms of our lord, father x claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. palms is murky, with a single, red hand print. to look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the tarot of ruins, he continues. 
suicide advances this dark theme, where gait and father x criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics. he takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings  a caricature of a woman who made a mistake, who got herself in trouble, who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart. 
but all isnt baleful and sad here. in cloud children, father x muses on paper dolls in gaits paintings with this lovely thought where children go  is a mystery.  some say they take their daytime rest in christs tomb in jerusalem, and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled star ships. 
 troubadours sailing hibiscus seas  is a work of meditation, grief counseling, poetry, social commentary and visual art. father x may not reveal his identity here, but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. gait and father x describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families, those phantoms of sorrows, who will never laugh or cry together as a family, because of an abortion. they hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way. 
judith gait is a graduate of california college of arts and crafts and received a masters at oxfords ruskin school of fine drawing. her work is in public and private collections in america and abroad. she is an american citizen, residing in britain. father x is an addictions counselor and writer in great britain, who prefers to remain anonymous.

"a republican election official just blocked door, demanded early voters shut up, go home! comments 
a republican election commissioner and volunteer poll watcher has been accused of voter intimidation after he tried to drive away voters from an early-voting polling place in pine bluff, arkansas. the man, stu soffer, is a prominent trump supporter who serves on the election commission of the majority-black jefferson county. he has been the subject of national scrutiny before, most notably when he brandished a gun at an election commission meeting this spring and then followed it up with quid-pro-quo corruption over the summer. 
now, soffer is facing suit in the local circuit court after jefferson county clerk patricia johnson and unrelated pine bluff voter victor johnson accused him of interfering with and intimidating voters at the jefferson county courthouse on october 24. according to attorney chris burks, who is representing mr. johnson, soffer stood in the doorway of the early voting location and told voters to shut up and go home. 
johnson states in his filings that he was waiting in line at the polling place when soffer entered with a tv reporting crew. when a county sheriff told soffer that the tv crew was causing a disturbance and ordered one of its members to leave, soffer apparently blocked the door to the voting booths and yelled at the assembled citizens to shut up and go home. the suit filed by mr. johnson states that, as a result of the disruption caused by stu soffer and other republicans i was not able to cast my ballot that day. dozens of other likely voters were apparently turned away in similar fashion. 
soffer resigned his position as a poll watcher in the aftermath of the incident, but the suit filed on behalf of mr. johnson is seeking to have him removed from his position on the county election commission as well. soffer refused to comment when contacted by local publication arkansas online and a hearing date is yet to be set for the case. 
this admittedly localized incident comes against a backdrop of a massive campaign of voter suppression targeting minority communities that is underway across the nation , usually justified by the chimera of voter fraud . republican officials and commissioners, knowing that trumps bigoted rhetoric will cost them the election in any fair vote, are using every dirty trick in the book to suppress minority turnout in a campaign of intimidation that a federal judge in north carolina rightly characterized as insane and like something that was put together in 1901.",125,736273,fake

"rachel maddow shines the light on trumps white supremacist support by hrafnkell haraldsson   904 am the kkk newspaper features the front page full page story ""make america great again"" with a big featured center photo of donald trump   
rachel maddow traces the history of the post-civil war enforcement acts signed by president ulysses s. grant, including the ku klux klan act , or the enforcement act of 1871 17 stat. 13, which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters. 
to show that the klan act is not vestigial but very much relevant in this election, maddow points to the citation of this law by the democrat party in a whole raft of lawsuits in nevada, arizona, pennsylvania and ohio alleging voter intimidation. 
maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway, the significance of the klan act is that it prohibits conspiracy to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for president or vice president, or as a member of congress of the united states. 
as an example of the role the kkk plays in trumps campaign, maddow produced the kkks newspaper of today, which bills itself as the political voice of white christian america, which, you might note, is identical with fox news demographic. this paper, she says, has been turning up on front lawns in the great state of georgia. 
watch courtesy of msnbc discussion begins at 915 mark 
tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development. this is the newspaper of the ku klux klan today. its the crusader, the political voice of white christian america. the premier voice of white resistance. theyve got  you see the white power symbol there in the upper right-hand corner? theyve got a whole media operation going on apparently. watch white pride tv, listen to kkk radio 24 hours a day. this newsletter is about 12 pages long, features articles on the threat of nonwhite immigration, a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people. theres an article by the founder of the america first party which is all about the terrorist jews. he brags in his byline that hes the man who david duke credits for awakening him to the threat of jewish supremacism. its exactly what you would think from the ku klux klan newspaper. if you knew there was a ku klux klan newspaper these days. but the front page full page story is make america great again with a big featured center photo of donald trump. its one of several articles in the paper about trump, including this in-set article about how trumps candidacy is moving the dialogue forward.  those are a couple of the many, many robocalls that were made during the republican primary campaign on behalf of donald trumps candidacy, calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the american national super pac. the trump campaign doesnt appear to have anything to do with these calls. they reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a trump donor. it was further embarrassing to the trump campaign when this guy, this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls, he was initially picked to be a trump delegate to the republican convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported. 
donald trumps white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a white homeland and that, of necessity, the united states must be this white homeland. as maddow has pointed out in the past, and by their own admission, their eugenics insanity is now out in the open because of donald trump. 
dont believe maddow? demographics pro looked at 10,000 donald trump twitter supporters and found that more than one third follow white nationalist twitter accounts. 
the fact is, trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it, brought it into his own movement, which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white working-class americans, whatever the mainstream media tells you.

without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. he simply said put on a suit and meet me outside, and closed the door, melker wrote. 
donald jr. was a drunk in college. every memory i have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking, he continued. he absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. his nickname was diaper don, because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other peoples beds and urinate. i always felt terrible for him, he continued. 
mekler said part of his reason for voting for hillary clinton is because in light of what i saw that day, it is clear to me that donald trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.

"carbon tax reversal in washington state carbon tax reversal in washington state november 12, 2016 
exclusive washington states rejection of a modest carbon tax  opposed by some environmentalists for not being larger  marks a reversal for what could have been a model for the u.s., writes jonathan marshall. 
by jonathan marshall 
even as voters nationally elected a notorious climate denier as their next president, several environmental groups rallied to help defeat a ballot measure in the state of washington that would have taxed carbon emissions. it was an historic missed opportunity that should provoke serious reflection about realistic strategies for fighting global warming. 
with the possible exception of the rising threat of nuclear war , no issue facing humanity is more urgent than climate change. yet the worlds second largest carbon polluter, the united states, has consistently failed to take tough national measures to curb its emissions, owing to fierce resistance by the fossil-fuel industry and its conservative allies. although most americans believe climate change is real, they are easily spooked into inaction by warnings of higher energy costs or job losses. graphic on the greenhouse effect at the environmental protection agencys web site 
thats why initiative 732 on washingtons ballot was so important it offered a plausible way to bring skittish taxpayers and businesses on board the climate action train by addressing their concerns about the economic costs of environmental remedies. 
the 2 billion carbon tax proposal, modeled on a successful tax in neighboring british columbia , offered a carrot-and-stick approach to effect change. rising gradually over time, it would have added about 25 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline and roughly two cents per kilowatt-hour to the price of electricity generated from fossil fuels. most consumers would have found those sticks motivating but not crippling. 
the carrots in the measure were a 1 percent cut in the states regressive sales tax, near elimination of business taxes for manufacturing to protect jobs, and tax rebates of up to 1,500 for hundreds of thousands of low-income households. through revenue neutrality  giving back the money it raised  the initiative aimed to quiet anti-tax activists. and targeting so many of the benefits to people of modest means, it beat the usual rap that higher energy costs fall hardest on those who can least afford them. 
tax endorsements 
charles komanoff, new york-based director of the carbon tax center, called the washington proposal fantastic, saying, i think its really fair and smart. 
the proposal also won over influential harvard economist greg mankiw, former chair of president george w. bushs council of economic advisers, who said im hopeful that it would become a model for other states, and indeed nationwide. . . . this kind of thing is really the model for where climate policy needs to go in the coming years. 
many economists believe that using market prices rather than command-and-control regulations to influence energy choices will ultimately achieve the most bang for the buck. 
the initiative also won the endorsement of the audubon society, famed climate scientist james hansen, dozens of scientists at the university of washington, and climate activist leonard dicaprio. 
on the other side, not surprisingly, the measure earned the militant opposition of koch industries, other petrochemical companies and a major utility. they spent more than a million dollars to kill the initiative. 
much more surprisingly, the fossil-fuel lobby was joined in opposition, or non-endorsement, by sierra club, union of concerned scientists, washington environmental council, and several other environmental, social justice and health advocacy groups. by dividing the environmental movement, they helped cut the yes vote to 42 percent. 
their chief concern the initiative didnt raise taxes enough or mandate more spending on renewable energy development, mass transit, affordable housing and community programs. they let their liberal-progressive ideas of the perfect be the enemy of what one mit energy economist called by far the most aggressive u.s. proposal hes ever seen. 
perfect as enemy of good 
opponents did raise legitimate issues, such as whether the initiative set the carbon tax high enough to fully pay for the tax rebates. critics also questioned , with reason, whether the drafters studied attempts to win over businesses and conservatives would actually produce results. oil billionaires david and charles koch. 
but some of the criticism was hyperbolic. naomi shock doctrine klein, for example, smeared the carbon tax initiative as right-wing friendly and the policy choice of big polluters. she further denounced it as a disastrous precedent that could set back the climate justice movement for a decade, apparently because it would not immediately jumpstart an urgent, sweeping phase-out of fossil fuels or deliver the massive green energy investments and community-driven solutions we all need. 
klein and other hard-liners fail to acknowledge some basic truths. first, even voters in liberal washington may be reticent to approve huge new tax-and-spend programs. second, slamming residents with really high carbon taxes would ensure the premature death of any such program. a modest carbon tax can be raised over time once voters are reassured that it doesnt cost jobs or pinch their wallets excessively. 
moreover, purists ignore the fact that a more radical program in washington, even if approved, would have no direct impact on global warming. the contribution of any one state to the global pool of carbon emissions is minuscule. only broad, collective action ultimately matters. 
where a state like washington can make a difference is by showcasing a model approach with broad appeal. a successful and popular carbon tax in washington might convince other states and other countries to follow suit, just as british columbias successful tax is now spreading across canada . thats why koch industries and other fossil-fuel interests spent so much to defeat it. 
environmentalists who denigrate anything short of super-progressive policies are living in a thick bubble. in an age when the media barely even acknowledge the existence of climate change, and when voters elect donald trump president, we need creative new approaches to combating climate change.

kadzik led the effort to nominate loretta lynch, who famously met with bill clinton on her private plane right before hillarys interrogation about emailgate.  source  we all knew that the clinton foundation was just a way for the clinton family to launder money, and now theres proof. zero hedge writes, todays wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the clinton foundation, bands firm teneo consulting, and the clinton familys private business endeavors. a pundit called this leak the rosetta stone of the clinton foundation, meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated.  source  clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because shed be without one. and this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case  surprisingly it isnt related to her health.  source  the leaks also show that clinton intends to do her best to restrict the second amendment. brian fallon, the national press secretary for the clinton campaign, wrote,  circling back around on guns as a follow up to the friday morning discussion the today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as president  universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability . according to an analysis on the daily sheeple, imposing manufacturer liability means that after sandy hook, bushmaster and remington arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.  source  the campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of bill clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, bill cosby . political operative ron klain sent an urgent email saying that hillary should anticipate the following questions,  how is what bill clinton did different from what bill cosby did? is his conduct relevant to your campaign? you said every woman should be believed. why not the women who accused him? will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?  source  clintons campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad bernie sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by wall street. perez hilton wrote,  bernie sanders lounges at elite marthas vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from wall street lobbyists .  source  clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to goldman-black rock in 2014. and i am not taking a position on any policy, but i do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. and i never had that feeling when i was growing up. never. i mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. my father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. we had good public schools. we had accessible health care. we had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didnt believe in mortgages. so i lived that. and now, obviously, im kind of far removed because the life ive lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and i now enjoy , but i havent forgotten it.  source  she made this rather nwo remark at a 2013 paid speech to brazilian bank banco itau  my dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.  source  in a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the jewish united fund of metropolitan chicago in 2013, clinton said that jordan and turkey  cant possibly vet all those refugees so they dont know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees. meanwhile, if clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes obamas 10,000 a year look like small potatoes.  source  clinton blackmailed the chinese by telling them that the us would base missiles in the region if they didnt exert some control over north korean aggression.  so china, come on. you either control them or were going to have to defend against them , she purportedly told the audience at a goldman sachs conference in june 2013.  source  in may 2015, clinton was no longer secretary of state but was ready to announce she was running for president when she was invited to attend a summit in morrocco. the implication from the leaked emails was that a 12 million donation from the king of morocco was dependent on clinton attending the summit. human abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns .  if hrc was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. she created this mess and she knows it. her presence was a condition for the moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this, abedin wrote to robbie mook in a november 2014 email. incidentally, clinton didnt attend. bill and chelsea went instead and the 12 million donation was not forthcoming. source  podesta attacked clintons primary election rival bernie sanders for criticizing the paris climate change agreement.  can you believe that doofus bernie attacked it?  said podesta.  source  clinton told a goldman sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in syria .  my view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for americans to intervene, she told employees of the bank in south carolina, which had paid her about 225,000 to give a speech. we used to be much better at this than we are now. now, you know, everybody cant help themselves. they have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else look what were doing and i want credit for it.  source  there is indeed a definite link between the clinton campaign and what msm is allowed to say. the campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a whos who in american media  dan merica from cnn, haim saban of univision, john harwood of cnbc and the ny times, rebecca quick of cnbc, maggie haberman of ny times and politico, john harris of politico, donna brazile formerly of cnn, roland martin of tv-one, marjorie pritchard of the boston globe, and louise mensch of heat street.  source  as everyone knows, the dnc deliberately screwed bernie sanders out of the nomination  bonus wikileaks also released some of the dncs voicemails on the topic . there are emails that prove who is actually pulling hrcs puppet strings and that puppeteer is george soros . the shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory  it really exists and hillarys job is to keep george soros happy.  source  excerpts from her speeches to wall street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. in them, she clearly points out that sometimes you need to lie. if everybodys watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. so, you need both a public and a private position.  source  wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for cnn and before she became an employee of the clinton campaign, donna brazile gave hillary the questions in advance for her impromptu cnn town hall questions.  source  the campaign got to approve articles in influential publications like ny times, huffpo, cnn, nbc, cbs, nyt, msnbc, and politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from hrcs abysmal candidacy.  source  through the treasure trove of wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how hillary really feels about us all spoiler basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators  source  president obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure state department server. cheryl mills wrote to john podesta, w e need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say state.gov . you see, obamas emails all have to be fromwhitelistedaddresses. so someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist.  source  and finally, heres the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. and let me tell you, it isnt because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. emphasis mine. at the goldman sachs builders and innovators summit, clinton responded to a question from chief executive lloyd blankfein, who quipped that you go to washington to make a small fortune. clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government.  there is such a bias against people who have led successful andor complicated lives,  clinton said.  source  together, we cannot be ignored. i am on a mission between now and the presidential election on november 8th and i hope that you will join me. i am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. it isnt until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general. please join your voice with mine by liking, sharing, and spreading the word. together, we cannot be ignored. together, we are an army. article first posted at daisyluther.com submit your review",195,736268,fake

"strange silence of neo-con trolls as mikheil saakashvili stabs his patron poroshenko in the back written by mark almond   the sudden resignation of mikheil saakashvili as governor of odessa and his accompanying tirade of accusations of corruption and treason against the ukrainian president, petro poroshenko and his coterie in kiev came as a bombshell for the western media on 7th november. but it was a strangely bland bombshell. yes, the voices of the west - the bbc, cnn, the new york times, wall st. journal, radio free europeradio liberty  mentioned that the former georgian president, who had been brought in to combat corruption in ukraines key port and one of its major russian-speaking cities, had resigned, even that he criticised his patron and old university chum, poroshenko, for being on the take. but the reportage has been strangely opaque. remember both saakashvili and poroshenko had been routinely characterised as the epitome of anti-corruption campaigners by western neo-con voices whose echo-chamber is the supposedly liberal media, cnn, nbc in the usa and bbc and channel four news in the uk. no mention of poroshenkos past service to the notoriously corrupt regimes in ukraine before 2014 is permitted, nor reference to his alleged business dealings with pariahs like iran before he came on board for the regime-change of the decade in february, 2014. as for the reality that to most georgians their ex-president, president, mikheil saakashvili, was the personification of a brutal, loud-mouthed demagogue that too was passed over in silence by those who boast that they tell truth to power from the editorial suites of western newsrooms and newspapers. saakashvilis own people remember how it was exactly nine years ago on 7th november, 2007, that his western equipped para-military police smashed demonstrations against him in tbilisi with a mixture of high-tech ultra-low frequency disorientation weapons and swagger sticks and jackboots. the anniversary of lenins seizure of power ninety-nine years ago has strange fascination for saakashvili as his day for decisive coups. after his fall from power in georgia four years ago, saakashvili had become a kind of post-communist flying dutchman albeit inverted. abandoned by his dutch wife after revelations of the crudest kind of tax-payer-funded infidelities, he roamed the west trying to find sanctuary. even the usa quietly but firmly denied him a haven as revelations that underneath his glass-fronted police stations  much-vaunted in the guardian and transitions online as model reforms - secret dungeons housed torture and sexual abuse against his opponents have shattered his reputation at home and were known to insiders abroad. saakashvili has of course embarrassed his us sponsors before by launching unilateral action without consulting them and getting full permission in advance. remember how in august, 2008, he thought he could overrun south ossetia before russia could react and would earn the plaudits of the neo-cons in the west for his courageous leadership. instead, he provoked a russian backlash and the disintegration of his army. in a grand strategy worthy of mussolinis placement of his best troops in ethiopia before invading greece and libya with badly equipped conscripts, saakashvili had sent his 6,000 us-trained troops to do garrison duty in iraq for his american sponsors when he decided to provoke russia in 2008. the worthless adventure shattered saakashvilis value to the west less than a year after it had ignored his brutal suppression of opposition and had endorsed yet another rigged presidential election in his favour. ousted by even some of his ex-cronies after 2012, it was his old university contemporary, petro poroshenko, who threw a lifeline to the ex-georgian president and a slew of his ex-enforcers from georgia. rather as the old soviet communist party had deployed loyal apparatchiks from outside each republic to enforce the kremlins will on the multi-ethnic population of the ussr, so washington now backed a strategy of parachuting outsiders from other ex-soviet republics and of course the children of nazi-era emigres from ukraine itself into key positions to control the ukrainian people themselves in case they took it into their heads to take democracy seriously. the americans often overlooked the internal contradictions of this parody of comintern tactics. saakashvili was notoriously anti-armenian in power in georgia, when he bulldozed scores of ancient armenian buildings in tbilisi to make way for his reichstag-look-alike presidential palace. so it wasnt by chance that he got into a brawl with the ethnic armenian interior minister of independent ukraine last year. saakashvilis arrival in largely-russian-speaking odesa was a red rag to the locals. they resisted his attempt to massage local elections in favour of his preferred candidates for mayor and so on as he had done back home in georgia. he denounced the opposition as corrupt but at best this was the pot calling the kettle black. saakashvilis own tarnished reputation went before him across the black sea even if seminars in oxford or harvard took his credentials as mr clean at face value. now his wrestling match with the ukrainian mafia and his attempt to impose his own georgian clan in odessa has come into the open. the publication of the panama papers was supposed to tarnish vladimir putin but in reality the dirt spewed out of poroshenko for his murky caribbean cash pile. just as the revelation of david camerons family ties to offshore accounts fatally undermined his standing in the run-up to the brexit referendum. poroshenkos claims to represent westernization for ukraine were not without an ironic plausibility. then to compound poroshenkos credibility gap as an anti-corruption campaigner, an mp of soros-sponsored afghan communist background got a bill passed with american backing requiring politicians and officials to publish declarations of their wealth. the published amounts commonly enraged ordinary, poverty-stricken ukrainians even if they were often a shadow of the real wealth stashed away by the representatives of the people. having come to power by decrying viktor yanukovichs alleged orgy of corruption, the poroshenko crew looked odiously bloated with inexplicable wealth. into the scandal stepped the unpopular, alien governor odessa. despite being appointed by the president, saakashvili chose to denounce him personally for betraying the ukrainian people, western values and the anti-mafia crusade which saakashvili claimed to personify. western media express surprise at the ferocity of saakashvilis attacks on the integrity of his old university friend, poroshenko, who had rescued him from exile and given him his new lease of political life in odessa. dont these hacks remember how saakashvili had been raised up by georgias eduard shevardnadze, who became godfather to his protégés son, eduard, while he was minister of injustice in that cruelly corrupt regime, before saakashvili turned on his patron and ousted him in the so-called rose revolution in november, 2003? now thirteen unlucky years later, saakashvili has bitten the hand that fed him in ukraine. part of the western medias amnesia is of course that until yesterday both saakashvili and poroshenko were portrayed as model reformers, anti-corruption campaigners and so on. suddenly, one paragon of civic virtue smears the other. cnn, bbc and wall st. journal cant compute it. clearly, no-one in the central information agency had distributed the script in advance of this crisis  so unlike the well-signalled abandonment of a western darling like shevardnadze in 2003 or the preparations for the maidan uprising in 2013-14. then of course, the amanpours et al. were on hand with the moniker and mood music to encapsulate the propaganda line. yesterdays hero was now a villain but forget about shevardnadze or kuchma, here comes an english-speaking motor-mouth spewing out all the new world order guff about civil society, anti-corruption and, of course, russophobia. the saakashvili-porodshenko spat not only casts a garish light on the sleazy reality of western-backed regime change on either side of the black sea  georgia as well as ukraine  but more importantly it illustrates the dangerous tailspin into which the casual promotion of corrupt and unstable post-soviet politicians as paragons of civic virtue has plunged western policy in eastern europe. the recent uptick in sabre-rattling by nato reflects the bankruptcy of the political options promoted by the euro-atlantic regime-changers. having toppled and re-toppled post-communist regimes, promoting and then pulling down successive corrupt and brutal heroes of the street, the west now faces the grim reality that its reputation is as tarnished by this sleazy process as much as its former local heroes. maybe one of the youthful najibullahs of kiev will be pushed to fill the void. but dont underrate the ability of ukraines oligarchs to navigate the storms of post-communist politics and never ending flow of embarrassing revelations of hypocrisy and corruption which the dnieper can never wash away. saakashvili has declared war in a most hobbesian environment on the most powerful and odious characters in the country. above all, he has denigrated the president of ukraine himself whose authority cannot survive allowing his former protégé to abuse him with impunity. this cannot end well for both men. no-one should be surprised if saakashvili and poroshenko are suddenly reconciled, but any embrace of these two old comrades from the komsomol can only follow lenins dictum put your arms around the enemys shoulders so you get your hands closer to his throat. saakashvili may be counting on the americans to save his bacon. he seems to have forgotten what president sarkozy told him in august, 2008 the seventh cavalry is not coming over the hill to rescue you. ultimately, even the global nation par excellence does not believe that a georgian political clan can takeover ukraine and rule it for washington against the will of the ukraines own mafias. saakashvilis impulsive detonation of this crisis might lead other ukrainians to pose as champions of probity against poroshenko, but the wests international brigade of reformers who failed at home sent in to transform ukraine have had their day. some slink back home to the baltic states or chicago, but saakashvili has no homeland anymore. with his georgian citizenship revoked, and tbilisi demanding his extradition for a host of alleged crimes in office from 2003 until 2012, saakashvili has few places to run to. remember the usa wouldnt give him permanent residence which was why he jumped at the chance to serve poroshenkos bogus anti-corruption but very real anti-russian drive in odessa. with the boss-of-bosses backing in kiev, saakashvili could find himself facing extradition back to georgia  or even to russia which accused him of genocide for killing so many civilians in his madcap invasion of south ossetia in august, 2008. the west can afford to throw away saakashvili. poroshenko and his prime minister, groysman  godson of poroshenkos father  have been washingtons key allies in kiev. if they were to fall, or, if fearing washington was about to push them, they jumped ship back to their old comrades in moscow, the neo-cons house of cards in eastern europe could collapse. maybe the strange silence of the wests normally vocal media analysts about saakashvilis bombshell reflects their bewilderment that the best-laid plans for domination in the east are beginning to crumble like one of the stale cookies handed out in kiev by that pin-up for regime-change, victoria neuland. after all the hullaballoo about donald trump being the cats paw of pro-russian interests who had backed viktor yanukovich in the swirling crisis in ukraine three years ago, that none of the hacks decrying his hidden kremlin links have explained how saaki and porky poroshenko fell out so spectacularly or what it means for western grand strategy. their silence is very revealing. even googles orwellian approach to news-management has rarely been so crude the story was a bombshell, headlined with live updates  but not anymore. amnesia not analysis is increasingly the western media elites response to the crisis besetting its most cherished policies. does this silence imply retreat or will the west lash out after tuesdays us presidential election? maybe saakashvilis tantrum will set the seventh cavalry in motion, not to rescue him today any more than in 2008, but to mask the failure of regime-change with open war in the east. now that is something the western media has been talking about a lot recently. reprinted with permission from author's website . related",153,736276,fake

alligators during mating season, male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them. 
beavers the male beaver and female beaver each recite a fun fact about beavers, taking a step closer to one another as they do so. at some point, they get so close that theyre actually mating. 
elephants before having sex, the female elephant will coat her male partner in sticky, boiling hot pepsi that only comes out of her trunk when shes in the mood.

earlier this month, trump formally accepted the endorsement of the national border patrol council at trump tower in new york.
art del cueto, an official with the union who attended the event, said the obama administration is conscious of the looming election and pushing to have detainees released.

although some have criminal records, del cueto said, theyre setting them aside because at this point theyre saying immigration is so tied up with trying to get to the people that are on the waiting list, hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected, make them citizens.
why? asked trump.
so they can go ahead and vote before the election, said del cueto.
trump repeated the claim. theyre letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote, he said.
del cueto agreed.
want to hurry up and fast-track them so they can hurry up and be able to vote for these elections, hebor said.

"trump supporters didnt vote because of the economy; it was racism, and heres proof on november 13, 2016 403 pm  
post election, the media and donald trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. they are making the claim that trump wasnt elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. the problem with that argument, though, is that its simply not true. trump voters are racist and theres proof. 
the american national elections study anes began the study in january. initially, they asked how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead. now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. its very unlikely that whites arent getting jobs because minorities are, but thats not what trump voters think. the vast majority said that its extremely likely that minorities are taking jobs from white people. graph courtesy of anes and salon . 
then, they asked the same trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. despite the fact that trade was one of trumps signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. 
post election, this is what the study found 
the question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for trump over clinton. eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is extremely likely that whites cant find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is not at all likely. among white democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support trump over clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. eighty-one percent of white women who think it is extremely likely people of color are taking jobs supported trump, compared with 26 percent who dont think that. 
more than that, 78 percent of white trump supporters say black people are violent. 84 percent think that of muslims. 
unfortunately, democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. it turns out their children are just as bad. sean mcelwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this 
democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. a multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. as ive shown with political scientist jason mcdaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. the solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising american electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. 
great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots claims go unchallenged.

"can any u.s. president ever overcome the power of the establishment and bring substantive change to america? opednews op eds 10282016 at 101527 can any u.s. president ever overcome the power of the establishment and bring substantive change to america? license dmca we're finally approaching the end of this long, drawn-out, and very boring process of electing this country's next president. millions upon millions of americans are backing either hillary clinton or donald trump in the hope that she or he will bring long-awaited, substantive change to this government and this country. they have been waiting, fervently hoping to finally see some individual who possesses great courage, strong leadership skills, and a deep sense of ethics and morals, become president; and to use the power of the presidency to take this country in an entirely new direction, with a government that adheres to the will of the people. unfortunately, it doesn't look like either of the two current candidates possesses those qualities and characteristics in abundance sometime in the future we may see such an individual emerge. what kind of real substantive change am i talking about? well in the latter half of the 20 th century we saw major accomplishments made during the tenures of various presidents, such as sending a man to the moon, together with important advancements in medicine, science and technology, as well as the creation and development of the internet. those were very significant achievements but not the kind of substantive changes that greatly impacted the direction of this country. the kind of change of which i speak would be more like the enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 or the creation of the medicare and medicaid health care systems in 1965; and in years past, the social security system. here's the type of change this country and society needs as we navigate the 21 st century. first and foremost we need to see very ambitious governmentbusiness efforts and programs to create millions jobs for americans. that would help greatly to reinvigorate the middle class and jumpstart our sluggish economy; it would also result in significant reductions in the number of americans who are dependent on food stamps and other forms of government welfare. - advertisement - such a program should include the repair and modernization of our deteriorating national infrastructure, the development of solar and wind power, and the creation of a universal health care system that would finally cover all americans at much lower costs. we need substantive changes in the way we deal with rampant violence in this country; this problem has been escalating and its way past time that something were done to curtail the proliferation and illegal use of guns that are slaughtering far too many of our innocent fellow americans. but so far the government and, in particular, this congress, has refused to address this situation because of the power wielded by the gun industry and the nra. that continued governmental vacillation combined with nra obstructive tactics must not be allowed to continue. a large majority of americans would like to see real, substantive changes such as those identified above put into effect; and all of them are clearly doable. however, that's just not happening because there is a massive, seemingly immovable object standing in the way. that object of obstruction is, of course, the establishment, which is diametrically opposed to any such progress because its own objectives clash with those of the people. it is very difficult and virtually impossible for any president to overcome the power of this establishment because of what i refer to as the circle of power and control that exists in washington; here's how this ultra-powerful, self-perpetuating circle operates; - advertisement - at the seat of this power is corporate america which uses monumental amounts of  to influence and control our elections so that a large majority of elected senators and representatives return to the congress time and again; not to advance the needs of the people but, rather, the interests and objectives of corporate america. we might refer to these politicians as indentured servants. the corporatists want to slash corporate taxes to further increase profits, to significantly water down the regulations and restrictions on the banking industry., they support the lobbyists and special interest groups that have infiltrated this congress and are, not only greatly influencing the enactment of legislation, but are often actually writing it. congress has, as a very top priority, the ongoing funding of the massive military-industrial complex, i.e., the pentagon, the cia, the state and ""defense"" departments, and the defense industry corporations which produce the machinery of war. too many taxpayer dollars that should be used to strengthen this country's deteriorating foundations are, instead, directed to the military establishment to maintain its huge empire of bases and installations all over the world, to conduct invasions and occupations of other nations, and to remove elected leaders andor dictators in various countries.",127,736265,fake
"obamacare architect says its working as designed! print 
many look at the new healthcare system with their higher premiums and wonder what has happened. why are their coverages shrinking and their premiums growing? some have come to the conclusion that the system itself is to blame. they believe that obamacare is broken? 
what they fail to recognize is that this is not the case at all. what we see as failing to make insurance better has made it worse, but it is simply a problem of ignorance. we just are not smart enough to know the truth. higher premiums and less coverage is the point, it seems. 
breitbart reports  
on wednesdays broadcast of cnn newsroom, mit economics professor and obamacare architect jonathan gruber argued that the law is working as designed. however, it could work better. and i think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty. 
gruber said, obamacares not imploding. the main goal of obamacare was two-fold. one was to cover the uninsured, of which weve covered 20 million, the largest expansion in american history. the other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under obamacare. 
so basically, everything that is being reported is not accurate. there is no reason to think that all of the insurers are bailing like rats on a sinking ship. it just appears that way. this is little more that fools hope so that there will not be a mass exit from the exchange. 
but, unfortunately, people no longer demand proof. they simply take a man like this at his word. so, he will get away with telling chicken little that the sky is not falling; even while it is coming down on his head. 
when you chase emptiness, god will let you catch it.

"will it be representative government or thugocracy? will it be representative government or thugocracy? exclusive erik rush envisions clinton using high court 'as a bludgeon' against liberty published 15 mins ago erik rush about   archive erik rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare. his latest book is ""negrophilia from slave block to pedestal - america's racial obsession."" in 2007, he was the first to give national attention to the story of sen. barack obama's ties to militant chicago preacher rev. jeremiah wright, initiating a media feeding frenzy. erik has appeared on fox news' ""hannity and colmes,"" cnn, and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances. print 
 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. for me, that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights, on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community, that will stand up and say no to citizens united, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather, her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics, rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. ms. clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country, and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however, was representative of this tactic. 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively, women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the lgbt community accounts for less than 5 percent of the american population, clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values, primarily christians. leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada. a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the u.s. at least not at present; however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil. hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, citizens united, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists. even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark, unaccountable money, the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood, with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros, the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america, someone with whom the clintons also have a long association. 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like. her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely. despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media, there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. 
in recent days, weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected, from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign, the democratic national committee and the white house. 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. what all americans  not just voters, and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. 
the burning question is this in the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?

"the ruthlessly effective rebranding of europes new far right the ruthlessly effective rebranding of europes new far right sasha polakow-suransky, guardian, november 1, 2016 
in april 2002, jean-marie le pen stunned all of europe by defeating the socialist candidate, lionel jospin, in the first round of the french presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. terrified by the prospect of a far-right victory, the french leftincluding communists, greens and the socialist partythrew their support behind the incumbent president, jacques chirac , a pillar of the centre-right establishment who had served as mayor of paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. this electoral strategy effectively isolated le pens front national fn, depicting it as a cancerous force in the french body politic. 
two weeks later, on 5 may, chirac won the election with an astronomical 82 of the vote, trouncing le pen by the biggest margin in a french presidential election since 1848. raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of paris. we have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the countrybut tonight france has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic, chirac declared in his victory speech . then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the place de la république, he lauded them for rejecting intolerance and demagoguery. 
but may 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of european nations was controlled by large establishment parties. 
jean-marie le pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as chirac. he was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old catholic right. in other words, he was a familiar villainand his ideology represented an archaic france, a defeated past. moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it; his role was to be a rabble-rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate. 
europes new far right is different. from denmark to the netherlands to germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade-and-a-half, and they are casting a much wider net than jean-marie le pen ever attempted to. and by deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites, they are rapidly broadening their base. 
le pens own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right unlike her incendiary father, marine le pen is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win upwards of 40 of the vote in regions from calais in the north to the côte dazur in the south. she and her danish and dutch counterparts are notas some on the left would like to believeneo-nazis or inconsequential extremists with fringe ideas lacking popular appeal. 
these parties have built a coherent ideology and steadily chipped away at the establishment parties hold on power by pursuing a new and devastatingly effective electoral strategy. they have made a very public break with the symbols of the old rights past, distancing themselves from skinheads, neo-nazis and homophobes. they have also deftly co-opted the causes, policies and rhetoric of their opponents. they have sought to outflank the left when it comes to defending a strong welfare state and protecting social benefits that they claim are threatened by an influx of freeloading migrants. 
they have effectively claimed the progressive causes of the leftfrom gay rights to womens equality and protecting jews from antisemitismas their own, by depicting muslim immigrants as the primary threat to all three groups. as fear of islam has spread, with their encouragement, they have presented themselves as the only true defenders of western identity and western libertiesthe last bulwark protecting a besieged judeo-christian civilisation from the barbarians at the gates. 
these parties have steadily filled an electoral vacuum left open by social democratic and centre-right parties, who ignored voters growing anger over immigrationsome of it legitimate, some of it bigotedor simply waited too long to address it. 
they have shed some of the rights most unsavoury baggage while responding to both economic anxiety and fear of terrorism by blending a nativist economic policymore welfare, but only for us and tough anti-immigration and border security measures. their message is beginning to resonate widely with a fearful population that believes the liberal governing elite no longer listens to them. 
brexit was just the start. europes new far right is poised to transform the continents political landscapeeither by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. and when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far-right party 10 years agothe young, gay people, jews, feministsmay join the working-class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right. 
on 6 may 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of paris to celebrate chiracs historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the dutch far right, pim fortuyn, was gunned down by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. his assassin later claimed that he had killed fortuyn to stop him from using muslims as scapegoats. in national elections nine days later, fortuyns eponymous partythe pim fortuyn list became the second largest in the netherlands with 17 of the vote. 
fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. his time in the limelight was short but transformative. 
it was fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far-right leaders across europe. he may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of plain-spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of islamic culture as a backwards and reactionary threat to the hard-won progressive values of western europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. his ideological inheritors in dutch politics, as well as the revamped front national in france, the danish peoples party and germanys alternative für deutschland have all emulated fortuyn in their own ways. 
fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the european far right was not a us-style appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was defending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration, argues merijn oudenampsen of tilburg university. the netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike france, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to womens liberation and gay rights. 
before founding his own party in 2002, fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre-right party, the peoples party for freedom and democracy vvd, in the late 1990s. the partys then-leader, frits bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. he had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour, said bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of amsterdam. i didnt want him to be in my parliamentary group, so i cold-shouldered him . . . he would have acted as a fragmentation bomb. 
fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of far-right politics in progressive garba form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance, as a new yorker profile once described ithe redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death. 
two years after fortuyn was killed, the netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. early one morning in november 2004, the filmmaker theo van gogh was murdered by a young dutch-moroccan, mohammed bouyeri, who shot van gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. the letter was a death threat aimed at the somali-born dutch parliamentarian ayaan hirsi ali a vocal critic of islam who was soon placed under the protection of the dutch security services. 
the two assassinations shook the netherlands to its core and catapulted a little-known and theatrically coiffed politician, geert wilders , to popularity as an ideological successor to fortuyn. wilders had also flirted with bolkesteins vvd, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. in late 2004, he split off and formed his own. with hirsi ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent anti-immigration voice in the countryand has remained so ever since. 
for those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. six months before chiracs trouncing of le pen and fortuyns assassination, denmark had an election. on its surface the result was not a historical watershed; the centre-right venstre party ousted the social democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. what had changed was that the danish peoples party, which had campaigned on an overtly anti-immigrant platform, took 12 of the votetransforming it into a kingmaker in parliament. 
unlike france, which revelled in its triumph over the fn, or the netherlands, where the remains of fortuyns party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the dpp immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. and it was not only taking votes from the right; it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them. 
the dpp had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the social democratspromising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. as the outgoing social democratic prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat they took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say. back then, naser khader, a danish member of parliament who immigrated from syria as a child, argued that the best way to weaken the dpp is to give them influence. he was wrong. 
the headquarters of the front national sits on a quiet street in the unassuming paris suburb of nanterre, near a car repair shop and a portuguese restaurant. only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. in her modest second-floor office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, marine le pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the holocaust a  detail of history  into a genuine contender for the presidency. 
voluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries, le pen said of her father. but she insisted that she has now cleaned house. i fired them all . . . all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that i found unacceptable. 
julien rochedy, a 28-year-old who headed the fns youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. whereas the partys former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made jews hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, you will be attacked straight away, rochedy said. there is such self-discipline these days. they are so afraid theyll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist. 
still, the partys detractors continue to level the same charges at the fn, which outrages marine le pen . today our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop old tropes about fascists and racists. at a certain point this argument loses its force, she continued, because voters see clearly that theres absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism. 
le pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. she has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and leftand other constituencieswho could never have imagined voting for her fathers front national. 
as le mondes olivier faye has written , she is trying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the fnthat of homophobia. and it is working a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32up from just 19 in a similar poll from 2012. 
as le pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to jewish voters more explicit for a lot of french jews, the fn appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the banlieues , le pen told me. in a very natural way they have turned toward the fn, because the fn is capable, i think, of protecting them from that. 
among french voters threatened by the countrys new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. and peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far-right parties across europe . in france, marine le pen has promised a return to a time when the french had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when french schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation. 
a growing number of french people feel uncomfortable in their own country, the prominent philosopher, alain finkielkraut , declared in january during a debate with the centre-right presidential candidate alain juppéwho has taken a less strident line on islam and migration than his rival nicolas sarkozy. finkielkraut depicted contemporary france as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that the public good isnt in the clouds, its made from tangible thingsthe french of proust and montaigne . . . the jardin du luxembourg and the cows of normandy. 
finkielkraut, a 67-year-old jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the front national, but marine le pens deliberate appeals to jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade agothat the left, with its indulgence of islam, poses a greater threat to france than the far right. after chirac saved the republic from jean-marie le pen in 2002, finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger the future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for vichy, he wrote,  . . . in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nationin the camp of respect, not that of rejection. 
fourteen years later, after the terrorist attacks on charlie hebdo, the bataclan and nice, finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. anti-racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us, he told me when we met in his paris apartment this summer. while he is still no fan of the fn, he believes it has changed and argues that it should be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of anti-fascism. the french must, he insisted, avoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. we must not mistake what era we live in. europe doesnt only have demons; it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies. 
he worries that integration has been such a failure that france will have to reconquer its lost territoriesby which he means the suburbs surrounding paris. integrating people is not telling them you are how you are and we are how we are . . . integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation. and if that doesnt happen, he warned darkly, at best well have secession and at worst civil war. continued immigration from muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the planned demise of europe. 
across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter france has become a potent political force. in the southern city of béziers, mayor robert ménard, a former trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group reporters without borders , is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the french officers who joined a failed coup against de gaulle in 1961 to prevent algerian independence . ménard comes from a family of pieds-noirs , french settlers in algeria. he regards the evian accords that ended the algerian war as a capitulation, and those who tried to preserve french algeria as heroes. 
this nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal, but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect. whereas young britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the eu and the elderly voted to leave, in france it is the opposite. according to julian rochedy, the former fn youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in francewho dream of an era they never witnessedthan with the old, who lived through the era marine le pen promises to restore. it is older voters, rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to le pens victory. they are afraid of leaving the euro, he says. they are afraid of huge changes. rochedy is convinced that the fn will never win simply by fetishising the past. they just want to go back 30 years, he said of his erstwhile colleagues. its a discourse that doesnt at all take into account the world as it is and what france has become. 
even if le pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the rightthe former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western europe. 
as the french communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. according to andrew hussey, a liverpool-born academic who teaches in paris, the technocratic leaders of the socialist party many of them graduates of the ultra-elite ecole nationale dadministrationare so disconnected from ordinary people that even former marxists wont consider voting for them. distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the fn. i think youve got a big political question here about who looks after you, hussey said. this is a very communist way of thinking. 
le pen knows that she is attracting these people. many of her supporters used to be socialists, but they arent any more, she told me. although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare statethats a socialist concept, she insistedle pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich. 
i defend fraternitythe idea that a developed country should be able to be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. the french state no longer does that, she told me. were in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks. and she has seen results. she points to the northern pas-de-calais region. it was socialist-communist for 80 years, she says. i won 45. 
at the same time as marine le pen was working to de-demonise the fn, the leaders of the dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out-of-touch political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear extremist islam. 
geert wilders and his party for freedom pvv have surpassed the dutch labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the march 2017 election. last september, wilders declared that europe was facing an  islamic invasion the sort of comments that landed him in court this week on charges of inciting racial hatred , which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression. 
the presence of masses of young men in their 20s with beards singing allahu akbar across europe, wilders warned at the peak of last years refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to our prosperity, our security, our culture and identity. across the country, grassroots groups responded to wilderss warning, attempting to block the resettlement of asylum seekers in their towns. last october, klaas dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny north-eastern village of oranje, where the dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked dijkhoffs car and tore off its rearview mirrors. a few days later, near utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks. 
in the decade following the assassinations of fortuyn and van gogh, the integration of muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in dutch politics. suddenly, turkish and moroccan-born dutch citizens became muslims. and as the public debate over islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observancewearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during ramadanbecame politically loaded. 
the dutch labour mp ahmed marcouch, who came to the netherlands from rural morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. it is a jolt to the traditionally liberal netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they cant shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. as marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that dutch youth culture promotes. 
wilderss pvv has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugeesone of his latest memes is simply de-islamiseto win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away. 
by framing its anti-migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the pvv has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to euroscepticism. meanwhile, many causes of the radical leftincluding anti-racism and anti-colonialismhave now become establishment thinking in the netherlands. idealism has been bureaucratised, argues the journalist bas heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper nrc handelsblad. and when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it. thats why there is such a strong anti-pc tone to the dutch right do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to. 
just as marine le pens fn has become a huge presence on social media in france, the right is in the midst of colonising the dutch media. geen stijl no style, a popular breitbart-style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. it is massively important, says tilburg universitys merijn oudenampsen, like a social movement. the site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after fortuyns murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in dutch public debate, with an army of reactors on twitter. according to oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that geen stijl is the first site they check in the morning. 
the rights newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist kustaw bessems, from the leftwing volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. in the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left badmouth immigrants and you were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up. now, its the other way around. as soon as you say anything other than immigration is a problem or islam is the cause of terrorism . . . the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you. 
a dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of muslim immigrants and the threat of radical islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of islamism or terrorism. while politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, the economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culturebut none of them have any idea about theology. even scholars of radicalisation tend to study todays extremists through the historical lens of the european radical leftwhich does little to explain what leads a small number of young muslim men such as van goghs killer, mohamed bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. its easy to be a marxist, the security official quipped. its fucking hard to be a salafi. 
as the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far rights tirades about islamisation. these days it is not only anti-migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. there are also many disappointed progressivesthe people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of dutch society. suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. there is a sense that, we are welcoming and then they do this, says bas heijne. they have been terribly let down in their good intentions. and in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and jews feel threatenedand some have become reflexively suspicious of muslims. 
the stereotype that observant muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. when the moroccan-born labour mp ahmed marcouch first joined in amsterdams legendary gay pride parade , he was, as he puts it, the first hetero-active muslim to participate. the gay community feared violence from extremists; conservative muslims were baffled and angry. both groups concluded, oh, maybe marcouch is homosexual too, he says with a laugh. neither group could imagine a straight muslim doing what he did. 
but public displays of solidarity such as marcouchs are rare. among openly gay couples and religious jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young muslim men. much as in france, this fraught atmosphere has made far-right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them. 
in amsterdam earlier this year, i had several meetings with a staunch jewish supporter of wilderss pvv, who insisted on remaining anonymous. he described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed alain finkielkraut. its an outdated reflex for jews to always say the problem is the extreme right, he told me. we have new enemies and we need new ideas. 
the experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that europes capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. anne frank wasnt betrayed by the germans, he argued. but by dutch people. regular dutch. jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. the trains for the jews will always come, he added, ominously. id rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains. 
he is not unsympathetic to the plight of european muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. if i were a muslim in europe at this moment id be very uneasy, he admitted. if europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. its the history of europe to treat foreigners terribly. we jews know that. 
for that reason, he argues, muslims should regard wilders as a lesser evil. every muslim should be happy geert wilders exists. if someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse, he told me menacingly. wilders is civil. he is a democrat. he is not the new hitler. 
to frits bolkestein, who led the netherlands centre-right vvd in the 1990sand was briefly wilders boss when he was a young aide in the party officethe rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about islam. the dutch labour party, he argues, gave up on its working-class base they made a major mistake, he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. faced with the choice between the foreign-born and the labour classes, they chose the foreign-born  and theyve paid for it dearly. current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds out of 150 to just 10. 
marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in france, many former labour voters now back wilders. moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white dutch families were moving out. their message to the labour party, he said, is you ignored us. you let it happen. 
the danish peoples party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged anti-immigrant sentiment to siphon away the social democrats traditional basepeople who fear that the bread will be buttered more thinly, as the danish journalist lars trier mogensen puts it. 
the dpp has effectively combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro-welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. søren espersen, the dpps deputy leader, doesnt think that former social democrats will ever go back. when one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking, he says of voters who supported the social democrats all their lives. and why should he go back? i mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then hes done it. 
the social democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the dpp. one of those places is the small satellite town of herlev, about 10 miles west of copenhagen. the 41-year-old social democratic mayor, thomas gyldal petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his partys political misfortunes. 
for gyldal petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. as soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrantor majority unemployedhe says, problems start to arise. he blames his own partys leaders mayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change. but the party leadership shut their eyes, he says. 
then came the muhammad cartoons . in 2005, the editors at jyllands-posten, denmarks largest newspaper, invited a group of well-known cartoonists to draw the prophet. the initial response was underwhelming, but within a few monthsthrough a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imamsthe cartoons became a full-blown crisis, with boycotts of danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the middle east. danes who had never contemplated voting for the dpp now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their best-known journalists. suddenly, the dpps platform was making sense. they had warned that muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. politicians such as naser khader, who once warned that giving the dpp influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum. when khader founded a new organisation called democratic muslims in the wake of the cartoon controversy, he received death threats. 
those at the top of the social democrats are now taking a tough stance, too. earlier this year the party leader, mette frederiksen, went to stockholm to meet with fellow scandinavian social democrats. there she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. we social democrats must accept that there is a clash, she declared. it is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help . . . but just as strong is our value that we must have a well-functioning welfare state. frederiksen continued my position is that a universally funded scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy. 
but in its zeal to get tough on migration, denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivismthe sort of place that bernie sanders liked to mention at campaign rallies. in january, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, denmark passed what became known as the  jewellery law , which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10,000 kroner 1,200 would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating asylum-seekers. editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. according to kenneth kristensen berth, a babyfaced mp for the dpp, it was about deterrence. the goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in denmark, he said. the jewellery provision was a minor part. more important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years, he added. and it wasnt just the dpp and government who supported itthe social democrats voted for it, too. 
bent melchior, denmarks 87-year-old former chief rabbi, was outraged. he bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. he would know although denmark is always hailed for saving its jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that danish jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to sweden. melchiors family paid the equivalent of almost a years rent of a six-room flat just for his own passage. denmark is not a poor country, for gods sake, melchior says. theres food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody. 
the road that led a centre-left party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. the scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. as the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. there has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. but the larger issue, as the oxford economist paul collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor. 
herlevs mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. we have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to denmark in a number that we can help. if the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together, petersen warns. 
but such balance may only help so much. aydin soei, a danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the danish governmentone that native danes who have never been on the receiving end of the states integration policy have failed to see. a lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of the state recognising their education and their skills, soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. if your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago, he argues. 
instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored themassuming that its work was done. the problem, soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. it doesnt have consequences for the politicians . . . because they dont have the right to vote. either way, it plays into the dpps argument. immigrants cant do right, said gyldal petersen. when theyre unemployed theyre a burden to society. when theyre in a job, they just stole the job from a dane. 
whether or not marine le pen wins next years french election or wilders pvv becomes the largest party in the netherlands, the new far right is not going away. the reflex among many establishment partiesand media institutionshas been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back. 
rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. when i spoke again recently with the jewish wilders supporter from amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been wonregardless of the outcome of next years elections. the pvv has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. the labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing wilders said five years ago, he told me. you can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate. 
if traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the meritsand flawsof their policies and counter their messages of fear. 
not least among the lessons of brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just one more thing nobody asked them about . this is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. and the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. they know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as jean-marie le pen was, as antisemites or racists. 
in france, the new majority marine le pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the brexit campaign victory. in a park near calais castle-like town hall in may, samuel and pascal, activists from a group named retake calais, railed against the towns centre-right mayor. they blamed her for the growth of the sprawling, trash-strewn tent city known as the jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until it was dismantled this month . those who govern us are completely against us. the illegals, who arent french, can do whatever they want, they told me. for them, even marine le pen is too soft. 
if resettlement programmes take refugees away from calais to other parts of france, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. theyre sending them to all the little villages in france, says samuel. after they start to open businesses and bring family members, in two years the village will be dead. 
about a mile down the road, the calais ferry terminal lies behind layers of tall steel fences and coiled barbed wire. i met rudy vercucque and yohann faviere, the local fn leaders, on a blustery morning in june outside the terminal, where they were anxiously awaiting a visiting eu dignitary. giant seagulls circled and squawked above as they denounced the mayor, natacha bouchart, a member of sarkozys republicans party. 
its she who has permitted this, vercucque, a portly 35-year-old, fumed. and it was sarkozy, he reminded me, who negotiated the notorious le touquet accords , effectively moving the british border to where we were standing. calais depends on british tourism and revenues are down sharply. the result is crippling economic and social malaise find a doctor who wants to move to calais. find a surgeon who wants to move to calais, vercucque exclaimed. you work your whole life, you pay off your house and you lose money. its intolerable. their support locally may have once been a protest vote, said faviere, but no longer. today we really have people who adhere to our ideas. 
vercucque was more blunt we say out loud what people think deep down.",13,736271,fake

trump is finishing the race the way many republicans wished he could have run it from the start fiercely on message and on offense  realclearpolitics . trump has largely adhered to his teleprompters and resisted controversial tweets this week. as clinton campaigned a few days ago with alicia machado, the former miss universe winner with whom trump has infamously feuded, the gop nominee focused primarily on higher costs for obamacare and the revived fbi investigation into emails pertinent to clintons private server. the campaign believes those issues bolster his closing argument that clinton is corrupt and a vestige of old politics, while he says hes an agent of change. 
our polling data suggests that the missing whites arent exactly conservative populists who support mr. trump. theyre just dissatisfied they dont like their candidate, and they dont like the other partys candidate much either  new york times . the registered white missing democrats, for instance, support mrs. clinton by only 61 percent to 19 percent. the missing registered white republicans support mr. trump by only 69 to 13. 
election update why clintons position is worse than obamas nate silver, fivethirtyeight . in the table below, ive run a head-to-head comparison showing how many electoral votes each candidate was projected to have at various margins of victory or defeat. for instance, obama had a lead in states and congressional districts totaling 332 electoral votes in our final 2012 forecast. clinton leads in states totaling only 272 electoral votes, just two more than the minimum she needs to win the electoral college. in brief, clinton is stronger than obama among highly educated voters in states that she would win anyhow , and weaker among white voters without college degrees in states that are close.

the u.s. government believes hackers from russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next weeks presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling, american officials told nbc news. the effort is being coordinated by the white house and the department of homeland security, but reaches across the government to include the cia, the national security agency and other elements of the defense department, current and former officials say  nbc .  officials are alert for any attempts to create election day chaos, and say steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet. but what is more likely, multiple u.s. officials say, is a lower-level effort by hackers from russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating twitter, facebook and other social media platforms. for example, officials fear an 11th hour release of fake documents implicating one of the candidates in an explosive scandal without time for the news media to fact check it.

with hillary clinton and donald trump breathtakingly close in polls of key states, analysts are beginning to factor in the possibility of recounts that would delay the outcome  marketwatch . bear in mind that a candidate would have limited time to contest the vote. this year, the electoral college is due to meet on dec. 19. by law, electors meet on the first monday after the second wednesday in december. a recount would make florida 2000 look like a walk in the park, especially because clinton, bless her heart, is unlikely to let herself be rolled, unlike gore. 
michigan hillary clinton is hanging onto a narrow 4-point lead over donald trump in michigan heading into the last weekend before tuesdays election, with a new free press poll showing clear momentum for the republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the democrat  detroit free press .  the number of undecided voters  13  remains extraordinarily high for this late in an election cycle, speaking to the high unfavorable marks voters give both major party candidates. normally, id say a 4 lead is a lot, but those undecideds. wowsers.

"no pain no gain? lockheed struggles to finalize deal with pentagon on f-35 lots get short url 0 8 0 0 us defense contractor lockheed martin has not yet settled with the f-35 joint program office on three main contractual points regarding two low-rate initial production lrip lots for the f-35 jet, and has been lagging on the schedule for roughly a year. 
the deal on the f-35 programs lrip 9 and 10, originally intended to be inked in november 2015, is still in negotiations, defense news reported. the more you spend the more you save?! us lawmakers fight to increase f-35 budget lockheeds chief financial officer, bruce tanner, explained during a tuesday earnings conference call that the sides are yet to agree on the cost of fulfilling the contract obligations, terms, and conditions regarding jet construction, and the amount of money to be paid to the manufacturer.
i'd say we haven't really reached closure on any of those three points, tanner was quoted by defense news as saying. 
lockheed ceo marillyn hewson stated that the delay is normal, as the contract is very large and that there is a lot of work that has to happen. 
during the negotiation process, lockheed spent some 900 million of its own capital to keep the beleaguered project afloat. however, the defense department reimbursed the aircraft manufacturers expenses in a 1 billion transaction in august. earlier this month, an additional 743 million was allocated for lrip 9. 
still, lockheed says it lacks funding to maintain the pace of production process for both lrips. despite not yet receiving funding sufficient to cover its costs, the corporation continued work in an effort to meet the customers desired aircraft delivery dates, the lockheed's news release stated. currently, the corporation has approximately 950 million of potential cash exposure and 2.3 billion in termination liability exposure related to the f-35 lrip 9 and 10 contracts.  flickr times asi cant fix the f-35? us navy, air force look towards 6th generation fighter instead meanwhile, northrop grumman, a principal member of the f-35 production team, stated on tuesday that they had settled with lockheed on the pricing of lrip 9 and 10, flight global reported.
we have completed our negotiations on lots 9 and 10 with lockheed, which is typical for a prime contractor to want to lock down its supply chain as it finishes off negotiations with a customer, northrop chief executive wes bush said tuesday. 
the lrip 9 and 10 effort, costing some 14 billion, suggests the production of about 150 of the jets. the troubled contract is now expected to be finalized december 2016, according to f-35 joint program executive officer lt. gen. christopher bogdan. ...",168,736264,fake

"crossing the acheron back to vietnam email 
in classical mythology, the acheron is one of the rivers of the underworld. it marks the boundary between the living and the dead. the ferryman charon ferries the dead across the acheron to a place where they lose memory. nothing of what made them human remainshappiness, suffering, love, hatred, guilt, regret, redemption, betrayal, forgiveness. 
from gilgamesh to odysseus to aeneas, the living heroes of the epic descend into the underworld at a point of despair in the sense of their quest. burdened by a fate that requires momentous courage and tragic self-sacrifice for the sake of their peoples survival, they resent the absurdity of their lot. down there on a visit, they return from the shadow land strengthened. they recognize that the business of living is not oblivion but action. 
john marcianos recently published book, the american war in vietnam crime or commemoration ? functions as such a charon in reverse. it ferries readers back to the realm of remembering. this slim volume could not have come at a more opportune moment. american political culture is punch-drunk with the pursuit of war. the altered state is reaching the point of delirium tremens. thwarted in the neocolonial scheme of annexing syria by russias legal intervention, the american elite are pushing for confrontation. though it is hard to think the unthinkable, the nuclear holocaust may happen if not by intention then by spontaneous combustion from over-intoxication with the fumes of war. 
this reckless confrontation results from decades of accumulated unaccountable power. its boldness reflects a cumulative experience of impunity for aggressive behavior by soft and hard neocolonial postures since the end of ww ii. the war in vietnam, as marciano suggests, should have functioned as the lesson that checked the nations historical thrust for conquest, but the turning point would have required a national effort to relinquish the myth of the noble cause, the delusion that america is vested with a divine mandate to assimilate the people of the world to the american imagefor the peoples own good. britain had its white mans burden; france its mission civilatrise ; america its manifest destiny. 
this timely volume traces the war to the apocalyptic finale of the most powerful military in the world defeated by the determination, courage, and self-sacrifice of a peasant people unwilling to be enslaved. but this is as much a book about the past as it is about the present. it reminds us, with tolstoy, the reality of war is in the killing,  a realization officialdom would like to block. in fact, they have prepared a falsifying celebration of that moral and military debacle. 
as marciano writes in his introduction, 
in may 2012, president barack obama and the pentagon announced a commemoration of the vietnam war to continue through 2025, the fiftieth anniversary of the conflicts end. among the commemorations objectives, three stand out to thank and honor veterans and their families . . . to highlight the advances in technology, science, and medicine related to military research conducted during the war; and to recognize the contributions and sacrifices made by the allies. 
president obama claimed in the commemoration announcement speech that the war had been an honorable cause. marciano challenges this notion. americas historic ideology of the noble cause, he writes, rests on the belief that the united states is 
a unique force for good in the world, superior not only in its military and economic power, but in the quality of its government and institutions, the character and morality of its people, and its way of life. 
this is the mystical bigotry of a messianic faith typical of empires. imperial militarism seeks in a noble cause the justification for subjugating large chunks of humanity. in the distant past, the noble cause may have received the sword directly from a godas it did in postcolonial america when it sought to exterminate the native inhabitants. by the anointment of the sword, the divinity also endowed, supposedly, the conquering race with moral superiority. thus, imperialism, in the perverse arrogance of its twisted psyche, contains the germ of genocide. as a result, the superstition of a superior race has been endured by most of the races on the planet as a most ignoble cause. in vietnam alone, the big lie of the noble cause sent four million vietnamese to their death. 
marciano leaves us in no doubt that the white house and the pentagon are commemorating a crime. they are falsifying history in order to shape the future, which will be and is the reenactment of the war against vietnam on a global scale. they want to establish the altar for a sacred union, the nation united behind the noble cause of war. on the altar will sit the fetish of the export of the miracle of democracy,  in reality the imposition of regimes of terror such as the vietnam war planners established in saigon. we see today in ukraine that the miracle of democracy, brought to kiev by the us in 2014 to the tune of five billion dollars, amounts to a handful of dry dust, collected from the ww ii graveyard of european nazism, inciting a lot of blind, anti-democratic and noxious nationalism. 
as through a glass darkly, marciano shows us that in the war crime against vietnam we can see reflected the crimes perpetrated today from afghanistan to yemen, from iraq to syria, from yugoslavia to libya and across the african continent. as in vietnam the fakery of the gulf of tonkin incident, todays war are based on fabricated pretexts; as in vietnam napalm and agent orange, todays wars are chemical wars depleted uranium for yugoslavia and iraq; phosphorus for falluja; as in vietnam hanoi and haiphong the bombings destroy urban life, vital infrastructure, schools and hospitals; as in vietnam laos, cambodia the bombings spreads out today to yemen; as in vietnam ho chi minh the leaders who resist us penetration are demonized milosevic, saddam, qaddafi, assad as enemies of humanity. as in vietnam, all the wars of today are fought mostly to prevent or reverse independence and self-determination of former colonial places. 
finally, as in vietnam the ussr, todays russia is emerging as the displacement of all the guilt that weighs on the shoulders of the noble cause. the washington post recently wrote the kremlin annexed ukraine. i read it twicenot annexed crimea, the standard disinformation, but the whole of ukraine! does one laugh or weep? does one have to take a hallucinogenic to see russian flags and images of putin blanketing kiev instead of neo-nazi emblems and images of bandera? 
the next president will certainly be hillary clinton, whom i call the centripetal president. from republicans to democrats to neo-cons, all converge on endorsing the war candidate. in her consensus war regime, the elite will decide everything. we will not be consulted. this is why the american war in vietnam crime or commemoration? is a vital read. it calls for our re-democratizationto question our leaders, to be skeptical of the media, to avert our eyes from the petrifying stare of the medusa decked with the aegis of the noble cause; to challengeeven ridicule the vaunted humanitarianism of an elite of bloodhounds baying for war; to refuse to commemorate war crimes and to work to stop them. 
above all, we need to remember that the crimes of other governments are the responsibility of the people of those governmentsnot of our bombs. though our elite have abrogated to themselves the power and the right to remake the map of the world by force, we need to reassert the legal principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign states if we are serious about peace. we, citizens, do not have the right or the power, unless we line up behind the power of the militarist state to change the practices of other states, but we do have the right to demand change for those of our own. lets start exercising that right. we did for vietnam; we can do it again. commemorate the people who protested the war in vietnam, not the crime the governing elite committed there in our name, as marcianos book amply documents.

"george w. bushs ethics lawyer files complaint against fbi director james comey richard w. painter wrote in a new york times an op-ed the f.b.i.s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. 
such acts could also be prohibited under the hatch act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. that is why the f.b.i. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. the usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. 
and that is why, on saturday, i filed a complaint against the f.b.i. with the office of special counsel, which investigates hatch act violations, and with the office of government ethics. i have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers ethics, including two and a half years as the chief white house ethics lawyer for president george w. bush, and i never thought that the f.b.i. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. until this week. 
this is the second complaint to be filed against fbi director comey. the democratic coalition against trump has also filed a complaint against comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee. 
suspicion around comeys actions has grown as the fbi director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election. director comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as senate democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the fbi investigation if they win back the senate majority. 
unless trump wins and republicans take control of congress, director comey is going to have to answer for his decisions.

die tatverdächtigen  größtenteils junge migranten aus nordafrika  hätten sich wohl im bereich um den hauptbahnhof zum gemeinsamen feiern verabredet, anders sei nicht zu erklären, warum sich über 1000 dieser jungen männer gleichzeitig auf dem platz befunden hätten, so der kriminologe prof. dr. rudolf egg, der aussagen von über 1000 opfern analysiert hat.  reuters benoit tessier nach sexuellen übergriffen wels darf nicht köln werden

erklärungsversuche seitens des polizeigewerkschafters die kollegen, die dort im einsatz waren, haben eine äußerst schwierige situation vorgefunden. es waren von anfang an viel zu wenige kräfte da. ich kann mir vorstellen, dass kollegen mit anderen aufgaben beschäftigt waren und gesagt haben ich kann jetzt nicht, gehen sie zur nächsten wache. wenn aber eine frau, wie es geschildert wurde, von mehreren personen angegangen wurde, zu zwei beamten gegangen wäre und die sich nicht gekümmert hätten, weggeguckt hätten, dann wäre das nicht akzeptabel. man kann die person nicht mit dem gefühl stehen lassen hier kümmert sich keiner, es ist uninteressant, was ich erlitten habe. 
statt eines aktiven eingreifens seitens der polizei sollen die opfer mehrfach den ratschlag bekommen haben, sich von den stellen fernzuhalten, wo sie belästigt worden seien. 
manchmal ist der ratschlag, bestimmte plätze zu meiden, so falsch nicht. aber das kann nicht die lösung des problems sein. man kann potentiellen opfern nicht die verantwortung dafür übertragen, dass nichts passiert. die politik und die sicherheitsorgane müssen sich auf andere weise darauf vorbereiten, denn die schuld liegt nicht bei den opfern, sondern bei den tätern., kommentiert egg. 
mindestens fraglich ist auch, warum die polizei angesichts der aus der kontrolle geratenen situation keine verstärkung angefordert hatte. polizeigewerkschafter plickert bestätigt, dass es für die silvesternacht sofortverstärkungskräfte gegeben hätte, aber die hätten erst aus anderen behörden angefordert werden müssen und wären zu spät gekommen, um an der lage in köln etwas ausrichten zu können.  reuters wolfgang rattay kölner silvesternacht schrecken vieler frauen wird zu schreck für frau merkel um 2230 hat es eine besprechung mit dem polizeiführer und dem führer der bundespolizei gegeben und man hat gemerkt, es läuft aus dem ruder, und sich dazu entschlossen, den platz zu räumen. zu dem zeitpunkt hätte es keinen sinn mehr gemacht, eine hundertschaft anzufordern, denn sie wäre erst gegen 1 uhr da gewesen. um 2325 hat man mit der räumung begonnen und diese ist auch relativ unproblematisch verlaufen. 
nun gelte es, unter anderem in dem untersuchungsausschuss im düsseldorfer landtag, der bereits 49 sitzungen hinter sich hat, bei denen zeugen und gutachter gehört werden, das geschehene zu analysieren und die richtigen schlüsse daraus zu ziehen. 
wir werden uns zukünftig einsatzmäßig anders aufstellen. es wird ein gemeinsames sicherheitskonzept mit der stadt geben. an solchen plätzen gibt es eine videoüberwachung und ich gehe davon aus, dass in solchen tagen auch die räume besser ausgeleuchtet werden. letztes silvester waren wir mit 130 landespolizisten in köln eingesetzt, dieses jahr gehe ich davon aus, dass wir mit 1000 polizisten präsent sein werden. ich glaube, alle bundesländer werden sich in der kommenden silvesternacht kräftemäßig besser aufstellen, weil alle diese szenarien von köln vor augen haben, sagt polizeigewerkschafter arnold plickert.

"standing rock and imperialism itself standing rock and imperialism itself by gary leupp
november 09, 2016 "" information clearing house "" - "" counterpunch "" - the dakota access pipeline was originally scheduled to cross the state of north dakota north of bismarck, the state capital pop. 70,000. but then the route was shifted 40 miles south, to the south, to pass by the standing rock sioux reservation pop. 8200. this is sovereign territory of the sioux, whose reservation straddles north and south dakota and whose members include hunkpapa lakota and yaktonai dakota.
the sioux are a nation of about 170,000 people, divided linguistically into the lakotas, dakotas and nakotas concentrated in what are now north and south dakota. we know that there were some in what is now either wisconsin or minnesota in 1660 because french traders met them and recorded the encounter. they may have advanced into the dakotas only after that.
i mention these details only to suggest that the sioux have not always been in their current zone. native american tribeslike germanic, celtic, slavic, turkish or bantu tribes elsewheremigrated and settled over time, and sometimes reached a new territory simultaneous with the first europeans arrival.
for example the apache may have migrated into what is now the u.s. southwest some 500 years ago, just as the spanish conquistadors were arriving. since they spoke an athabaskan language, it seems likely that they descended from people who had lived in alaska 500 years earlier. they had wandered a long way from home.
the inuit, who originated in siberia over 10,000 years ago, entered alaskas north slope around 3000 bce and started spreading out throughout the islands of the canadian arctic peninsula around 1000 ce reaching greenland in a short time. they arrived on that large island around the same time that the scandinavians did. both had come a long way. we should always question the my people have always been here allegation. the nativesettler dichotomy is simplistic. we all come from somewhere else.
the standing rock reservations boundaries are defined by the fort laramie treaty or horse creek treaty of 1851, which exchanged sioux recognition of the right of the united states government to establish roads, military and other posts, within their respective territories on their territory for a u.s. commitment to protect the aforesaid indian nations against the commission of all depredations by the people of the said united states, after the ratification of this treaty. they are confirmed by another treaty signed in 1868.
back to the dakota access pipeline. according to the bismarck tribune , the route was changed due to concern that the dapl, built by sunoco and projected to send 500,000 gallons of oil every day from north dakota to illinois, would endanger the water supply to the citys residents.
these by the way are 92 white, 4 native american, 4 other. full disclosure my father was born and grew up and was raised in north dakota, as was his father before him. i visited bismarck multiple times in my childhood. one of my mothers brothers worked in government there. it is a very white place.
the water issue is the first issue of two raised by those protesting the dapl raise. the missouri river that constitutes the reservation border is the peoples only source of water. specifically, lake oahe, which is a large swelling within the river straddling the two dakotas. it is at present quite pure. the pipeline will flow beneath it. the army corps of engineers has assessed that it will pose no threat to the water, but the people point to reports that pipelines leak. the standing rock sioux are arguing in court that the pipeline directly violates the tribes rights as a sovereign nation because it will hurt its drinking water resources.
quick google search ap reports that from 1995 to the present, there have been over 2,000 significant accidents involving oil and petroleum pipelines in this country, producing billions of dollars in damage. incidents rose from 2006 to 2015 by 60. from 2013 to 2015, an average of 121 accidents happened every year. the yellowstone river pipeline leak spilled 50,000 gallons of oil into the glendale, montana water supply in march 2015. 6000 residents were for a time instructed not to drink the water, like flint residents were in 2014, although that involved a different poisoning issue.
just check out wikipedias list of pipeline accidents in the u.s. in the 21st century .
it includes this entry in january 2005, a mid-valley owned and sunoco operated pipeline ruptured, spilling 260,000 us gallons 980,000 l of oil into the kentucky and ohio rivers. the u.s. environmental protection agency fined the companies 2.5 million for the spill.
in other words, the standing rock sioux have good reason for concern about the quality of their environment and health at sunocos hands, and for outrage at the manner in which the army corps of engineers conducted its environmental impact assessment. and the very fact that the route was shifted south from bismarck to indian country precisely due to fears about water contaminationwhat is this but unbridled racism?
the second issue is that of sacred burial sites. this might seem less important, especially to the irreligious outsider. but the ongoing protest observances conducted by representatives of many tribes in north dakota involve many religious practices related to identity sacred songs and dancing, prayers, peace pipes, sweat lodge meetings, water protection rituals. they believe strongly in the appropriate handling of the burial grounds.
this does not mean demanding respect for the boundaries of a discrete cemetery site but rather the recognition that a broad swathe of sovereign land long used for burial purposes is off-limits from to quote the treaty again depredations by the people of the united states such as typically accompany these projects. it seems reasonable to demand that recognition for burial sites, especially some of the most infuriating and provocative actions of the u.s. in relation to native peoples have involved the treatment of the latters remains.
the national park service recently built a  3 million boardwalk over native sacred burial sites and spent tax dollars damaging 78 such sites. it built over 200 sacred mounds without doing any impact analysis and, according to a congressional report know what they were doing was wrong. and theres a long history of the theft and exploitation of native americans remains. doesnt yale universitys skull and bones society still boast that it acquired geronimos skull in the 1910s?
the cheyenne river sioux tribe has accused pipeline goons of knowingly destroying sacred sites. so this, too, is reason to oppose dapl. but the main reason for opposition is not water purity, nor even respect for ones ancestors, but the sioux tribes aspirations for sovereignty, on land assigned them by violated treaties, as they come up against capitalist imperialism itself.
why are the treaties so violated, still? isnt it all about private property, oil profits, indifference to the environment, inevitable state support to the biggest property-ownersthat is to say, isnt it all about the system itself? which we all, in our different ways, oppose?
it was beautiful to see in cannon ball, north dakota, the largest gatherings in recent times of representatives of native peoples from many tribes, and many allies from many places and movements, in defense of their rights. as it happens, the movement to stop dapl dovetails with the bourgeoning black lives matter movement and the networks formed out of occupy wall street and the disillusioned bernie campaign. young people of all ethnic backgrounds are realizing that capitalism and imperialism suck, and that the shameful history of slavery and racism needs to be recognized and repudiated.
add to this the realization that native americans are rallying against big oil and in so doing benefiting all of us. and then imagine an anti-war, anti-hillary movement that channels the energies of these several movements for economic justice, racial justice and native rights into a revolutionary movement focused on the real problem of imperialism itself, which the new president will likely personify. gary leupp is professor of history at tufts university, and holds a secondary appointment in the department of religion. he is the author of servants, shophands and laborers in in the cities of tokugawa japan ; male colors the construction of homosexuality in tokugawa japan ; and interracial intimacy in japan western men and japanese women, 1543-1900 . he is a contributor to hopeless barack obama and the politics of illusion , ak press. he can be reached at gleupptufts.edu",91,736277,fake
"hero of novorossiya honoring the death of arsen pavlov aka ""motorola"" thu, 27 oct 2016 1301 utc arsen pavlov, or motorola, was the leader of the sparta battalion in the war for donbass. the people of novorossiya aka the donbass have suffered a terrible loss. arsen pavlov better known to the world as motorola was assassinated in a brutal terrorist bombing on october 16, 2016. he was a beloved commander and a hero to the people of the donbass, to russia, and to people all over the world who oppose the fascist junta in ukraine and us imperialism. the murder was no doubt ordered by the empire in revenge for russia's intervention in syria which one year later appears to have decisively shifted the war. on every front the saa are making advances and winning new victories especially in the battle to fully liberate aleppo from nato's terrorist death squads. thankfully after the treacherous bombing at deir ezzor russia was in no mood to give into the empty threats of full scale nuclear war the empire claimed it was prepared to launch in order to halt the liberation of eastern aleppo. slowly the saa are making gains on multiple fronts in eastern ghoutha, in homs, in aleppo. arsen pavlov was born in the komi republic at 15 he became an orphan and moved in with a grandmother. he joined the russian naval infantry where he gained the callsign motorola. he joined as a conscript but volunteered to reenlist and served in the 2nd chechen war where he gained valuable experience, and they say became addicted to war. he was a bit of an adrenaline junky which added to his charisma since he was paradoxically cheerful in the most dangerous situations. he had a great sense of humor which came through even to non-russian speakers like myself but he was even more beloved in russia and ukraine for his hilarious narrations of the war in ukraine. he was involved in the war in ukraine from the start. he visited maidan where he overheard some ukrainian fascists saying that they would kill ten russians for every ukrainian they lost. he decided to join the anti-maidan movement participating in counter-protests in eastern ukraine in karkov and other cities before heading to crimea to aid the people in fulfilling their long held dream of reuniting with russia. it was in crimea that he met igor strelkov who was impressed with his military experience and cheerful daring. thus motorola was one of the small group of men he brought with him to slavyansk where a handful of veterans worked with the brave locals managing keep the ukrainian military tied down for months allowing vital time for donetsk and lugansk to solidify their defenses . in slavyansk strelkov and motorola would become legends. motorola became well known early on because not only was he a brave fighter he was also a master of information war. it was motorola who filmed many of the early battles of the war and also helped sympathetic journalists cover the war from the front lines. he well understood that the wars of today are fought not just on the battlefields but on the internet, on youtube, on social media. he helped mobilize global support for novorossia's war to remain independent of fascist ukraine inspiring volunteers from around the world. he was also able wage psychological warfare on the ukrainians using his instincts as a prankster. he managed to convince the ukrainians that there were 300 chechen special forces aiding the novorossian's in the area by playing a recording of the muslim call to prayer every day. the paranoid ukrainians fell for it and did not dare to invade the area. motorola would go on to fight in many of the major battles of the war. he was not one of those commanders who lead from behind. instead motorola often fought on the front lines with his men. how could he ask his fighters to risk their lives when he would not do the same he would explain when questioned. thus like the legendary mozgovoi motorola was reported dead many times in the course of the war by the ukrainian media always reappearing to make a mockery of such claims. to do justice to his heroic actions in the war in ukraine would require writing a history of much of the war since he was at so many famous battles nikolayevka semyonuka, ilovaisk, debaltsevo, donetsk. he became the commander of the spartak battalion and was instrumental in liberating donetsk airport from the fascist self styled ""cyborgs."" he had a beautiful and courageous wife and three children. he was officially declared a hero of novorossia and honored in last years victory parade celebrating both the victory over fascism in ""the great patriotic war"" as world war 2 is known in russia but also the victories in the 2014-2015 wars of independence that saw the nato backed fascist ukrainian army and it's death squad allies thoroughly smashed. arsen pavlov with his wife yelena kolenkina read the rest of the article here . comment further reading the commander of the sparta battalion of the donetsk people's republic and famous defender of donbass known by his callsign ""motorola,"" arsen pavlov, was killed today, october 16th, by a bomb in his apartment building's

"loretta lynch takes on 'killer cops' -- except in d.c. print 
have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own? 
for the federal government, its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. 
you will recall, of course, how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. 
now loretta lynch, his successor, also known as hillary clintons guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington. 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians, she reported this month. 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about community-police relations, lynch said. in the days ahead, the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve. 
the irony here is thick, indeed. 
one of lynchs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. 
meanwhile, lynch presides over the most egregious cover-up of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital. 
lynch wants reports? 
so does wnd, which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey. unfortunately, lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the 92-page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation. this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have, based on the evidence. why officers used deadly force. whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave., maryland ave. and 2nd street. only stills have been released. video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger, as doj claimed, when he fired fatal shot to careys head. not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer, as the doj claimed. police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey, two from the capitol police and two from the secret service. not one statement from those officers was in the report. their names were also redacted. redacted information an attorney in the washington, d.c., mayors office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. it turned out much more was redacted than names. the report was riddled with blacked-out sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. some of the blacked-out pages just included a heading marked evidence. some just had a date. witness statements an astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. the police report stated there were seventy-two 72 witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings. copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review. copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad. of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to wnd, leaving 38 missing. statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk. white house guard post video stills were released but not the video. it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up; whether she tried to drive around the off-duty guard who dragged a gate in front of her; and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material. also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters. ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. 
i could go on and on. for people who want facts and reports, the u.s. justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. 
weve been at this for a long time  years. yet the stonewall and cover-up of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that?

"comment on sweden on the brink? police force pushed to breaking point by violence amid migrant influx by paul blake dcg  5 comments 
aint multiculturalism grand? 
from daily express  the scandinavian country is facing an existential crisis with on average three police officers handing in their resignations a day. if the alarming trend continues, and police officers continue to resign more than 1,000 officers will have quit the service by new years. 
since the migrant crisis began last summer, sweden has been hit by a series of brutal crimes and violent incidents . in 2015 alone sweden, with a population of 9.5million, received over 160,000 asylum applications and the country is expected to take as many as 190,000 refugees, or two per cent of the population, by the end of 2016. 
since the second world war sweden has prided itself on helping migrants who cross their borders despite some moves to the political right in recent years. 
but police have now admitted the force has reached breaching point as more than 50 areas in the country have now been placed on a no-go zone list . 
in february a report from swedens national criminal investigation service announced there were 52 areas where officers would not cope with the levels of crime being committed . sex assaults , drug dealing and children carrying weapons were just some of the incidents mentioned in the report. in september, swedish officials were forced to add another three areas to the list. 
now the police association have said they need at least 200 new officers to regain control in the south-east of the country. 
thomas stjernfeldt, from the regions police association, told svt  we are missing extremely many officers in the operational sector, right now we need 200 more officers to be added to the force to establish a reasonable working environment in the southeast of götaland . götaland is one of the regions in the country that has been hit hard by the car fire attacks, which have been occurring throughout sweden. 
on monday, express.co.uk reported a number of the arsonist attacks in the city of växjö, in götaland, had been committed by frustrated migrants . currently there are more than 6,000 suspected crimes that are unsolved in the area and 400 of these cases are suspected to be rapes, murder or attempted murder. 
mr. stjernfeldt said the figures are alarming and police officers are constantly forced to work overtime in an attempt to solve the reported crimes. 
the police association admitted it fears the public will lose faith in the force and their ability to protect citizens if the situation is not resolved. 
the unions call for more resources echoes national police commissioner dan eliassons february warning, where he said he needed a further 4,100 officers and specialist staff to reestablish law and order in sweden.

" i agree, but compare other organisms, in effect all organisms are corporate in nature. it is failure to diversify that leads to endangering any species. to diversify is survival. corporations that rely on a fixed market die out - high button shoes, spats, buggy whips, oil lanterns etc. maybe they need a warning, caution! peace is about to break out! time to do something else!
failure to diversify results in high irony. the peruvian potato fed millions but caused economic ruin and starvation for the irish. in peru, they have 5000 varieties and nobody starves when one goes bad. ireland had only one genetic species, and that's the point. had the lazy spanish stolen a few more varieties from the incas, there'd have been far and away fewer irish firemen to put out the chicago fire. one's opinion of chicago notwithstanding.
while i agree with you, i think the point is the economic model is lazy, it's comfortable profiting with war tools and not paying attention to humanity's real needs or goals. is war popular with anyone not in office or engaged in the business of making war toys? no. that laziness is the real trouble. they're engaging in pressure and lobbyist campaign contribution bribery for their own benefit, certainly not the innocent public everywhere.

"top aide to hillary clinton urges the fbi to disclose what it knows about trump's russia ties 23 shares

a top aide to hillary clinton urged the fbi on tuesday to disclose what it knows about any ties between donald trump and russia, accusing the agency of unfairly publicizing its inquiry into clinton's email practices while staying quiet about the republican presidential candidate.
the federal bureau of investigation opened a preliminary inquiry in recent months into allegations that trump or his associates might have had questionable dealings with russian people or businesses, but found no evidence to warrant opening a full investigation, according to sources familiar with the matter. the agency has not publicly discussed the probe.
a week before election day, the clinton campaign was trying to contain damage from the announcement by fbi director james comey on friday that his agency was looking into newly discovered emails that might relate to clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.
clinton has voiced confidence the fbi will not find anything problematic.
clinton campaign manager robby mook questioned why the fbi director had not released any information about the agency's russia inquiries.
more... what will hillary clinton do for india? not much and here's why clinton's policies look like a death sentence for americans 10 things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted ""if you're in the business of releasing information about investigations on presidential candidates, release everything you have on donald trump. release the information on his connections to the russians,"" mook said on cnn.
the fbi inquiry reviewed allegations that trump or his associates might have violated the foreign corrupt practices act or engaged in contacts or commerce with people in russia who are subject to u.s. or international financial sanctions.
the u.s. government has blamed russia for cyber attacks on democratic party organizations. democrats criticize trump for taking what they say is a pro-russia foreign policy stance.
russia's possible role in the campaign again came into focus when online magazine slate said a group of computer scientists had been alarmed by records showing thousands of apparent connection attempts between an email server operated on behalf of the trump organization and computers inside a russian company, alfa bank in moscow.
trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks said the server, which had been used to send out hotel marketing material, had been dormant for years.
prominent u.s. cyber security company fireeye said it had been hired by alfa bank to investigate the records and had been granted access to the banks systems in moscow to look for evidence of any relationship with trumps company or any signs of hacking or infection. fireeye said so far it had found no emails being sent back and forth or any other link.",8,736270,fake

"malala announced that she plans to become prime minister of pakistan videos malala announced that she plans to become prime minister of pakistan at a conference this month in the united arab emirates, malala announced that she intends to one day be the prime minister of pakistan.  november 1, 2016 be sociable, share! malala yousafzai gestures as she speaks to an audience during a discussion of her book, i am malala hosted by the john f. kennedy library and held at boston college high school saturday, oct. 12, 2013, in dorchester, mass. ap photojessica rinaldi 
malala yousufzai is a remarkable young woman who has made headlines and is known globally for the brave work she does in pakistan, her home country. her fight for the right for everyone to have a proper education, especially women, has put her life at risk many times and she even survived an assassination attempt where she was shot in the head. 
when she was just 17, she won the nobel peace prize and her book, i am malala, is a national bestseller. now, at the age of 19, she is still working harder than ever to improve education in both pakistan and other countries worldwide. one of her most recent moves was opening a school for refugee girls aged 14-18 in lebanon, on the border of syria. 
at a conference this month in the united arab emirates, malala announced that she intends to one day be the prime minister of pakistan. she said that when she grew up, women were really only allowed to be doctors, teachers, and housewives. however, her education and activism has helped her see the world and her place in it different. when i saw women role models, it broadened my vision. i saw benazir bhutto as a woman leader who was twice the prime minister of pakistan. i heard about women athletes, women astronauts, women artists, women entrepreneurs  it allowed me to recognize the potential that i had, and that i can have as a woman, to achieve anything in my life, she said. my dream changed from becoming a doctor to becoming the prime minister of pakistan. it may seem prestigious to be a doctor as a female in pakistan, which it certainly is, the job does come with strings attached. though the huge majority of medical students are female, only 23 percent of registered doctors are women. this is because being a doctor or even in medical school is a big selling point for marriage proposals, so the majority of women wind up getting married and not working as doctors. the ratio of medical students and their propensity for excelling more than their male counterparts is likely culturally-driven as well. one fifth-year medical student gave his opinion on the issue boys go out, hang out with their friends, he said. girls cant go out as much, so they stay at home and rote-learn. malala can truly do anything she sets her mind to, whether it be going to medical school, becoming prime minister , or continuing with her activist efforts. this young woman has so far stunned the world into listening what she has to say as she raises awareness about what a lack of education can do to women in hers and other countries. education for girls is necessary to improve the world and the quality of life for people everywhere, and malala will not rest until significant changes are made to include girls in school. this work by true activist is licensed under a creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike international license.",112,736269,fake

a hillary clinton-supporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a 20,000 donation funneled through a belize bank to use in this years presidential election campaign  until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by james okeefes project veritas action. 
suddenly, the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donations overseas origin and decided to return it. 
thats one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by okeefe called rigging the election. 
okeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with bob creamer, who was a staffer at americans united for change, a group supporting clinton for president, until the videos started appearing last week. 
he said creamer, who boasted of working directly for the clinton campaign, directed that the 20,000 donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops. 
okeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves. 
creamer was clear about his ties to clinton, stating, every morning i am on a call at 1030 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters. 
sign the precedent-setting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton! 
project veritas first video explained how the clinton campaign uses hidden connections to incite violence at donald trump rallies. its second video showed plans for step-by-step voter fraud and the third exposed prohibited communications between hillary clintons campaign, the dnc and the nonprofit americans united for change. 
the fourth video breaks down the process of the long-term investigation. it comes after creamers announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. 
okeefe and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission. 
among the revelations in the latest video was creamer was boasting of his close links to president obama. 
oh, barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics, i mean the second one, i mean the first was good, too. i was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect, he said. hes a pro, ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago. 
when asked whether a potential donor could meet obama, creamer said ok, you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in 98 days, 97. i was just at an event with him in chicago, friday of last week, he is just as good as ever. i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues, helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. i mean, for immigration reform for the  the health care bill, trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues. 
explained project veritas the more that was promised to creamer, the more access project veritas action journalists seemed to get. project veritas actions 20,000 investment paid off. the story was solid. robert creamer, scott foval, jenna price from the dnc, brad woodhouse from aufc, cesar vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous pva videos. 
in the first video, foval, a democratic operative, boasted of what he called conflict engagement, or sending protesters to disrupt trump events. 
were starting anarchy here, he said. and he needs to understand that were starting anarchy. 
in the second video, creamer explained clintons direct control over those disruption operations. 
in the end it was the candidate, hillary clinton, the future president of the united states, who wanted ducks on the ground, so by god we would get ducks on the ground, creamer said. 
creamer, the husband of democratic rep. jan schakowsky of illinois, has starred in several of the undercover videos. 
heres the third 
that video also revealed a direct conflict between what creamer was confirming  clintons active involvement in such decisions and campaigns  and the claim of her campaign manager, robby mook. 
mook told cnn over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and clinton. 
sign the precedent-setting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton! 
these individuals no longer have a relationship with the dnc, he said. theyve never had a relationship with the clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened i think in february of last year. 
they did not have a contract with the dnc until june. but putting all that aside, this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign, it is edited so we dont know what the full context is. and theres no evidence whatsoever  that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the dnc. 
his comments 
after confirming it was clinton or wanted ducks on the ground, creamer warned undercover project veritas journalists, dont repeat that to anybody. 
creamer ran democracy partners, a consulting company with ties to clinton. 
he has been to the white house 342 times while obama has been president, including 47 meetings directly with obama. 
okeefes organization reported that the coordination between the campaign, the dnc and the americans united for change smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures. 
last week , project veritas filed a complaint with the federal election commission asking for an investigation into the clinton campaigns criminal conspiracy. 
the filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means, such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally. 
the video have resulted already in two democratic operatives losing their jobs. 
editors note be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos. 
one is scott foval, who had worked for people for the american way, a george soros-funded group, and more recently with americans united for change. 
in the video, he said you know what? weve been busing people in to deal with you fing aes for 50 years, and were not going to stop now. 
also, he said he and his agents are starting anarchy by creating conflict engagement  in the lines at trump rallies. 
also out of work is creamer. 
see the second video 
talk-radio icon rush limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome. 
every trump rally would feature none of this violence unless the democrats were paying for it. i think its a big deal, folks. the media is complicit. they know who these people are.  theyre in on it. theyre part of the game.  none of its organic. none of its natural. none of its real. every bit of it is bought and paid for. 
democrats cant leave elections to chance because they know that, despite the way it may look, the majority of americans would not support them if they knew who they are.

"state that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes state that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes 'this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority' published 5 mins ago bob unruh about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in 2006 after nearly three decades with the associated press, as well as several upper midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. print dr. eric walsh photo first liberty 
the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church. 
but dr. eric walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons. 
walshs ordeal began in may 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventh-day adventist church. 
lee rudd, the agencys human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately. two days later, walsh was fired. 
at that point, lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks, chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the constitution. order today! 
now, in response to walshs lawsuit, the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, copies of his sermon notes and transcripts. 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church, said jeremy dys, senior counsel for first liberty. 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons, said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so. 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen. 
the mayor at the time, annise parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . 
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case, welch said, i cant believe im saying this, but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from  us. 
welch, the executive director of the texas pastor council, said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons. 
first, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city, he said. also, the state is demanding much more material sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible. its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study. this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in america. 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee, part of the nations largest public policy womens group with 500,000 members, also came to walshs defense. 
penny nance, ceo, said the words of reverend dr. martin luther king, jr., that, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapo-like tactics of his native state. the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, dr. eric walsh, is indeed a threat to every american, whatever our religious beliefs. 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share? 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him. 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon, dys told fox news when the case was filed. he was fired for something he said in a sermon. if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything. the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist. 
state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing. 
the telephone call was between dr. patrick oneal, an agency official, and kate pfirman, an agency financial officer. the call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. 
pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold, because i dont want to say very much. if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through, its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway. 
then there was laughter from both parties. 
oneal then said to inform walsh, youre out, and there was another round of laughter. 
its very funny, pfirman said.

a shocking video has emerged showing the moment a protective student knocked out a classmate who had just attacked their female teacher. the footage shows that the teacher was trying to break up a fight between two students  one in a red hoodie and one in a black hoodie  when the boy in the red turns around and hits her in the face. the teacher, dressed in white and wearing glasses, appears to fall to the ground after being hit, and then leaves the classroom. 
then, a third student comes in and punches the boy in head, sending him straight down to the ground. the third student is heard saying watch the f out, you just hit the fucking teacher. he then adds chill your s, you just hit the fing teacher, you dont fing do that. who the f do you think you are? 
the teacher then reappears in the room, and appears relatively unscathed. she tells the group to stop fighting and separate.he just fing hit you, thats not cool, says the boy that came to her defense.its not cool, the teacher replies. it is unclear where the video was filmed or what school was involved, however the clip was spreading quickly on social media on wednesday after appearing on the website liveleak. some viewers questioned whether the boy in red may have mistakenly hit the teacher, believing she were the other one of the students. however others said he clearly meant to hit the woman.

"boom! former secretary of defense canada puts bomb under corrupt banking system! posted by madeline  oct 26, 2016  2016 , daily blog  0  thanks gre!
bovendien 
former defense minister of canada, paul hellyer, has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty. ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement, a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet. paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement. with this convention, which comes out of the hat of the international bankers, 62 families will obtain control over almost the entire world. constitutions of member countries will no longer apply, only the will of the 62 families the elite will apply. 
the lawsuit was officially filed on october 21 of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments; the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign, execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels. 2 the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forum-protected by the division of powers under the constitution act, 1867 
most of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law, 1867 the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes; and 
ceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system, and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms , and over-rides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health, education, social services, and public utilities-including the elimination of subsidies, monopolies, and state enterprises for public welfare. in short, the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens. 
various provisions of ceta violated constitutional built-rights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health, education, social services and public funds, including the termination of subsidies , monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest. in short, the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants. 
but this is not all! paul hellyer, which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world, his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world, the international bankers, international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only 62 families. 
paul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers, yet not so long ago. until 1974 the canadian government expressed its money itself, there was no such thing as inflation, poverty and debt. canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time. life was good, cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do. from one day to the issued money creation in 1974 the central banks and money was no longer free. within a few years, canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes. paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend. this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education, health, housing, etc. can be paid without causing debts. paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version! he lets no grass grow, does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years, paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat. 
now the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this. 
dear readers. this could be the big break. this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers, the same applies. we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people. the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it. we want a better and fairer world, then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for! 
privatized money is the reason for all wars, privatized money is the cause of poverty, oppression, exploitation, neglect of our elderly and less fortunate. privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet. now is the chance to get out from under the yoke, to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children. now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over 100 years with one goal, to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer.

"8 things to keep under the radar during a blackout bill white november 20, 2016 8 things to keep under the radar during a blackout 
major blackouts are becoming more and more common, according to data from the national energy administration. 
our aging power grid, along with ever-increasing demands for electric power are taking their toll on the electrical industrys ability to keep us all supplied with power. 
currently, the number of major blackouts per year doubles every five years. at that rate, we will soon find ourselves catching up with some third-world countries. we have an answer to help you out with this challenge. 
while the major reason for this is our aging power grid, the problem is much more complex than that. replacement of aging equipment is extremely expensive and the process filled with red tape. energy companies find themselves bogged down for years in the quagmire of conflicting government requirements, on both a state and national level. 
this problem is becoming worse, with the massive amount of regulations that the obama administration has promulgated through his presidency. 
the epa especially, has attacked the energy sector ruthlessly, especially the coal industry and coal power plants. 
but even this isnt really our biggest issue with the grid, although it is an important issue. the biggest issue is that the grid is highly vulnerable. 
as a large, decentralized network, spanning the country, it is virtually impossible to protect. even the minimal protections that are in place, have been proven to be ineffective. 
the fact is, our electrical grid is highly susceptible to damage, and its common knowledge that it is. 
any number of enemies could take out the grid, or larger portions of it, either through direct, kinetic terrorist attacks, cyber-warfare or a high-altitude emp. even the sun could take it out, with a coronal mass ejection. we had a near miss on that as recently as last year. 
with so much risk to our aging power grid, its not a matter of if were going to be faced by a major blackout or even a semi-permanent one, but when we will be faced with it. odds are catching up with us, bringing us to a place where we can all count on that happening to us sometime in our lives. 
clearly, preparing for such an event, regardless of how it happens, has to be part and parcel of our disaster preparation. 
anyone who chooses to ignore this possibility is merely putting themselves and their families in the massive group of people who dont prepare, because they expect the government to take care of them. in other words, they are planning on becoming victims of the blackout, rather than becoming ones who overcome the blackout. 
blackouts instill fear in people, as we all have a little bit of natural fear of the dark. mankind was created to live and function in the daylight, not the night. 
while we have learned and adapted to doing many things in the dark, a lot of that has been by overcoming the dark with artificial light. we simply function best, when we can see what we are doing. 
but what if youre the only one in your neighborhood who can see what youre doing? what if the lights go out, in a major blackout, and they stay out long enough that batteries in your neighbors flashlights go dead? 
when they are sitting in the dark, cold and hungry, how are you going to protect yourself? 
when the lights go out, so does everything else too. we depend on electricity for so many different things, that without it, society comes grinding to a standstill. 
not only do we lose the ability to do things at night, but we also lose our entire supply chain, because it depends on electricity for the flow of information, control, and even pumping the gas into the trucks and airplanes that make the deliveries. 
so losing power means losing pretty much everything we depend on in our modern, technology-based lives. 
we must always keep in the back of our minds that desperate people do desperate things. when the lights go out and the heat goes off, that feeling of desperation will begin to take root in their hearts. bit by bit it will grow, fed by each and every thing that they find missing from their lives. 
when they cant get gas for their car, the desperation will grow a bit more. when they cant buy food, because the grocery store shelves are empty, the desperation will increase. and when they turn on the faucet and nothing comes out, because there isnt any electricity for the pumps, their cups of desperation may very well overflow. 
the best thing that any of us can do in such a situation is ensure that we dont let anyone around us know that were better off than they are. 
opsec will have to become our byword, as we quietly try to survive in the midst of them. specifically, there are a number of things we will want to hide from those around us. 
1. the means to create light 
the first thing that people will notice is also one of the hardest to hide light. thats the first thing that anyone is going to turn on, when the power goes out. whether it is flashlights, candles or oil-burning lamps, theyre all going to turn on some light. 
the problem is, their light will go out after a short time, perhaps a day or two. after that, any light you have will be extremely conspicuous. 
if the windows of every house on your street are dark and even a little light is coming out of yours, your house will seem like a lighthouse to those around. their lack of light will make yours seem even greater. 
extreme light discipline will have to be the order of the day. youre going to have to hide your light, and avoid using it in places where they can see. one key component of this will have to be blackout curtains on over all your windows. 
regular curtains wont be enough, because they will look like they are lit up to people on the outside. you need curtains that are dark enough and heavy enough to block the light, so that your windows appear dark, like theirs. 
2. power generation 
many of us have invested in either solar power or wind power, both to augment the electrical power we buy from our local utility company and as a means of producing power in a blackout. 
but a roof full of solar panels or a wind turbine sticking 30 feet up in the air in your backyard are easy to see, letting everyone know that you have power, when they dont. 
thats going to attract people like moths to an open flame. about the only thing that could be worse is a gas powered generator. 
even those who arent looking for your solar panels will hear that, especially considering how quiet it will be without cars running down the roads and entertainment systems blaring out music. 
while i wouldnt want to dissuade you from investing in solar or wind power, in the midst of a blackout youll actually be better off with something stealthy. a portable system, with the solar panels at ground level would fit that bill, as a fenced backyard would hide it pretty well. 
you can quietly provide power and keep your family safe during an outage   hurry up and grab this offer right now to pay in monthly installments! 
3. solar powered anything 
speaking of solar power, pretty much anything that is solar powered is going to be in high demand. even if all you have is a solar charger for your phone, you can count on everyone around you wanting to use it. more major solar powered devices, such as a solar oven, will become very high on the list of things that people will want to steal. 
of course, the longer the blackout lasts, the more people there will be who will be willing to turn to stealing. so the threat for your solar oven being stolen will actually increase as time goes on, requiring more and more diligence to protect it. 
4. food and the ability to cook that food 
as i already mentioned, the supermarket shelves will be bare, which will force people to use up whatever food they have stored within their homes. but what will they do when theyve eaten the last of the popcorn and scraped the peanut butter jar dry? 
most preppers believe that people will turn to attacking one another and raiding others homes in search of food at this time. small gangs will form, either neighbors working together or people who are friends who decide they can help one another. 
in either case, these gangs will be looking for food, more than anything else, and they wont be reluctant to break into homes and hit the residents over the head to get it. 
not only will they be searching for food, but for the ability to cook that food. a large portion of the things we eat need to be cooked in order to be edible. 
but cooking in modern times is done with electricity or natural gas, both of which will be conspicuous by their absence. barbecue grills will become the number one means of cooking at least until people run out of propane or charcoal. 
thats when the solar oven is going to become popular. even without knowing how to use one, people will be quick to steal an unattended solar oven, thinking that they can figure it out. 
one of the problems with hiding your food is that cooking creates odors which will attract attention. 
youll need to be careful about this, avoiding cooking in ways that create odors. meats are the worst for this, as they produce the most odor when cooking. but by cooking them in soups, you reduce the odor that passes through the air. 
5. water and the means to pump it out of the ground 
we really cant talk about food, without talking about water as well. water is a higher survival priority than food is, so people will be desperate for it much quicker. 
if youve got a river, lake or canal near enough to draw water out of, youll probably be safe. but if not, and people find out you have a well, theyll be knocking on your door. 
at that time, youll have to make a decision. will you provide water to your neighbors or not. a lot of that will depend on how good your well is and how effective a pump you have. 
sharing water might be great for public relations, but theres a danger there too. some will thank you, while others might see it as an opportunity to take over your well. 
6. heat for your home 
one of the worst times to have the lights go out is in the wintertime. then, light isnt peoples biggest concern, heat is. 
every year people die during the cold northern winters, either because there is no power to heat their homes or because they cant afford to pay for heat. sadly, this mostly happens to the elderly, who are the most vulnerable people in society. 
when the power is out and people get cold, theres a natural tendency to gather together, seeking to share whatever heat they have, even if its only body heat. that means that theyll come knocking on your door, if they think you have heat. 
depending on how you are heating your home, doing so might be difficult to hide. 
burning wood, which is what most of us are planning to do, produces smoke, as well as the smell of burning wood. just like the steak cooking on the barbecue grill, that smell will attract attention. 
one thing you can do to help alleviate this is to buy firewood that produces little smoke and odor. different woods burn differently, producing different amounts of heat, as well as smelling differently. 
youll need to experiment a bit, but if you can find a low-odor wood, it will help. 
7. fuel for your car 
as the blackout progresses, one thing you can be sure of is that people will begin to migrate. the lack of news about what is happening elsewhere will cause people to wonder if things would be better, if they could just get out of the area where the blackout is. so, some will leave, trying to find a better place. 
of course, that means leaving in their cars and trucks. but without the gas pumps working, thats going to be hard to do. even so, theyll try mostly by stealing gas from others. 
some will siphon it out of gas tanks and others will try to pump it out of the gas stations tanks with a manual pump. 
the best thing you can do to keep from losing your gas and even your car is to hide them. if you dont have room in your garage, then put them in the backyard. 
if you cant do that, then drain out the gas yourself and disable the car. removing a tire and the battery, as well as allowing the car to get covered with a layer of dust, will go a long way towards making it look unusable. 
8. guns  ammo 
finally, it would be a good idea to keep your guns and ammo out of sight. some might think that being obviously armed would be a deterrent to attack. 
while that might be true for the more timid in society, it would be just as likely to make others think that you must have something in your home worth protecting. for those people, your guns would be an advertisement, not a deterrent. 
that doesnt mean that you should be unarmed, merely that you shouldnt advertise the fact. those will be dangerous times and you may very well need your guns to protect yourself. so, keep them close at hand, but keep them hidden at the same time. 
most people who carry concealed are actually against open carry of firearms. thats not because they dont agree with the implied right under the second amendment, but rather that they want the element of surprise. 
if someone doesnt know what youre carrying, they cant prepare effectively to counter it. that gives you a huge tactical advantage, when the time comes and you bring your guns out of hiding.

"sorry liberalsyou can stop with the petitionshillary did not win the popular vote go to article dear abby, i supported a woman i knew had a history of criminal activity, who is married to a rapist and who left 4 men to die in benghazi. she put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. she is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, i supported her anyhow, because shes a democrat and has a vagina. someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if i just signed a petition. they said that trump really didnt win, because hillary won the popular vote. is that true? 
okay, lets address this hillary might win the popular vote, isnt that electoral college situation just awful thing head on. 
no, its not awful. its great, and it protects the importance of your vote. its also uniquely american and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the founding fathers. 
first of all, shes probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. she may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. 
states dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. if there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. if the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots arent counted. 
who votes by absentee ballot? students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. the historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33 republican. in 2000, when al gore won the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in california alone. a 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million republican vote advantage, so bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from californias uncounted absentee ballots alone! so much for gores 500,000 popular vote victory. that was the headline on the n.y. times, and it was the lead story on nbc nightly news, right? no? youre kidding. 
getting back to the win the popular votelose the electoral college scenario thank g-d we have that, or else california and n.y. would determine every election. every time. 
but the electoral college brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do madison ave. execs and factory workers in tennessee. 
shortcomings? sure. the e.c. can make an r vote meaningless in a very few heavily d states or vice versa. but without the electoral college, the countrys entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states.  american thinker comment on this article via your facebook account comment on this article via your disqus account follow us on facebook!",0,736281,real

every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the democrats. coincidentally, the democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. in 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in mitt romney. this year, the out-of-touch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross. 
the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top .01 percent. the rest of us will be their servants. 
the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class, the middle class who will soon be working class and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
look to mexico for your future  or any third world country. or to univisions jorge ramos. the ruling class in mexico is composed of european-looking, white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their spanish names in return. british settlers in america brought women with them. 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men.  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim. the victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family. 
one american detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing. 
when it comes to multiculturalism, you cant say, we love the empanadas  but we dont want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . this isnt an a la carte menu. we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing. 
as described in excruciating detail in adios, america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole, our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder!  when its committed by immigrants. 
thus, for example, where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest, child rape, the chattanooga tenn. times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling. 
and where i would have used the headline, illegal alien repeatedly raped 14-year-old girl at job site, the commercial dispatch in columbus, mississippi, went with the more subtle, columbus resident charged with molestation. 
immigrant women arrive in america, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
in 1989, brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood. the female head of the asian-american legal defense and education fund, margaret fung, applauded the ruling. 
somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. anything to keep the third world immigration flowing! 
in 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. 
when the news first broke, shaneequa jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants! 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for austin men. or two. 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack

 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online, july 24, 2013 
needless to say, the new york times did not cover the mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. 
the ultimate primer on the blue-collar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome! 
by contrast, the times, and every major american news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was 11. but she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. 
those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. the defendants were african-american. the victim was mexican. 
that time, there were articles in the huffington post, gq, slate, salon and mother jones. it even made the new york times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. 
similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur, alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. one suspect was african-american, the other was a hispanic immigrant. only one made the newspaper. guess which one? 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes!, journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men. 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues. definitely not islam! 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened.  this attack also had nothing to do with islam. 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges. we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not.  in my experience, muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment. 
perhaps american men could do better, but, as american women may soon discover they never had it so good. 
manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america. they are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich. the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher. 
our country will be zimbabwe, but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe!

"mainstream media ignoring 75 lawsuits against trump to focus on clinton emails by hrafnkell haraldsson on tue, nov 1st, 2016 at 800 am ""last spring...new york had to take legal action to collect 8,578 in unpaid taxes on the trump-owned company that owns the trademark boeing 757""   
we looked yesterday at kurt eichenwalds revelation that donald trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails. that is hardly trumps only misdeed, but how many people realize that donald trump, at this moment, has 75  seventy-five  legal issues hanging over his head. 
hes lying 20 to 35 times a day and has his followers  and with much less excuse, the mainstream media  thoroughly distracted by the clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities. 
usa today reported at the end of october that just two weeks before election day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by usa today. 
it will surprise no one, because trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster , that one trump case, over non-payment of tips to caterers at trump soho hotel in new york city, is scheduled to go to trial a week before election day. 
if one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that trump does not pay his bills. earlier, we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts, having decided that the contractor had been paid enough, even though it wasnt the agreed-upon amount. trump got nailed by the court for 300k in attorneys fees in that case. 
just a few examples from usa todays investigation 
trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses angry members at his jupiter, fla. golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. theres a fraud case brought by trump university students who say the moguls company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course. trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. a disgruntled gop political consultant sued for 4 million saying trump defamed her. another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages. 
as pointed out by usa todays nick penzenstadler and john kelly, these lawsuits will dog trump into the white house, should he win. he will have no immunity because he is president. and america  and the world  will be treated to the spectacle of the president of the united states having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs. 
there are harassment cases, sex discrimination lawsuits, fraud, unpaid bills, racist comments, defamation, cases involving trump university. as usa today notes, as recently as last springnew york had to take legal action to collect 8,578 in unpaid taxes on the trump-owned company that owns the trademark boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country. 
and those 75 cases will likely grow. 
trump has promised, after all, to sue the new york times and each of the women  nymag maintains an exhaustive list  who have accused him of sexual assault. 
usa today says it spent six months researching court records. the exclusive analysis, they say, found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits. the cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the white house. 
donald trump claims clinton is tainted. he claims clintons emails are bigger than watergate. the other day tweeted , we must not let crookedhillary take her criminal scheme into the oval office. draintheswamp. 
this comes from the man who would turn the 1600 pennsylvania avenue into a morality no-go zone. 
all the facts  including the new disclosures about trumps ties to a russian server and his potentially illegal ploy to avoid paying taxes  make it clear that if trump the deadbeat liar drains the swamp, he will be the first one down the drain.",133,736269,real
"trump elected as president  risks and opportunities evgeny sribnyjj  shutterstock.com 
so it has happened hillary did not win! i say that instead of saying that trump won because i consider the former even more important than the latter. why? because i have no idea whatsoever what trump will do next. i do, however, have an excellent idea of what hillary would have done war with russia. trump most likely wont do that. in fact, he specifically said in his acceptance speech 
i want to tell the world community that while we will always put americas interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone  all people and all other nations. we will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict . 
and putins reply was immediate 
we heard the statements he made as candidate for president expressing a desire to restore relations between our countries. we realise and understand that this will not be an easy road given the level to which our relations have degraded today, regrettably. but, as i have said before, it is not russias fault that our relations with the united states have reached this point. 
russia is ready to and seeks a return to full-format relations with the united states. let me say again, we know that this will not be easy, but are ready to take this road, take steps on our side and do all we can to set russian-us relations back on a stable development track. 
this would benefit both the russian and american peoples and would have a positive impact on the general climate in international affairs, given the particular responsibility that russia and the us share for maintaining global stability and security. 
this exchange, right there, is enough of a reason for the entire planet to rejoice at the defeat of hillary and the victory of trump. 
will trump now have the courage, willpower and intelligence to purge the us executive from the neocon cabal which has been infiltrating it for decades now? will he have the strength to confront an extremely hostile congress and media? or will he try to meet them halfway and naively hope that they will not use their power, money and influence to sabotage his presidency? 
i dont know. nobody does. 
one of the first signs to look for will be the names and backgrounds of the folks he will appoint in his new administration. especially his chief of staff and secretary of state. 
i have always said that the choice for the lesser evil is morally wrong and pragmatically misguided. i still believe that. in this case, however, the greater evil was thermonuclear war with russia and the lesser evil just might turn out to be one which will gradually give up the empire to save the usa rather than sacrifice the usa for the needs of the empire. in the case of hillary vs trump the choice was simple war or peace. 
trump can already be credited with am immense achievement his campaign has forced the us corporate media to show its true face  the face of an evil, lying, morally corrupt propaganda machine. the american people by their vote have rewarded their media with a gigantic fck you!  a vote of no-confidence and total rejection which will forever demolish the credibility of the empires propaganda machine. 
i am not so naive as to not realize that billionaire donald trump is also one of the 1ers, a pure product of the us oligarchy. but neither am i so ignorant of history to forget that elites do turn on each other , especially when their regime is threatened. do i need to remind anybody that putin also came from the soviet elites?! 
ideally, the next step would be for trump and putin to meet, with all their key ministers, in a long, camp david like week of negotiations in which everything, every outstanding dispute, should be put on the table and a compromise sought in each case. paradoxically, this could be rather easy the crisis in europe is entirely artificial, the war in syria has an absolutely obvious solution, and the international order can easily accommodate a united states which would  deal fairly with everyone, with everyone  all people and all other nations  and  seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict . the truth is that the usa and russia have no objective reasons for conflict  only ideological issues resulting directly from the insane ideology of messianic imperialism of those who believe, or pretend to believe, that the usa is an indispensable nation. what the world wants  needs  is the usa as a normal nation. 
the worst case? trump could turn out to be a total fraud. i personally very much doubt it, but i admit that this is possible. more likely is that he just wont have the foresight and courage to crush the neocons and that he will try to placate them. if he does so, they will instead crush him. it is a fact that while administrations have changed every 4 or 8 years, the regime in power has not, and that us internal and foreign policies have been amazingly consistent since the end of wwii. will trump finally bring not just a new administration but real regime change? i dont know. 
make no mistake  even if trump does end up disappointing those who believed in him what happened today has dealt a death blow to the empire. the occupy wall street did not succeed in achieving anything tangible, but the notion of rule of the 1 did emerge from that movement and it stayed. this is a direct blow to the credibility and legitimacy of the entire socio-political order of the usa far from being a democracy, it is a plutocracyoligarchy  everybody pretty much accepts that today. likewise, the election of trump has already proved that the us media is a prostitute and that the majority of the american people hate their ruling class. again, this is a direct blow to the credibility and legitimacy of the entire socio-political order. one by one the founding myths of the us empire are crashing down and what remains is a system which can only rule by force. order it now 
alexander solzhenitsyn used to say that regimes can be measured on a spectrum which ranges from regimes whose authority is their power and regimes whose power in in their authority. in the case of the usa we now clearly can see that the regime has no other authority than its power and that makes it both illegitimate and unsustainable. 
finally, whether the us elites can accept this or not, the us empire is coming to an end. with hillary, we would have had a titanic-like denial up to the last moment which might well have come in the shape of a thermonuclear mushroom over washington dc. trump, however, might use the remaining power of the usa to negotiate the us global draw-down thereby getting the best possible conditions for his country. frankly, i am pretty sure that all the key world leaders realize that it is in their interest to make as many reasonable concessions to trump as possible and work with him, rather than to deal with the people whom he just removed from power. 
if trump can stick to his campaign promises he will find solid and reliable partners in vladimir putin and xi jinping. neither russia nor china have anything at all to gain from a confrontation or, even less so, a conflict with the usa. will trump have the wisdom to realize this and use it for the benefit of the usa? or will he continue with his anti-chinese and anti-iranian rhetoric?

"pollster sees no early impact from comey clinton fbi email letter in swing states a pollster who is in the field in two swing states is reporting that he is seeing no early impact from the fbi reviewing new emails in the hillary clinton investigation in two swing states.

 geoff garin geoffgarin october 29, 2016 
it is still early, but if this were the election shifting news that republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate. the reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign, it will be because republicans are coming back to trump. 
there are few undecided voters in this election, and even if all the republican base come home to trump, it wont be enough for trump to win, because he is losing where the presidential election is really held. trump is getting crushed at the state level. 
republicans have been trying to build hillary clintons emails into a story for years, and they have failed at every turn. 
hillary clinton led the election while under congressional investigation. hillary clinton led the election while under fbi investigation. hillary clinton is leading the election today. the message that republicans and the media dont want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails, and they dont care. 
voters are smarter than republicans and the press give them credit for. the hillary clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that clinton did anything wrong. 
if the polls tighten a little, this will be the best news in the world for hillary clinton and democrats, because it will destroy any potential for democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls.

"russian analysis shows western-backed terrorists using chemical weapons against civilians russian analysis shows western-backed terrorists using chemical weapons against civilians in yet another blow to the credibility of the western corporate media and the anti-syria propaganda blitz by brandon tuberville   950 am est 
although the 1070 apartment complex was liberated by the syrian government a few days ago, the terrorists have been repeatedly shelling the area with indiscriminate missiles in order to kill civilians attempting to flee terrorist control as well as firing missiles at syrian military personnel. many of these missiles have been filled with poisonous gas which the russian center has identified as being chlorine and white phosphorous. 
dozens of people have been injured as a result of the chemical munitions and have been hospitalized for treatment. chlorine and white phosphorous both cause extremely painful deaths. 
while the united states government has repeatedly accused the syrian military of using chemical weapons against terrorists and even civilians, not one shred of evidence has been produced to back up these claims. 
however, not only have a number of internationally recognized experts demonstrated clearly that the terrorists have used chemical weapons against both civilians and syrian military soldiers, the terrorist forces have admitted as much by videotaping themselves testing the weapons and threatening to use them against those who oppose them. 
notably, all of these substances were banned by the chemical weapons convention on january 13, 1993. 
the russian center has established a mobile analysis center in aleppo in order to test samples quickly but the samples will soon be sent to the radiological, chemical, and biological center in moscow. this center is accredited by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons. 
in yet another blow to the credibility of the western corporate media and the anti-syria propaganda blitz it has maintained since early 2011, experts from the russian center for radiological, chemical, and biological defense have recently announced that analysis of the shells fired by terrorists at the 1070 apartment complex in aleppo contained chemical weapons. 
this new revelation brings western propaganda crashing to ground in regards to the claims that it is assads government using chemical weapons and that the terrorists have no access to them. 
rapid sample analysis shows that the toxic substances in the militants artillery ammunition were chlorine and white phosphorus, an analyst from the center said.",93,736283,fake

on that computer we have the documents which the fbi is now claiming are of some import to the clinton email scandal. no one knows what the documents are, or why they are relevant, and officials who have made statements on it have been pretty cagey. one said that it had something to do with collusion between the state department and the fbi. 
the thing here is, i dont really see how there could be anything on the laptop that wasnt already reviewed by the fbi. unless i guess its some of those 33,000 that are missing though i personally have a hard time believing they never recovered those. 
so the official story is that they found something on this laptop so damning that they had to immediately reopen the investigation. something that couldnt wait 11 days. 
however, much more likely in my opinion is the fbi revolt theory. that theory would be that the fbi agents were freaking out about the miscarriage of justice, and in some way forced the hand of comey. because it seems to me that the guy already totally buried so much criminality, that there is no way, whatever it was, that he wouldnt personally be willing to bury it. 
overall, details are very scarce at this present hour. 
but something is going to come out in the next couple of days. you can be certain of that. if the agents themselves pressured comey into doing this, then they believe in justice, meaning they are on the trump train. so one of them is probably waiting to leak it to the media himself  just at the right time. 
but get this if hillary goes down, obama is going down with her. i can guarantee it. 
if hillary goes down, the entire system comes down. 
donald trump has blown the whole thing up. 
there is swamp juicy everywhere, and everyone is seeing just how sickening the whole thing is. 
the only thing left to do is drain it.",42,736266,fake
"when trump attacked the khans, he didnt know what a gold star family was by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat, oct 29th, 2016 at 405 pm you do know you just attacked a gold star family? one adviser warned trump. ""what's that?"" he asked. share on twitter print this post 
gabriel sherman writes at new york mag that when donald trump attacked the khan family over khizr khans speech at the democratic national convention, he had no idea what a gold star family was. 
you will remember that khizr khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to donald trump, let me ask you, have you even read the united states consitution? i will gladly lend you my copy. in this document, look for the words liberty and equal protection of the law. 
the fallout was predictable. donald trump, openly criticized, lost it. he attacked the khans religious beliefs, saying if you look at his wife, she was standing there. she had nothing to say. she probably, maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say. 
now it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing. because he is ignorant, and because, as mark cuban has observed, he isnt interested in learning anything. gabriel sherman explains 
you do know you just attacked a gold star family? one adviser warned trump. trump didnt know what a gold star family was whats that? he asked. to trump, khizr khan and his wife, ghazala, were enemies who had said something mean about him, just like rosie odonnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years. wasnt it his right to respond?  the election is about the american people, its not about you,  manafort told trump, according to a person briefed on the conversation. trump countered with breitbarts report on khans purported belief in sharia.  hes not running for president,  manafort shot back.  the clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message.  
of course, trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasnt prepared to take the blame. instead, as sherman reveals, he took it out on manafort in front of his senior advisors, including ailes. according to trump, manafort wasnt able to get the media to focus on the right stuff. 
no wonder, when trump refuses to take manaforts advice and focus on the right stuff. this is not to defend manafort, who is at least as despicable as his boss, but it serves as an example of how trumps first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic. 
it was one of donald trumps most visible joe mccarthy moments, and his response to khizr khan actually reinforced the point khan was trying to make. 
stopping and thinking are foreign to him. and if you are not astonished by the appalling ignorance on display here, you should not be. this is all in keeping with a party that prides itself on ignorance rather than facts.",133,736266,real
"nato chief downplays concerns over formation of joint european army eu nato secretary general jens stoltenberg speaks during a press conference at the organizations headquarters in brussels on october 26, 2016. photo by afp 
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg has downplayed suggestions that eu military buildup might undermine the western alliance as the bid to establish an independent european army appears to gain momentum. 
""i strongly believe it is absolutely possible to strengthen european defense without duplicating efforts by nato,"" stoltenberg said on thursday, adding, eu leaders have also conveyed that this is not about the eu doing collective defense, the eu building structures that would compete with nato."" 
stoltenberg made the remarks following a meeting between european union's foreign policy chief, federica mogherini, and nato defense ministers in brussels. 
mogherini, one of the strongest supporters of a joint european defense force, has drawn up a global strategy for the bloc, which says the 27-nation bloc should seek ""strategic autonomy"" to face multiple security threats, ranging from conventional to hybrid warfare, from the ukraine crisis to syria, from poverty in africa to massive refugee flows. 
the proposal has sparked concerns that the bloc is seeking a more independent role. 
mogherini on thursday said the bloc does have civilian and military operations, such as in africa or in the mediterranean, and needs to improve command and control centers to run them. 
she, however, attempted to downplay concerns that the formation of an eu force could lead to the duplication of nato functions, saying, ""but this can be done ... without any kind of overlapping or duplication with nato."" nato secretary general jens stoltenberg r chairs a nato defense ministers' meeting, flanked by eu foreign policy chief, federica mogherini 2nd l, and nato deputy secretary general rose gottemoeller 2nd r, at the nato headquarters in brussels on october 27, 2016. photo by afp 
in july, an eu strategy document said that the bloc should look to create greater military autonomy from nato. it stated the eu could no longer rely on the alliance regarding various security issues and must instead develop an ability to act autonomously if and when necessary. 
european commission president jean-claude juncker was the first to call for the establishment of an eu army in march 2015. 
""a joint eu army would show the world that there would never again be a war between eu countries, he said.

"bad news for republicans as court intervenes in their voter intimidation scheme by sarah jones on tue, nov 1st, 2016 at 1230 am the united states district court in new jersey ordered discovery on donald trump and the rnc's poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on november 4th, just days before the november 8th election. share on twitter print this post 
republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for voter fraud. 
the united states district court in new jersey ordered discovery on donald trump and the rncs poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on november 4th, just days before the november 8th election. 
the order demands affidavits from several parties, including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendants rncs efforts with the trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country, as indicated by kellyanne conway. 
affidavits are also demanded from several republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide voter fraud monitoring and poll monitoring, such as rnc member rob gleasons efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in philadelphia, pennsylvania and rnc member ronna romney mcdaniels efforts in michigan to prepare a massive, statewide anti-voter fraud effort. 
the rnc must also answer for governor mike pences comments that the trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure ballot integrity. 
this is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante. 
rick hasen at election law blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad, pretty broad discovery required in short order, with hearing on november 4. 
however, the judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the dnc given the time frame, but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes. 
the dnc filed a lawsuit against the republican national committee for violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over donald trumps claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters. 
donald trumps urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own often in urban areas to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isnt likely to stand for it. 
so now discovery has been court-ordered, which is just more bad news for republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the white house. 
its exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote. everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation. dont let anyone dissuade you from voting.

"oh, what a lovely war! written by philip giraldi tuesday november 8, 2016 the american people dont know very much about war even if washington has been fighting on multiple fronts since 911. the continental united states has not experienced the presence a hostile military force for more than 100 years and war for the current generation of americans consists largely of the insights provided by video games and movies. the pentagons invention of embedded journalists, which limits any independent media insight into what is going on overseas, has contributed to the rendering of war as some kind of abstraction. gone forever is anything like the press coverage of vietnam, with nightly news and other media presentations showing prisoners being executed and young girls screaming while racing down the street in flames. given all of that, it is perhaps no surprise that both hillary clinton and donald trump, neither of whom has served in uniform, should regard violence inflicted on people overseas with a considerable level of detachment. hillary is notorious for her assessment of the brutal killing of libyas moammar gaddafi, saying we came, we saw, he died. they both share to an extent the dominant new york-washington policy consensus view that dealing with foreigners can sometimes get a bit bloody, but that is a price that someone in power has to be prepared to pay. one of hillarys top advisers, former secretary of state madeleine albright, famously declared that the deaths of 500,000 iraqi children due to us led sanctions were worth it. in the election campaign there has, in fact, been little discussion of the issue of war and peace or even of americas place in the world, though trump did at one point note correctly that implementation of hillarys suggested foreign policy could escalate into world war iii. it has been my contention that the issue of war should be more front and center in the minds of americans when they cast their ballots as the prospect of an armed conflict in which little is actually at stake escalating and going nuclear could conceivably end life on this planet as we know it. with that in mind, it is useful to consider what the two candidates have been promising. first, hillary, who might reasonably be designated the establishments war candidate though she carefully wraps it in humanitarian liberal interventionism. as senator and secretary of state, hillary clinton has always viewed a foreign crisis as an opportunity to use aggressive measures to seek a resolution. she can always be relied upon to do something, a reflection of the neocon driven washington foreign policy consensus. hillary clinton and her advisors, who believe strongly in washingtons leadership role globally and embrace their own definition of american exceptionalism, have been explicit in terms of what they would do to employ our military power. she would be an extremely proactive president in foreign policy, with a particular animus directed against russia. and, unfortunately, there would be little or no pushback against the exercise of her admittedly poor instincts regarding what to do, as was demonstrated regarding libya and also with benghazi. she would find little opposition in congress and the media for an extremely risky foreign policy, and would benefit from the washington groupthink that prevails over the alleged threats emanating from russia, iran, and china. hillary has received support from foreign policy hawks, including a large number of formerly republican neocons, to include robert kagan, michael chertoff, michael hayden, eliot cohen and eric edelman. james stavridis, a retired admiral who was once vetted by clinton as a possible vice president, recently warned of the need to use deadly force against the iranians. i think its coming. its going to be maritime confrontation and if it doesnt happen immediately, ill bet you a dollar its going to be happening after the presidential election, whoever is elected. hillary believes that syrias president bashar al-assad is the root cause of the turmoil in that country and must be removed as the first priority. it is a foolish policy as al-assad in no way threatens the united states while his enemy isis does and regime change would create a power vacuum that will benefit the latter. she has also called for a no-fly zone in syria to protect the local population as well as the insurgent groups that the us supports, some of which had been labeled as terrorists before they were renamed by current secretary of state john kerry. such a zone would dramatically raise the prospect of armed conflict with russia and it puts washington in an odd position vis-à-vis what is occurring in syria. the us is not at war with the syrian government, which, like it or not, is under international law sovereign within its own recognized borders. damascus has invited the russians in to help against the rebels and objects to any other foreign presence on syrian territory. in spite of all that, washington is asserting some kind of authority to intervene and to confront the russians as both a humanitarian mission and as an inherent right of self-defense. hillary has not recommended doing anything about saudi arabia, qatar and turkey, all of which have at one time or another for various reasons supported isis, but she is clearly no friend of iran, which has been fighting isis. as a senator, she threatened to totally obliterate iran but she has more recently reluctantly supported the recent nuclear agreement with that country negotiated by president barack obama. but she has nevertheless warned that she will monitor the situation closely for possible violations and will otherwise pushback against activity by the islamic republic. as one of her key financial supporters is israeli haim saban, who has said he is a one issue guy and that issue is israel, she is likely to pursue aggressive policies in the persian gulf. she has also promised to move americas relationship with prime minister benjamin netanyahu to a new level and has repeatedly declared that her support for israel is unconditional. one of hillarys advisors, former cia acting director michael morell, has called for new sanctions on tehran and has also recently recommended that the us begin intercepting iranian ships presumed to be carrying arms to the houthis in yemen. washington is not at war with either iran or yemen and the houthis are not on the state department terrorist list but our good friends the saudis have been assiduously bombing them for reasons that seem obscure. stopping ships in international waters without any legal pretext would be considered by many an act of piracy. morell has also called for covertly assassinating iranians and russians to express our displeasure with the foreign policies of their respective governments. hillarys dislike for russias vladimir putin is notorious. syria aside, she has advocated arming ukraine with game changing offensive weapons and also bringing ukraine and georgia into nato, which would force a sharp russian reaction. one suspects that she might be sympathetic to the views expressed recently by carl gershman in a washington post op-ed that received curiously little additional coverage in the media. gershman is the head of the taxpayer funded national endowment for democracy ned, which means that he is a powerful figure in washingtons foreign-policy establishment. ned has plausibly been described as doing the sorts of things that the cia used to do. after making a number of bumper-sticker claims about russia and putin that are either partially true, unproven or even ridiculous, gershman concluded that the united states has the power to contain and defeat this danger. the issue is whether we can summon the will to do so. it is basically a call for the next administration to remove putin from poweras foolish a suggestion as has ever been seen in a leading newspaper, as it implies that the risk of nuclear war is completely acceptable to bring about regime change in a country whose very popular, democratically elected leadership we disapprove of. but it is nevertheless symptomatic of the kind of thinking that goes on inside the beltway and is quite possibly a position that hillary clinton will embrace. she also benefits from having the perfect implementer of such a policy in robert kagans wife victoria nuland, her extremely dangerous protégé who is currently assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and who might wind up as secretary of state in a clinton administration. shifting to east asia, hillary sees the admittedly genuine threat from north korea but her response is focused more on china. she would increase us military presence in the south china sea to deter any further attempts by beijing to develop disputed islands and would also ring china with defensive missiles, ostensibly as protection against pyongyang but also to convince china to pressure north korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. one wonders what beijing might think about being surrounded by made-in-america missiles. trumps foreign policy is admittedly quite sketchy and he has not always been consistent. he has been appropriately enough slammed for being simple minded in saying that he would bomb the crap out of isis, but he has also taken on the republican establishment by specifically condemning the george w. bush invasion of iraq and has more than once indicated that he is not interested in either being the worlds policeman or in new wars in the middle east. he has repeatedly stated that he supports nato but it should not be construed as hostile to russia. he would work with putin to address concerns over syria and eastern europe. he would demand that nato countries spend more for their own defense and also help pay for the maintenance of us bases. trumps controversial call to stop all muslim immigration has been rightly condemned but it contains a kernel of truth in that the current process for vetting new arrivals in this country is far from transparent and apparently not very effective. the obama administration has not been very forthcoming on what might be done to fix the entire immigration process but trump is promising to shake things up, which is overdue, though what exactly a trump administration would try to accomplish is far from clear. continuing on the negative side, trump, who is largely ignorant of the world and its leaders, has relied on a mixed bag of advisors. former head of the defense intelligence agency general michael flynn appears to be the most prominent. flynn is associated with arch neocon michael ledeen and both are rabid about iran, with flynn suggesting that nearly all the unrest in the middle east should be laid at tehrans door. ledeen is, of course, a prominent israel-firster who has long had iran in his sights. the advice of ledeen and flynn may have been instrumental in trumps vehement denunciation of the iran nuclear agreement, which he has called a disgrace, which he has said he would tear up. it is vintage dumb-think. the agreement cannot be canceled because there are five other signatories to it and the denial of a nuclear weapons program to tehran benefits everyone in the region, including israel. it is far better to have the agreement than to scrap it, if that were even possible. trump has said that he would be an even-handed negotiator between israel and the palestinians but he has also declared that he is strongly pro-israel and would move the us embassy to jerusalem, which is a bad idea, not in americas interest, even if netanyahu would like it. it would produce serious blowback from the arab world and would inspire a new wave of terrorism directed against the us regarding the rest of the middle east, trump would prefer strong leaders, i.e. autocrats, who are friendly rather than chaotic reformers. he rejects arming rebels as in syria because we know little about whom we are dealing with and find that we cannot control what develops. he is against foreign aid in principle, particularly to countries like pakistan where the us is strongly disliked. in east asia, trump would encourage japan and south korea to develop their own nuclear arsenals to deter north korea. it is a very bad idea, a proliferation nightmare. like hillary, he would prefer that china intervene in north korea and make kim jong un step down. he would put pressure on china to devalue its currency because it is bilking us of billions of dollars and would also increase us military presence in the region to limit beijings expansion in the south china sea. so there you have it as you enter the voting booth. president obama is going around warning that the fate of the world is teetering over the electoral verdict, which he intends to be a ringing endorsement of hillary even though the choice is not nearly that clear cut. part of the problem with trump is that he has some very bad ideas mixed in with a few good ones and no one knows what he would actually do if he were president. unfortunately, it is all too clear what hillary would do. reprinted with permission from the unz review . related",153,736276,fake

fitzroy is a british and american nationalist who refuses to apologize for the british empire. as a young man, he ""took a president's shilling"" and served in the u.s. army. in his free time, he enjoys studying history and destroying the sjw revisionist narrative. november 12, 2016 politics 
there have been few true upsets in our history caesar crossing the rubicon, wellingtons victories at assaye and waterloo, and washingtons victory at yorktown over the most professional army in the world. it is often said that when general charles ohara who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both george washington and napoleon bonaparte surrendered cornwalliss sword, the band played the world turned upside down. 
today, the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as cornwallis or ohara did at yorktown. and i fully admit in spite of my vote for trump, i fully expected him to lose. the polls, his 60 negative approval rating, and the sheer forces of the media, the fbi and even some republicans were arrayed against him. my skepticism of trump was not his ideas, but his chances of winning the election. myself, and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him, were wrong. 
i am one of the intellectuals who expected a trump defeat. ive been studying politics, history and economics for years, reading countless books on the matter from the prince to freakonomics to the wealth of nations. 
and i was wrong. it was a canadian housewife and an iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for trump. trump beat the odds, he beat the intellectuals, and made the establishment babies in the hands of a giant as was said after napoleons resounding victory at austerlitz in 1806. 
the left is currently in panic-mode in an attempt to explain how they lost. they are calling trump supporters racist, sexists, homophobic and even sex offenders! but in the end, it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating donald trump. trump was immune to almost all conventional political weapons. trump won because of the following 
1. the left seemed far more interested in calling trump and his supporters racist than saying something of substance. 
2. outlets such as the new york times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the nra for the orlando shootings, and even tried to call them terrorists. in this, they beat even trump in outrageousness they thought the american people were stupid, so they just lied to them and said fuck it, those peasants will believe anything we write. 
3. all trump had to do was call them on their bullshit, and call them liars. and he was 100 right the msm has lied to the american people this entire election cycle. subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a muslim, the msm continued to push the narrative that home grown right-wing terrorism is the real problem. trump called them on their lies, and the american people, who are tired of being lied to by the msm, cheered him on, even if he had a few issues with the truth himself. 
4. the democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible. hillary clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled trumps own. and she was bland. and she couldnt decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive. and she is corrupt, and lied about it, stupidly thinking the american people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do. 
5. trump knew how to communicate with people. he knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right like myself. i freely admit i am guilty of this when you study two thousand years of philosophy, economics and rhetoric cicero was particularly effective, it is sometimes frustrating when people dont approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs. the working class that built america go by what they feel in their gut, and often times, they are right. 
all in all, the left failed because they failed to understand america. they bought into the idea that americans are stupidhaha! americans are not stupid they may not be smart, but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the nra is basically the taliban in an obviously biased hit piece. hillary took working class americans for granted, and she lost. this should stand as a parallel for black americans whom the democrats also take for granted. 
i am pleased that donald trump is now president-elect. he wasnt just a candidate, he was the anti-candidate. he did everything a politician should not do. he used vulgar language. he talked freely about his ideas. he made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying america. he turned weaknesses such as his spotty track record into strengths that would have ended any other candidates campaign. he was the un-candidate america needed. 
i have high hopes for trumps presidency. in spite of my tepid support, i see trump as a president who can do a lot of good, and has the potential to do more good than any president of recent memory. 
first, trump spat in the face of pc culture and won. just as scott walker took on the unions in wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election, trump defeated the sjws. if trump can keep this up, we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness, and get back to a concept called actually being correct. 
secondly, trump is an unapologetic nationalist. he loves america, and doesnt give a damn if you think howard zinns a peoples history of the united states is a great book. the department of cultural guilt that has infected schools in america teaches children to hate their own country. i look forward to seeing trump abolish the practice of teaching children that the founding fathers were evil racists, the british empire did nothing good for the world, and that america is the greatest evil the world has ever seen. 
lastly, trump is the antithesis of everything the social justice warriors stand for a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected. i hope to see a rise in masculinity in america studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the american male population. this should rise under trump, as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault. 
i was a trump skeptic. i underestimated him. i didnt disagree with him on much perhaps maybe 20 of his platform, but i had little faith he could pull it off. and i was vocal about my concerns regarding his elect-ability. but like the liberals, i was wrong. and a canadian housewife and a former pickup-artist-turned-conservative-philosopher were 100 right. 
i recall something i told a fellow soldier while on a long, boring convoy operation in iraq when a genius says something, others say wow, that is way above my head. but when a true genius says something, others say wow, why didnt i think of that before?! trump is a true genius he stated the obvious to the american people and made them believe he wanted to make america great again and i think he genuinely does. he didnt use fancy graphs or focus groups he spoke the truth, without political correctness.

as a woman who rejects third-wave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis, i've had my fair share of feminists tell me that i only reject them and their ideas because i suffer from ""internalized misogyny,"" or, in other words, i'm a self-loathing sexist. 
here's exactly how everyday feminism defines ""internalized misogyny,"" if you're unfamiliar with bats crazy 
internalized misogyny, by definition, is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women. 
it becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate, overtly and covertly, that women are less than men  less worthy, less strong, less dependable, less able, less of a leader, less logical  while also more than men more emotional, more irrational, more complex, more to manage. 
of course, this is ridiculous, and i gave such an assertion about as much time as a i would a male feminist hitting on me zero seconds. 
but on wednesday, i learned that team hillary, the political left, likewise thought me a self-loathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for queen pantsuit because i couldn't stomach the thought of a powerful woman, since i apparently believe women are lessers. in fact, ia woman with a chronic case of ""internalized misogynycost hillary the election; not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity, nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag. it was my fault. clinton campaign communications director jess_mc on election loss ""internalized misogyny is a real thing"" inners   all in wchris hayes allinwithchris november 15, 2016

primary investigations point to a limited security breach by vandals likely connected to the regime, which has been attempting to target the medical sector in free syria in order to spread chaos. the statement also added the syrian interim governments health ministry has instructed a halt to the second round of the measles vaccination campaign, which began monday september 15th  following several fatalities and injuries among children in vaccination centers in the idlib countryside. adnan hazouri, the health minister in the syrian opposition who held a conference in the arabic language said that he will resign if an investigation upheld allegations of negligence, as blood samples have been sent to turkey for analysis. the syrian observatory for human rights , which is based in london, also confirmed

"a new email investigation on clinton could hasten the democratic party's demise 20 shares
1 18 0 1
the two-party corporate duopoly remains mired in crisis in the closing days of the 2016 presidential elections. donald trump's virtual hijacking of the republican party has stripped the competition between the two dominant sections of the ruling class down to its most naked form. the corporate media's non-stop coverage of trump was supposed to legitimize the candidacy of hillary clinton and rake in enormous profits for the monopoly outlets. the eyes of the rich have been on hillary clinton to rescue the two-party system from the danger of donald trump. however, thanks to wikileaks, hillary clinton appears poised to take the democratic party down its own path of destruction.
the fbi announcement that it will reopen the investigation of clinton's private email server has significantly eroded the momentum of the democratic party campaign. trump appeared finished by the end of the third presidential debate. his campaign was mired in sexual assault allegations and media inquiries into possible tax evasion. the billionaire white nationalist has suddenly found himself within one point of hillary clinton in recent polls. no matter how many traps trump falls into or how vile his campaign rhetoric, clinton has proven that no amount of trump debauchery can save her from her political record.
unfortunately, the email scandal has been subject to the limitations of corporate media coverage. the threat to ""national security"" has been cited as the number one issue with clinton's breach of state department privacy. indeed, clinton did break the law and from this framework it is no doubt appropriate that she face the consequences. but under imperialism, where billions of people are exploited for the profits of monopoly corporations, the legitimacy of ruling class law is of little worth to the vast majority of humanity. what matters is the content of the emails themselves. the emails reveal that the current conditions of the imperialist system have thrown the two-party system into a permanent crisis of legitimacy.
the first batch of emails dumped by wikileaks exposed how us imperialism serves the masters of war and capital. the initial emails proved that clinton destabilized libya in 2011 in order to stop the gaddafi-led government from instituting an independent gold currency across the african continent . the emails also exposed that the democratic national committee dnc spent copious amounts of time deriding the sanders campaign . another batch of emails further damaged the clinton cache with contents from her speeches to the big banks. it was in these speeches where she told wall street that she takes a different position in public than she does in private. in private, clinton serenaded the ears of the rich with her desires to privatize social security and create a ""hemispheric common market.""
the emails have not been the only development that has soured clinton's election campaign. the obama administration announced in late october that premiums for the affordable care act market-based exchanges are set to increase by 25 percent next year . bill clinton also made negative headlines through a leaked memo that revealed the former president utilized the clinton foundation to make profitable deals with private corporations . in other words, the democratic party has been unable to avoid looking like the corporate servant and imperialist party it always has been. with less than a month left until voting day, a clinton victory is anything but secure.
more... the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship! anointment of hillary clinton exposes a democracy that never was democratic party ignored its 2012 platform there are some in the us who believe that the demise of the democratic party will be a bad thing. clinton has fewer staunch supporters among working people than she does individuals who are willing to hold their nose for clinton in order to avoid a trump presidency. however, the stench emanating from the clinton camp is becoming unbearable. her campaign's reliance on anti-putin russophobia threatens world war. her policy record is equally, if not more deplorable, than donald trump's capitalist, racist, and misogynistic machinations. the new email investigation could be the first nail of many to come in the democratic party coffin.
however, the fear of trump is deeply embedded into the psyche of a large section of american voters. the corporate media has constantly fed many of her lies and suspicions to the masses. one of these myths is the alleged wikileaks-russia-trump alliance. no such alliance exists. neither putin nor wikileaks has announced any sort of allegiance to trump. putin has simply commented on trump's advocacy of a us-russian partnership was a ""smart"" thing to say. furthermore, julian assange has denied publicly that trump would somehow present a better option than hillary clinton. but the truth matters little in a political environment that equates opposition to clinton with support for trump.
clinton has turned the russian blame game toward the fbi. in a campaign speech, clinton insinuated that the fbi is hiding information regarding the putin-trump alliance. her claims were promptly proved false . such remarks may cause more damage to an already unpopular campaign. us intelligence agencies are powerful institutions that current and future presidents must curry the favor of to achieve the objectives of us imperialism. when president john f. kennedy signaled that he wanted to break the cia into a ""thousand pieces,"" he was assassinated shortly thereafter. it was revealed last year that the cia was heavily involved in the cover-up of its involvement in his murder. us intelligence is thus the wrong crowd for a future us president to anger, especially given the vast surveillance apparatus now at its disposal.
speculation aside, the clinton campaign emails present useful information on the depth of us imperialisms crisis. us imperialism has been mired in a period of stagnant economic growth and endless war for decades. it was only a matter of time before this crisis would express itself through its electoral system. never has it been clearer that the two corporate parties in front of us imperial policy work solely for the ruling class. the task now is to utilize the developments of this election cycle in service of the people. that means shedding all fear of what the results of the election will be and basing our action on principles instead.",8,736271,fake

tftp  in a blistering rebuke of the current state of policing in the united states, a report issued by amnesty international usa stated that all 50 u.s. states failed to meet international standards on use of deadly force by law enforcement officers. 
the stunning report lays bare the fact that u.s. police are killing without any formal obligation to respect or preserve human life. 
in an interview with the guardian , amnesty usa executive director steven hawkins said the reports findings revealed a shocking lack of fundamental respect for the sanctity of human life. 
while law enforcement in the united states is given the authority to use lethal force, there is no equal obligation to respect and preserve human life. its shocking that while we give law enforcement this extraordinary power, so many states either have no regulation on their books or nothing that complies with international standards, hawkins said. 
with recent protests in baltimore and ferguson, over police killings, there has been an ever-growing spotlight being shined on the culture of policing. 
amnesty analyzed each of the 50 u.s states statutes regarding use of lethal force. they then compared them against the united nations accepted principles of only using lethal force in order to protect life in unavoidable instances after first attempting to utilize less extreme means. 
un guidelines go on to state that officers should identify themselves and give a clear warning of the intent to use deadly force. 
the report found that none of the 50 states met these international standards for using lethal force, stating 
none of the laws establish the requirement that lethal force may only be used as a last resort with non-violent means and less harmful means to be tried first. the vast majority of laws do not require officers to give a warning of their intent to use firearms. 
the u.s. constitutional standard is less stringent, as set by a 1985 supreme court case tennesse v garner. the court held that an officer may use deadly force to prevent a suspect from escaping if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. 
even so, 13 u.s. states failed to meet that constitutional standard, instead choosing to use extremely vague language in their statutes, which can be manipulated to allow for force use well beyond accepted standards. for example, north dakota allows for deadly force against an individual who has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving violence, without ever defining what level of violence would warrant lethal force. 
nine states have absolutely no statutes on the books regarding officer use of lethal force maryland, massachusetts, michigan, ohio, south carolina, virginia, west virginia, wisconsin and wyoming  as well as washington d.c., meaning that inevitably police investigate themselves based on some arbitrary standard. 
the analysis found that only eight states had a requirement of a verbal warning before engaging in the use of deadly force. and in nine states, police can legally use lethal force during a time of rioting. in pennsylvania, for example, a statute on use of force declares use of lethal force legitimate if necessary to suppress a riot or mutiny after the rioters or mutineers have been ordered to disperse. 
amnestys report states that in following international standards, all fatal incidents should be mandatorily reported and impartially investigated. the u.s. does no such thing, as the fbi runs a completely voluntary database. 
according the guardian 
the report also suggests taking action at all levels of government, making recommendations to the president, congress and the us justice department, along with state legislatures and individual law enforcement departments. amnesty suggests that laws be brought into compliance with international standards at every level, and that the justice department oversee a national commission to examine and produce recommendations on policing issues, including a nationwide review of police use of lethal force laws  as well as a thorough review and reform of oversight and accountability mechanisms. 
hawkins went on to say that he expects pushback from the police and their unions, but stated, with so much attention on law enforcement and its use of lethal force within the us, in the next legislative session this report will produce some energy for change. 
the push for police accountability is now reaching a fever pitch in the u.s., as the current policing paradigm is unsustainable. with so many great ideas for systemic reform on the table, and so many great minds pushing for accountability, it seems only a matter of time before the current good ole boy power structure comes crumbling down.

"breaking! nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least 6 timesmoney laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play,proof of inappropriate handling classified information  100percentfedup.com breaking! nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least 6 timesmoney laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play,proof of inappropriate handling classified information blackwater usa founder, retired navy seal erik prince 
prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week. 
because of weinergate and the sexting scandal, the nypd started investigating it. through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing, prince claimed. 
they found state department emails. they found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein. bill clinton went there more than 20 times. hillary clinton went there at least six times, he said. 
the amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi, and they said, were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments, prince explained. 
i believe  i know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1pp, one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and theyve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the justice department, with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago. thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters, prince said. 
theres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department. so in the, i hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, i believe, 1860, prince declared. 
marlow asked prince to clarify these revelations. 
nypd was the first one to look at that laptop, prince elaborated. weiner and huma abedin, his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for 20 years  have both flipped. they are cooperating with the government. they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server, which contained classified information. weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found. 
so nypd first gets that computer. they see how disgusting it is. they keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the fbi, which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs, making comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. the point being, nypd has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt, prince contended. 
there is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sendingreceiving of classified information, up to sap level special access programs, he stated. 
so the plot thickens. nypd was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue, prince said. 
he noted that the fbi can investigate these matters, but they cant convene a grand jury. they cant file charges. 
the prosecutors, the justice department has to do that, he explained. now, as i understand it, preet bharara, the manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. from what i hear, hes a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing. 
marlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons. 
prince agreed, but said, if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? 
listen to interview here 
the point being, fortunately, its not just the fbi; there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the nypd has it as well, prince said, citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft, back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd, in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed. 
the justice department is trying to run out the clock, to elect hillary clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done, he warned. 
as for the mayor of new york city, prince said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this. 
the evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that i think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling, he said.

much that needed to be renewed has already been shown to you and new ways have begun to be tried. this has been very successful in places; but, as yet, this has not been given much attention. one of the things you may wish to do when success of this nature comes to your attention, is to help spread knowledge of it to the best of your ability. your new world is being constructed by you even as the chaos appears to be on the rise.
we would love to say that the worst is over. the truth, however, is that it is not. the worst is still being hidden from you. and until one sees the truth, nothing will be done to change it. that is what is happening. you need to see what is coming to the surface to be seen. many of you already understand, but again, the understanding does not bring much comfort.
now, we have titled this message tipping point for a reason. it is not because you are at the tipping point. the fact is that you passed that point some time ago. you are, in fact, now past the point of no return; and the old structures, and those who uphold them, are well aware that they are fighting for their very existence. if you look at what is around you in that light, you will see it is so. they see the outcome, and they do not like it. however, giving in to a possible better way of life does not look attractive from their viewpoint. they truly have nothing, but they imagine that they have everything to lose.
it is more than likely that if you are reading this, you are not under the bombs, not getting mace in your face, and not standing in front of civil police that look like shock troops. but all of those things exist in your world, and therefore in your field of being. you feel them. but what can you do? is there anything you can do?
well, many of you are offering support in many ways, not the least of which is your resolve, your prayer, and your intent. and that is exactly what we would advise. the problem is that you do not see the effect of that. we do. we see the changes in the energy of your world very clearly. and we are telling you now that this energy is rising. this is what you came for. this is what you are good at. and this is what you are doing. those of you who do indeed feel the energy of earths field know this. all of you could feel it if you trained yourselves to do so. but regardless of whether or not this appeals to you, we ask you to know that your efforts are working and to find every opportunity to raise the frequency that you can.
one thing we will remind you of once again. it is just as important for you to keep your own energies up as it is to pray or meditate for the troubled spots that you know about. if you are not in your highest frequency, you indeed cannot help much. if you are in your highest state of love and joy, and are doing all you can to reach higher, you are making major contributions to the final outcome. fear and darkness cannot exist in an atmosphere of unconditional love. darkness does not exist in the presence of bright light. as one of your greatest scientists once said, this is not philosophy, it is physics. dearest family, it is also alchemy. it is what changes lead into gold. buddhists call it poison into medicine.

"hillary clinton enjoys solid lead in early voting reutersipsos poll by reuters   551 pm democratic nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the reutersipsos states of the nation project.   
by maurice tamman 
new york reuters  with 11 days to go before the u.s. presidential election, democratic nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the reutersipsos states of the nation project. 
though data is not available for all early voting states, clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as ohio and arizona and in republican party strongholds such as georgia and texas. 
an estimated 19 million americans have voted so far in the election, according to the university of floridas united states election project, accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate. 
overall, clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the electoral college, the reutersipsos survey showed. 
having so many ballots locked down before the nov. 8 election is good news for the clinton campaign. on friday, the federal bureau of investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to clintons close aide, huma abedin. those emails were found on a computer belonging to anthony weiner, abedins estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. the reutersipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged friday afternoon. 
it remains unclear whether the fbi inquiry will upset the balance in the race. the bureau disclosed nothing about the abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to clinton. over the summer, the fbi said it was closing its investigation into clintons use of a private email system while secretary of state. until friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial fbi email probe. 
clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. trump has said none of the accusations are true. he also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes. 
as of thursday, clintons odds of receiving the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to state of the nation polling results released saturday. the project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the democrat. 
clintons lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by president barack obama over republican mitt romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a reutersipsos poll taken at the time. obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to romneys 206. 
but even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for clinton. news coverage of trumps accusers had diminished, while clinton confronted the almost daily release by wikileaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign managers account. this weeks leaked messages raised questions about former president bill clintons finances. 
and her lead in the states of the nation project fell slightly from last week. though the projected electoral college votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. trump didnt see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains the swing states of pennsylvania, colorado, iowa and nevada all moved from leaning to clinton to being too close to call. 
still, trumps path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning ohio, north carolina and florida. as of thursday, ohio remained a toss-up. florida and north carolina were still tilting toward clinton, according to the states of the nation results.

"comment on 6 steps to becoming the best leader possible by 6 steps to becoming the best leader possible  motivate3.com share on facebook share on twitter what does it mean to be a leader? this is a question i have been asking myself repeatedly over the past few weeks. the 2016 presidential election is but a few weeks away and i am left feeling confused, disgusted, and outright angry at what has been demonstrated as leadership. if i am honest, i feel embarrassed to be a citizen of a country that is most certainly causing many eyes to roll and jokes to be made.   we are better than this. as i continue to grow, fall down, pick myself back up, and evolve as a leader, i am constantly exploring what the word means to me and how i can embody that meaning from a grounded and heart-centered place. i come back time and time again to the same process  a process that is not weighted or influenced by that which is outside of me, but rather by that which lives deep inside of me. its about self-inquiry, self-reflection, self-accountability, and self-responsibility. its a process that asks me to drop to my knees, to stretch, to get uncomfortable, to ask more of myself. its a process that in times like these, we uncompromisingly appoint ourselves to undergo because we have no choice but to stand firmly in our own leadership. whether you are a butcher, baker, or a candlestick maker  you are a leader. and the world needs as many honest, honourable, and integrity-filled leaders as it can get right now. here are my six strategies for stepping firmly into your own embodied leadership. i invite you to get comfy with a notebook, pen, and cup of warm tea and walk yourself through this process step-by-step. 1. identify your value system what matters most to you? where do you feel unwilling to compromise? your integrity? loyalty? ambition? transparency? your values are the foundational parts of yourself that guide your behaviours, choices, and actions. when these are in alignment and you are living your values, you feel at peace inside of yourself. you are operating not from your head or your gut, but from your heart. you are discerning in your decisions and steadfast in your commitments. not only does it feel good inside of yourself, it is overwhelmingly obvious to the outside world that youve got something groovy going on.   2. acknowledge and understand what makes you, you i hope this step doesnt scare you, because this one takes a little bit of work, as it is an ongoing unfolding process. although many of us know parts of ourselves, we also have blind spots. part of stepping into your leadership is to see and understand all of yourself the good, the bad, and the ugly. for me, the most helpful resource i have found is the enneagram . this highly evolved personality typing system helps you to better understand your strengths, your stressors, your fears, your areas for growth, and your opportunities to develop. using this system, you can become clearer on who you are, while learning how other people operate in the world. this information can be unbelievably helpful when learning how to be mindful and aware as a leader. as an enneagram type 2, the healer, i am well-versed in knowing that my superpower is my ability to be compassionate, empathetic, and helpful, but i also lose my power and can become insecure when i do not feel needed. this does not make me weak or invaluable as a leader, but rather pushes me to rise up and push my edges whenever i experience this feeling so that i can meet my own boundless potential. 3. cultivate a network of mentors want to know something crazy? you dont know everything and you cant do it all on your own. i know how disappointing this may sound, but let me tell you something its a damn godsend! not needing to know it all or have all of the answers gives you space to be vulnerable, approachable, real, and ever-changing. a network of mentors helps you to not feel alone when you are up against the wall and arent quite sure how to navigate your next steps. over the past few years i have worked hard to create my network of mentors. currently, my network consists of one spiritual mentor and two professional mentors. oh, and i also have a therapist. thats right, i have four older, wiser, more evolved humans in my life that i can regularly call upon when in need. and they arent my friends. i dont call them to gab, or simply catch up. i call them when i need to get in deep and unpack some serious personal, professional, or spiritual shit. this wolf pack is a group of individuals who have been around the sun once or twice and take their role as a mentor seriously. if you are feeling lost or misguided in your leadership, i greatly encourage you to reach out to people who inspire you and are living and leading lives that you admire. dont be shy. dont hold back. be willing to pay a bit of money for it. be willing to be rejected. but most of all, be willing to ask. 4. act from authenticity a few months back i wrote an article about my 5 tips on being genuine . it almost makes me laugh to think that we need to be reminded to be authentic in our actions. however, the truth is that we have become used to cropping our lives into a series of photographs, 140 characters, or neat blog entries and facebook posts. we have become buttoned up, edited, and the image of perfection. so, let me show you my leadership by revealing some of my imperfections. i often have no idea what im doing. i felt sad for almost all of last week and i couldnt totally put my finger on why or what to do other than get lots of sleep, exercise, and eat well. i have lots of little blonde hairs on my upper lip that i pluck when i remember. sometimes i watch tv on my computer in bed. other times i eat peanut butter toast and scrambled eggs for dinner when i feel too wiped out to cook. ive been called bossy. my boyfriend and i fight. i can get anxious when work is slow. your inbox will never be the same inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. writing these words, i can feel my own power grow. im not hiding anything. im not putting on a face or trying to be put together; im just being human. and whenever i read or watch someone else show me their messiness, i feel their power and their leadership. being human is sexy. show the world what youre working with. 5. constantly work on your communication skills let me repeat this one constantly work on your communication skills. communication is a basic life skill and your ability to communicate largely determines your happiness. when you communicate effectively, you make and keep friends. you are valued at work. your family respects and trusts you. your needs get met. when you communicate effectively, people listen and hear you, and you learn how to listen to and hear other people. this is when magic happens. strong, compassionate communication is something that is learned; youre not born with it. if you are looking for resources on how to better communicate, i highly recommend the books messages the communication skills book by matthew mckay, martha davis, and patrick fanning and nonviolent communication a language of life by marshall b. rosenberg. additionally, be open to uncovering the underlying reasons of why you react or feel triggered another blog post coming soon on that by certain types of communication as well as receiving feedback from others on ways that you communicate well and areas for growth. 6. commit yourself to lifelong learning whether you are a ceo at a company, a full-time parent, a caretaker, just starting out your career, or saving the world, you are a leader. and any truly great leader is always learning. leaders are strengthening their strengths, finding opportunity in their obstacles, and discovering new ways to be the best versions of themselves. whether it is a book, workshop, therapy session, class, or travel experience, commit yourself to a lifelong learning process and you will forever feel empowered in your leadership. we are currently witnessing a national crisis, where the proposed future leaders of our country are being caught in webs of lies, immoral behaviours, cruel words, disrespectful communication, and dishonourable action. i know its easy to sit here, pointing fingers and placing blame. instead, i am asking you to rise up and embrace your own, unique, and powerful leadership so that we can all come together, one by one, and stand up for what we believe in. truth. peace. integrity. compassion. equality. loyalty. honesty. and love. if you are doing it right, you will feel like you are revealing too much.

"koch brothers helped incite the impending bloodbath among republicans by rmuse   757 pm ""if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half, i think its going to be just catastrophic.""   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a full-on civil war, and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the inter-party discord is its standard bearer donald j. trump. however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion-minded trump supporters, the real instigators are the koch brothers. 
although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon, they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed, the workings of government itself. the tea party caucus, an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a. boehner out of congress, morphed into the inaptly- named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job, although that is high on the trump supporters to-do list. 
as noted in wednesdays new york times,  mr. trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the anti-establishment energy that mr. trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down . 
the right-wing extremist that actually  took down  former house majority leader eric cantor, conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat, issued a warning to establishment republicans 
 theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to d.c. leadership comes and smacks our guy? thats where youre going to put down a marker? really? and the american people are just scratching their head saying, really? thats rich . 
brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton. 
donald trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump. in fact, besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump, it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy. and, during an interview with reuters he complained that  the people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top . win or lose, there is going to be a major blood-letting after the election and the establishment, although powerful, may face a herculean task to save the party. 
this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti-establishment devotee to run his campaign. the chairman of breitbart news, stephen bannon, had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber-conservative paradise. and uber-conservative is just a different way of saying a  non-government  according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism. dont believe it? 
two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers, heritage action for america and freedomworks , have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions; something establishment types are resisting. 
over the past few days, leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next, or new, speaker of the house; something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome. 
according to the chief executive of heritage action, michael needham, there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump. mr. needham said, 
 if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half, i think its going to be just catastrophe . 
another conservative extremist, house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said,  you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle.  
the dilemma for republicans after the election, no matter the outcome, is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party. that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses, big or small, the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump. if trump wins, the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november 8, it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans. 
the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger. after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative, and the past year-and-a-half of incitement by donald trump, the republican party faces a serious threat to its long-term survival. it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party.",133,736267,real

since march of 2010, the american people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the affordable care actobamacare. this legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the house and senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan president in american history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that dont work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. as it appears obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the democrats and president obama, and abetted by the supreme court, will be difficult to repair unless the next president and a republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
congress must act. our elected representatives in the house and senate must 
1. completely repeal obamacare. our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. no person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. as long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. by allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldnt congress allow individuals the same exemptions? as we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. we must review basic options for medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. trending on 100 fed up",0,736269,real
"the modern history of rigged us elections posted on october 27, 2016 by washingtonsblog 
by robert parry, the investigative reporter who many of the iran-contra stories for the associated press and newsweek in the 1980s. originally published at parrys consortium news republished with permission. 
the united states is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worlds gold standard that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a u.s. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. the wise men of the system simply insist otherwise. 
we have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering as in election 1960 or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent as in elections 1968 and 1980 or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges as in election 2000. presidents richard nixon, george h.w. bush and ronald reagan photographed together in the oval office in 1991. cropped from a white house photo that also included presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter. 
strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. protecting the perceived integrity of the u.s. democratic process is paramount. americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
the harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. 
of course, historically, american democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including african-american slaves and women. the compromises needed to enact the constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation although obviously slaves couldnt vote. 
that unsavory deal enabled thomas jefferson to defeat john adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. in effect, the votes of southern slave owners like jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of northern non-slave owners. 
even after the civil war when the constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the south, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. whites in former confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
indeed, the alleged voter fraud in election 1960, concentrated largely in texas, a former confederate state and home to john kennedys vice presidential running mate, lyndon johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the souths heritage of rigging elections in favor of democrats, the post-civil war party of white southerners. 
however, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, kennedy and johnson earned the enmity of many white southerners who switched their allegiance to the republican party via richard nixons southern strategy of coded racial messaging. nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. 
nixons treason 
so, by 1968, the democrats once solid south was splintering, but nixon, who was again the republican presidential nominee, didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. nixon feared that  with the vietnam war raging and the democratic party deeply divided  president johnson could give the democratic nominee, vice president hubert humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with north vietnam. president richard nixon with his then-national security advisor henry kissinger in 1972. 
the documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, nixons campaign went behind johnsons back to persuade south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu to torpedo johnsons paris peace talks by refusing to attend. nixons emissaries assured thieu that a president nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for south vietnam. 
though johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called nixons treason  from fbi wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election  he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. in a nov. 4, 1968 conference call , secretary of state dean rusk, national security advisor walt rostow and defense secretary clark clifford  three pillars of the establishment  expressed that consensus, with clifford explaining the thinking 
some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that im wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual nixon elected, clifford said. it could cast his whole administration under such doubt that i think it would be inimical to our countrys interests. 
cliffords words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of americas electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. the american people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process. 
to this day, the major u.s. news media will not directly address the issue of nixons treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the johnson presidential library in austin, texas. in a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the librarys archivists call the file on nixons sabotage of the vietnam peace talks their x-file. for details, see consortiumnews.coms  lbjs x-file on nixons treason.  
the evidence also strongly suggests that nixons paranoia about a missing white house file detailing his treason  top secret documents that johnson had entrusted to rostow at the end of lbjs presidency  led to nixons creation of the plumbers, a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. the existence of the plumbers became public in june 1972 when they were caught breaking into the democratic national committees headquarters at the watergate in washington. national security adviser walt rostow shows president lyndon johnson a model of a battle near khe sanh in vietnam. u.s. archive photo 
although the watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major u.s. news media never acknowledge the link between watergate and nixons far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking johnsons vietnam peace talks while 500,000 american soldiers were in the war zone. in part because of nixons sabotage  and his promise to thieu of a more favorable outcome  the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to johnson in 1968. see consortiumnews.coms  the heinous crime behind watergate . 
in effect, watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by nixons strange personality. however, even though nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his national security advisor henry kissinger, who also had a hand in the paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting presidents foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign. 
reagans october surprise caper 
in that case, president jimmy carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 american hostages then held in revolutionary iran. ronald reagans campaign feared that carter might pull off an october surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election. so, this historical mystery has been did reagans team take action to block carters october surprise? president ronald reagan, delivering his inaugural address on jan. 20, 1981, as the 52 u.s. hostages in iran are simultaneously released. 
the testimonial and documentary evidence that reagans team did engage in a secret operation to prevent carters october surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding nixons paris peace talk maneuver. 
that evidence indicates that reagans campaign director william casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages release before election day, after apparently consulting with nixon and kissinger and aided by former cia director george h.w. bush, who was reagans vice presidential running mate. 
by early november 1980, the publics obsession with irans humiliation of the united states and carters inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a reagan landslide. when the hostages were finally let go immediately after reagans inauguration on jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the iranians had finally relented out of fear of reagan. 
bolstered by his image as a tough guy, reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the great american middle class. 
behind the scenes, the reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to iran, mostly through israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for irans cooperation in getting reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration. then-vice president george h.w. bush with cia director william casey at the white house on feb. 11, 1981. photo credit reagan library 
in summer 1981, when assistant secretary of state for the middle east nicholas veliotes learned about the arms shipments to iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a pbs interview 
it was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the israelis could transship to iran some american-origin military equipment.  this operation seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the reagan administration. and i understand some contacts were made at that time. 
those early covert arms shipments to iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the iran-contra affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to reagans beloved nicaraguan contra rebels fighting to overthrow nicaraguas leftist government. 
while many facts of the iran-contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the reagan-iran relationship was always kept hazy. the republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the democrats were almost as reluctant to go there. 
a half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-president george h.w. bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. in other words, bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt. 
tired of the story 
by the early 1990s, the mainstream u.s. news media was also tired of the complex iran-contra scandal and wanted to move on. as a correspondent at newsweek, i had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before i left the magazine in 1990. i then received an assignment from pbs frontline to look into the 1980 october surprise question, which led to a documentary on the subject in april 1991. pbs frontlines the election held hostage, co-written by robert parry and robert ross. 
however, by fall 1991, just as congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at newsweek, along with the new republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting israels exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. they published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 october surprise case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording caseys attendance at a conference in london in july 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to madrid to meet with senior iranians regarding the hostages. 
although the bogus newsweeknew republic london alibi would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. with bush angrily denying everything and the congressional republicans determined to protect the presidents flanks, the democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation. 
meanwhile, bushs state department and white house counsels office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena. 
years later, i discovered a document at the bush presidential library in college station, texas, confirming that casey had taken a mysterious trip to madrid in 1980. the u.s. embassys confirmation of caseys trip was passed along by state department legal adviser edwin d. williamson to associate white house counsel chester paul beach jr. in early november 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape. 
williamson said that among the state department material potentially relevant to the october surprise allegations was a cable from the madrid embassy indicating that bill casey was in town, for purposes unknown, beach noted in a  memorandum for record  dated nov. 4, 1991. 
two days later, on nov. 6, beachs boss, white house counsel c. boyden gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the october surprise case. the explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt president bushs reelection hopes in 1992. c. boyden gray, white house counsel under president george h.w. bush. 
at the meeting, gray laid out how to thwart the october surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the iran-contra investigation. the prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to george h.w. bushs reelection campaign. as assistant white house counsel ronald vonlembke, put it , the white house goal in 1991 was to killspike this story. 
gray explained the stakes at the white house strategy session. whatever form they ultimately take, the house and senate october surprise investigations, like iran-contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the president , gray declared, according to minutes . emphasis in original. 
among touchstones cited by gray were no surprises to the white house, and maintain ability to respond to leaks in real time. this is partisan. white house talking points on the october surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings. 
timid democrats 
but bushs white house really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in december 1992 and january 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 reagan campaign had conspired with iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 americans in order to ensure reagans election victory. former rep. lee hamilton, d-indiana. 
that would have undermined the faith of the american people in their democratic process  and that, as clark clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be good for the country. 
in 2014 when i sent a copy of beachs memo regarding caseys trip to madrid to former rep. lee hamilton, d-indiana, who had chaired the october surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forces dismissive conclusions about the october surprise issue. 
the bush-41 white house did not notify us that he casey did make the trip to madrid, hamilton told me. should they have passed that on to us? they should have because they knew we were interested in that. 
asked if knowledge that casey had traveled to madrid might have changed the task forces dismissive october surprise conclusion, hamilton said yes, because the question of the madrid trip was key to the task forces investigation. 
if the white house knew that casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us, hamilton said, adding that you have to rely on people in authority to comply with information requests. but that trust was at the heart of the inquirys failure. with the money and power of the american presidency at stake, the idea that george h.w. bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was naïve in the extreme. 
arguably, hamiltons timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave bushs team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. then, hamiltons investigative conclusion reinforced the group think dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a conspiracy theory when it was anything but. in the years since, hamilton hasnt done anything to change the public impression that the reagan campaign was innocent. 
still, among the few people who have followed this case, the october surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key republicans didnt make any sense . 
but the dismissive group think remains undisturbed as far as the major u.s. media and mainstream historians are concerned. for details, see robert parrys americas stolen narrative or trick or treason the 1980 october surprise mystery or consortiumnews.coms  second thoughts on october surprise.  
past as prologue 
lee hamiltons decision to clear reagan and bush of the 1980 october surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. the findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about george h.w. bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, george w. bush, in 2000. president george w. bush is introduced by his brother florida gov. jeb bush before delivering remarks at sun city center, florida, on may 9, 2006. white house photo by eric draper 
indeed, if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the october surprise and iran-contra cases, its hard to imagine that his son would have received the republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the white house. and, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of democrats to resist another bush stolen election in 2000. 
regarding election 2000, the evidence is now clear that vice president al gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under florida law than did george w. bush. but bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, gov. jeb bush, and then on five republican justices on the u.s. supreme court to thwart a full recount and to award him floridas electoral votes and thus the presidency. 
the reality of gores rightful victory should have finally become clear in november 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of floridas disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under florida law were counted. 
however, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 911 attacks had occurred, so the new york times, the washington post, cnn and other leading outlets did not want the american people to know that the wrong person was in the white house. surely, telling the american people that fact amid the 911 crisis would not be good for the country. 
so, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery  that the so-called over-votes in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices names broke heavily for gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the under-votes that hadnt registered on antiquated voting machines. over-votes would be counted under florida law which bases its standards on clear intent of the voter. 
however, instead of leading with gores rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given florida narrowly to bush. they either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred. former vice president al gore. photo credit algore.com 
on nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, i examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of gores victory. in a story that day, i suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. they had hid the reality for the good of the country, much as johnsons team had done in 1968 regarding nixons sabotage of the paris peace talks and hamiltons inquiry had done regarding the 1980 october surprise case. 
within a couple of hours of my posting the article at consortiumnews.com, i received an irate phone call from the new york times media writer felicity barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-times executive editor howell raines. i got the impression that barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didnt accept the bush-won conventional wisdom. 
however, this violation of objective and professional journalism  bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle  was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. it was about the future. 
by misleading americans into thinking that bush was the rightful winner of election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 911 attacks  the major news outlets gave bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of iraq under false pretenses. the bush-won headlines of november 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. for the details of how a full florida recount would have given gore the white house, see consortiumnews.coms  gores victory ,  so bush did steal the white house , and  bush v. gores dark american decade.  
a phalanx of misguided consensus 
looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element after the stolen elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the american people that nothing improper has happened. graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twisted. u.s. supreme court justice antonin scalia. 
al gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by republican partisans on the supreme court, who stopped the counting of ballots in florida on the grounds, as justice antonin scalia said, that a count that showed gore winning when the courts majority was already planning to award the white house to bush would undermine bushs legitimacy. 
similarly, rep. hamilton is regarded as a modern wise man, in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didnt ruffle too many feathers. 
but the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies  uttered for the good of the country  is to corrode the faith of many well-informed americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. it is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest. 
so, when donald trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many americans choose to believe his demagogy. but trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. he actually praises republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint supreme court justices in the mold of the late antonin scalia. republican presidential nominee donald trump. 
trumps complaints about rigged elections are more in line with the white southerners during jim crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they dont succeed at stealing the election from white people. 
there is a racist undertone to trumps version of a rigged democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. hes just not honest about what those flaws are. 
the hard truth is that the u.s. political process is not democracys gold standard; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.",230,736264,fake
"poll sexism was not a factor in hillary's loss  daily wire poll sexism was not a factor in hillary's loss by aaron bandler november 11, 2016 
some leftists still reeling from hillary clinton's stunning defeat on tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president. however, a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in clinton's loss. 
the poll, conducted by conquest communications group and published on just facts , featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism ""if you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate, who would you vote for?"" 
here were the results emphasis added 
overall, 69 of voters said it does not matter, 15 preferred a female, 12 preferred a male, 3 were unsure, and 1 refused to answer. 
male voters and trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say it does not matter, at 73 and 72 respectively. the other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error, with rates of 67 for clinton voters. 66 for undecided voters. 64 for females. 
naturally, supporters of trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president25 percent to 2 percent, respectivelyand clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president, 27 percent to 5 percent, respectively. 
the survey was conducted from october 11-23, so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election. but it's hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists. 
there is a little bias towards a male president among trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among clinton voters, but the results of the survey suggest that overall, the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the united states. 
democrats will have to find a different strategy for identity politics since the gender card doesn't work. speaking of identity politics, it looks like the race card seems to be in trouble as well . tags",43,736279,real
"youtube bans 'clinton's black son' print side-by-side of bill clinton and danney williams 
new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams, the 30-year-old who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former president bill clinton. 
youtube, citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines, declared the account cannot be restored. 
the youtube decision blocked the nine-minute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams, which had received 1.2 million views since williams posted it last week. produced by filmmaker joel gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity. 
like the reporting you see here? sign up for free news alerts from wnd.com, americas independent news network. 
my youtube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on youtube alone, williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision. youtube cant handle the truth! please share billclintonson. 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page , but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated. sorry about that. 
the video is still running on danney williams-clintons facebook page , as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert. 
attempt to silence danney williams? 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous! there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines, gilbert said. 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension. 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney, to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in 1990, gilbert said. 
danney cannot be silenced any longer, he continued. hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug, but its not going to work this time. his story is out there, and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin. 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president. 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet. 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced. 
clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father, citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time, there was no match, nothing even close. 
but in an interview, bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna, bunton told wnd. 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw, new york. 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr, extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress. 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the new york times, wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back, bunton recalled to wnd. we thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write. 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi. 
twitter rules 
many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including james okeefe and his project veritas, which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct. 13, twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of twitter rules. the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users private information or violating other rules. in a statement, okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public. on monday, okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube, calling the apparent block bizarre. earlier this month, okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the daily caller reported . project veritas posted an undercover video oct. 17 proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube, which google owns, noted silenceisconsent.net . it did, however, trend on twitter, which google does not own. breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention. for some 11 months, the makers of the new movie im not ashamed, about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through youtube. the trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movies entire channel was suspended . 
among the conservatives censored by facebook  conservative activist and trump supporter lauren southern received a 30-day ban from facebook because she complained about a friends account being censored. facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schoolers account for posting a video supporting rudy giulianis comment that obama doesnt love america. the admin of a pro-trump group was banned for saying trump is not anti-muslim, but anti-isis.",238,736264,real

to pancho, im researching this material at about the same time you are and also have questions about the products talked about here that surround us every day that we had no idea came about this evil way. the information is devastating to our hearts. 
just want you to know that man looks at the outer appearances but god looks at the heart. 1 samuel 167 so he sees your grief producing a repentant heart that will lead you turn away from sin and instead go the opposite way in your life. the bible says it this way, godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. in other words, worldly grief doesnt change us, but godly grief does. further, scripture says, if we confess our sins, god is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 john 19 i dont know your situation, but i wonder if you have you personally accepted the lord. we personally need to receive gods gracious gift of salvation knowing that christ died in our place for our sins. the bible says if you confess with your mouth that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead, you will be saved. for with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. for the scripture says everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame. and a few verses later it says, for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved. romans 109-11, 13 
the bible tells us that it is not by our works that we are saved but by grace through faith. its not what we do, but what god has done through his son. in ephesians 2, paul says, 4 but god, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with christ  by grace you have been saved  6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in christ jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus. 8 for by grace you have been saved through faith. and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of god, 9 not of works, so that no one may boast. and heres one more passage from titus 3 4 but when the goodness and loving kindness of god our savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the holy spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us richly through jesus christ our savior, 7 so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

"watch trump gropes, humiliates miss universe just to get revenge watch trump gropes, humiliates miss universe just to get revenge by karen shiebler   
it is absolutely incredible that republican presidential candidate donald trump is still trying to deny his sexual misconduct. 
first the man brags about grabbing women and kissing them without consent, then he acts completely outraged that anyone would ever accuse him of doing just that. as a literal parade of women have come forward, one after another, to accuse the candidate of grabbing them, he has responded by threatening to sue them. 
it is hard to believe that anyone would believe trumps shallow denials, but if there is anyone out there who still needs convincing, here you go . 
a video has surfaced from 2011 showing donald j. trump publicly humiliating a beauty pageant contestant with sexual jokes at her expense and an unwanted grope in front of thousands of corporate audience members. 
not only did trump embarrass the woman and grab her in public, he did it out of a very twisted desire for revenge. 
the need for revenge moves trumps misogyny out of the realm of the creepy and into the realm of the truly sick. 
heres what happened, according to reports . 
trump was speaking to a corporate audience in sydney, australia in 2011. as he often does in his corporate speeches, trump talked about getting revenge on those who have slighted him. he said get even with people. if they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. i really believe that. 
what a prince. 
he went on to give the crowd an example of how he gets even. he decided to single out a woman named jennifer hawkins. she was the 2004 winner of the miss universe pageant, which trump owned. he had asked the beauty queen, who is australian, to introduce him at the corporate event, but there had been some type of miscommunication. 
either that, or she had simply declined to do so. 
either way, trump was furious at ms. hawkins. he wanted the crowd to see how he handled his anger at a perceived snub. as he talked about getting revenge, he said  ill give you an example jennifer hawkins. wheres jennifer? wheres she sitting? get over here, jennifer. first of all, how beautiful is jennifer? this is about getting even. trump pulled hawkins up on the stage, telling the crowd how angry he had been at her. when she tried to explain herself, trump pulled the mic away from her and told the crowd how she had dissed him after he had made her a big star through his pageant. he disregarded her attempts to explain, instead choosing to make a sexual joke of her. so what happens is  and you know what? she came tonight, she came  came, she came, she came. when the audience dutifully laughed at ms. hawkins expense, trump added see, so they have the same filthy minds in australia. oh, ha,ha. what a sick adolescent mind. what an ass. it got worse, though. trump grabbed the embarrassed woman and pulled her in for a clearly unwanted kiss. she managed to get an arm in between them, but trump still managed to kiss her cheek. this is all on video, folks. this is right there for everyone to see. the disgusting sexual pervert who wants to be our next president cant dismiss this one with a threat to sue. he cant pretend that it didnt happen. because we can all watch it. right here .

"remember when the media sold us the iraq wmd lies? its happening again pin 12 
 antimedia  months before president george w. bushs speech on september 11, 2002, the new york times reported at the time, white house officials confirmed the bush administration had already been  planning its iraq strategy long before president bushs vacation in texas  in august of that same year. 
the strategy was to persuade the public and congress that the united states and its allies should confront the threat from saddam hussein . 
the now infamous 911 anniversary speech  and the speech before the united nations following the anniversary remarks  both stressed the importance of  ridding the world of terror.  but before speaking to the united nations, bush made the clearest case for war. 
claiming  our principles and our security are challenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and have no limit to their violent ambitions , bush presented his case against iraq, claiming hussein had only  contempt for the united nations  claiming it had no biological weapons.  
making the case that iraq had a clandestine  weapons program  producing tens of thousands of litres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for use with scud warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft spray tanks , bush and his administration sold the invasion of iraq with lies . how the bush administration and the media sold the iraq war 
in 2003, bushs secretary of state, colin powell, laid out bushs rationale for war in iraq, saying iraq had been given several chances to comply with u.n. resolutions regarding the countrys possession of weapons of mass destruction. 
he added that america had proof the hussein regime had evacuated  not destroyed  its weapons, adding that the u.s. government had  satellite photos that indicated that banned materials had recently been moved from a number of iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities.  but what the media then failed to dig into was how the evidence presented by powell had been introduced in a way that helped the administration make the case for war, even as powell himself knew  or at least seemed to know  that there was a possibility they were putting  half a million troops in iraq and marching from one end of the country to the other to find nothing . 
on the day powell delivered his speech, then-cia operations officer valerie plame wilson noticed his claims  simply did not match the intelligence which she had worked on daily for months . sign up for the free anti-media newsletter the establishment doesn't want you to receive 
making use of claims made by a discredited iraqi defector code-named curveball, powell ignored the fact the cia had deemed the source a fabricator and used the sources shaky evidence to convince the media, as well as other global powers, they should all go along with the u.s. plan. 
at the time, the new york times , which had previously openly reported that the bush administration had been planning on selling the iraq war using the best marketing strategies at hand, published a number of opinion pieces reinforcing the idea that iraq had weapons of mass destruction. after reports proved bushs rationale for war had been debunked, the prestigious publication had to retract . 
the late michael ratner, an attorney who served as the president emeritus of the center for constitutional rights in new york, once accused the liberal media, along with the government, of selling the iraq war not by simply claiming hussein had wmds, but also  by claiming that there was a relationship between saddam hussein, who led iraq at the time, and al-qaeda . 
by referring to al-qaeda repeatedly during his u.n. speech , powell spoke to peoples fears. that was a logical strategy considering the country had been healing from the 911 terror attacks. but the media failed to question this link, which had been established via a source who had been tortured . 
ibn al-sheikh al-libi was a high-value cia detainee who  provided bogus information  as he was waterboarded. as ratner pointed out , anyone  would have said anything to stop being waterboarded . 
then-vice president dick cheney and other members of the bush administration had pressured the cia to find a way to connect iraq and al-qaeda, an effort that ultimately helped boost the case for war before the international community. 
what the white house wanted finally materialized when officials tortured al-libi. 
the man who was waterboarded into providing phony info on the al-qaeda link to iraq later died in a libyan prison of an apparent suicide. like iraq, the media now sells the political class lies on russia, syria 
when bush was trying to sell the iraq war to congress, hillary clinton, then a new york senator, voted in favor of authorizing his administration to go into iraq, basing her decision  as much on advice from her husbands advisers as from bush administration officials . 
while she now claims her vote was a mistake, she proved herself to be consistently pro-intervention as secretary of state under president barack obama and as a presidential candidate, having gone so far as to suggest that going against russia in syria by enacting a no-fly zone could  save lives and hasten the end of the conflict . privately, however, she gave a speech to goldman sachs in which she acknowledged establishing a no-fly zone is syria would kill a lot of syrian civilians. 
ever since the arab spring, the obama administration has beat the war drums against russia by pushing for more u.s. presence in syria via official and unofficial means . now, his choice for president is pushing the story that russia  a.k.a. syrias partner in its war against islamist rebels and isis terrorists  is illegally attempting to exert influence over the u.s. election  and the media embraces the move, publishing story after story claiming officials know the kremlin was behind the cyber attacks against the democratic national committee and the election systems in arizona and illinois. without evidence, however, these reports are toothless but still influential enough to make many americans believe russia is, indeed, a threat . 
while russias role in syria isnt as humanitarian as its officials would like us to believe, its proximity to syria plays an important role in its own affairs, making its involvement in the conflict more logical than americas. 
like al-qaeda, isis fighters have repeatedly used u.s. intervention in the middle east to recruit more fighters . and like what happened prior to the iraq war, the u.s. government  and the fourth estate  are working tirelessly to sell the public on yet another unjustified war. 
luckily, americans arent as gullible in 2016 as they were in 2003, as many now keep up with the news by seeking more independent channels. 
but will the next administration bother to ask us our opinion before launching into another war?

"paintings 'almost no one else seemed to be doing' print 
when judith gait met father x, it was a lopsided grief that drew them together. he had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. gait is a married mother of five, and long-term american resident in britain. her support of the pro-life movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her christian faith. 
witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead, gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. subtle and working entirely with symbolism, these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. rather, they mourn in color, symbol and tone with single shoes, broken cord, dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait, commentary by father x 
when a friend first visited gaits studio, he was struck by her abortion paintings. confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child, he wrote i realize your work comes from a place of great love, for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture. 
gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child. it happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby, five years to the day. father x remembers every detail. 
their conversation grew into a joint effort, culminating in a book,  troubadours sailing hibiscus seas meditations on post abortion trauma . father x wanted to remain anonymous, as a place-setter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. he wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of gaits 30 paintings in this book, which have also been shown together in art exhibits. 
time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion, gait claims. rather, the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence, guilt and remorse has not abated. you can see that in the words of father x, which run the gamut of human emotions. on abortion shoe, pot and crossesfrom troubadours sailing hibiscus seas 
jonah of nineveh features an upended, single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. flowers are already in the birth position, head down and waiting to be born. torn and shroud-like ribbons hang across the painting. spirals represent a childs dna helix and the veil of the temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation. father x makes an analogy between jonah fleeing parental responsibility and eventual redemption  then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness it was her wedding dress, my sea green empress, this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. she was full of fear.  
in some of these works, hammers incongruently hang with flowers. they are bloody or blackened, some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. father x interprets these tools as decision markers, to either build or tear down. in hammer of decision, it belongs to thor, the war god infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction. wagner, the olympics, sperm races, thomas moore and valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. either the carpenters hammer of wisdom or thors tool of chaos will be chosen by expectant parents. hammer, suspended 
 troubadours  runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion, the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. this includes moonlighting for angels, celestial games, interstellar wind-jammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas, among other delightful prospects. lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their limbos. 
father x occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters, these are not theological statements, but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. 
in gaits pink rose and stardust, we see empty fields, withered plants and other tokens. father x takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children. he places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles, which is reflected in the painting. children are disfigured, or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents. music is intense, equivalent to the sound created by hildegard von bingen a 12th-century nun and composer. troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait, commentary by father x 
references to mary as a mother are common, as well as other scriptural allusions. all babies jump for jesus in the womb or in its sack of nibbling yoke writes father x. elizabeths child john leapt for joy, just as his ancestor david did before the ark of the covenant, he continues. 
gait addresses the human embryo, finding biblical, ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. her abbey target beginning has a crosshair target, which is interpreted spiritually the first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread  the bread on fire with the holy spirit the same stage of development as the child in marys womb when she arrived at her cousin elizabeths house. 
post-abort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed, but emotionally reacted to in art and word. father x describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals. this contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds. at another point, father-x imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus, a roar of unwanted thoughts. troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait, commentary by father x 
father x elaborates on what gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion. he cites a world built on slavery before christs advent, and the works of such men as william wilberforce and john brown in furthering christs gospel of justice and peace. all this is contrasted to abortion throughout. 
ruminating on gaits palms of our lord, father x claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. palms is murky, with a single, red hand print. to look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the tarot of ruins, he continues. 
suicide advances this dark theme, where gait and father x criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics. he takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings  a caricature of a woman who made a mistake, who got herself in trouble, who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart. 
but all isnt baleful and sad here. in cloud children, father x muses on paper dolls in gaits paintings with this lovely thought where children go  is a mystery.  some say they take their daytime rest in christs tomb in jerusalem, and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled star ships. 
 troubadours sailing hibiscus seas  is a work of meditation, grief counseling, poetry, social commentary and visual art. father x may not reveal his identity here, but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. gait and father x describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families, those phantoms of sorrows, who will never laugh or cry together as a family, because of an abortion. they hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way. 
judith gait is a graduate of california college of arts and crafts and received a masters at oxfords ruskin school of fine drawing. her work is in public and private collections in america and abroad. she is an american citizen, residing in britain. father x is an addictions counselor and writer in great britain, who prefers to remain anonymous.

"comey accused of interfering in us presidential election dispatches from stephen lendman h ad comey recommended hillary be held criminally responsible for mishandling classified state department documents last july, along with perjury for lying to the fbi and congress, a firestorm of criticism wouldnt have followed his friday announcement. 
1. the comey imbroglio 
senate minority leader harry reid d. nv accused him of tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo, saying his action appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another  claiming he may have broken the law, citing the 1939 hatch act an act to prevent pernicious political activities. it prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity  exempting the president, vice president and designated high-level administration officials. proof of intent is required to hold someone culpable under the law. .. according to the wall street journal , within the fbi, there was  sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign. .. in a prominently featured nyt op-ed , law professor richard painter said we cannot allow fbi or justice department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. that is an abuse of power. .. not according to former federal prosecutor daniel richman, saying comeys critics cannot show his letter violated the hatch act unless they can prove that the fbi director was intending to influence the election rather than inform congress, which was his stated aim. .. a sunday released abc newswashington post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support hillary following comeys october surprise. .. the washington post said the justice departments public integrity unit blocked the fbi from investigating the clinton foundation, claiming inadequate evidence to move forward. the department is run by longtime bill and hillary ally, attorney general loretta lynch. last june, she met privately with the former president at phoenixs sky harbor airport while hillary was under fbi investigation  a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body took place. .. in a washington post op-ed , former attorney general eric holder expressed concern about comeys vague letter to congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest  claiming he violated long-standing justice department policies and tradition. .. holder disgraced the office he held. law professor francis boyle called him a total disaster for the united states constitution, the bill of rights, human rights and the rule of law. speaking in florida on sunday, hillary changed the subject, saying  theres a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. we wont be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us. .. clearly, comeys bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her white house bid well know in days. reports indicate the fbi will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former congressman anthony weiners laptop  estranged husband of top hillary aide huma abedin. .. 
it could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond november 8 and januarys inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting hillary, abedin, weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security. 
2. intellectual laziness  self-inflicted political idiocy 
harvard undergrads for hillary 
overwhelming systemic propaganda allied with a pervasive intellectual laziness conspire to keep minds that should know better from seeing the most elementary truths. being officially smart is no vaccine against the brainwash. a ccording to the student newspaper harvard crimsons october survey , 87 of undergrads support hillary. a scant 6 back trump, 5.8 for libertarian gary whats aleppo johnson, and less than 1 for harvard college and medical school graduate jill stein  the only peoples candidate running. .. around one-third of undergrads responded 2,128 out of a total 6,645 student body  so the views of nonrespondents arent known. about 91 are eligible to vote in november. eligibility begins at age 18. a surprising 96 of respondents intend voting, they said. .. the national average is far lower. whether this years contentious election encourages a larger than usual turnout remains to be seen. the crimson poll was conducted from october 10  20  before fbi director comeys october surprise. whether it would have changed the results is unknown. two-thirds of respondents said they support democrat party candidates, 12 calling themselves republicans, 19 saying theyre independents. .. trump and hillary are the most widely reviled presidential aspirants in us history. yet 70 of crimson respondents view her favorably  showing little knowledge of her deplorable public record since the 1990s unless they support her war crimes, racketeering and perjury. what to make of it? undergrads enter harvard and other colleges as teenagers, young and naive as i was when entering the college long ago. .. after graduation, i discovered the meaning of the term commencement. institutions like harvard teach students to be good citizens, omitting the ugly stuff about us imperialism, officials advancing it, waging endless wars of aggression. .. the so-called korean war was ongoing when i was there, an incentive to maintain good grades, stay in school, avoid being drafted and sent to north koreas frozen chosin, an expression used by members of my class. .. the paper chase hollywood film 1973 featured john houseman as stern harvard law school professor charles kingsfield. his most memorable line on day one for first year students was saying you teach yourselves the law, but i train your minds. you come here with a skull full of mush. you leave thinking like a lawyer. .. i began my freshman year with a skull full of mush, gradually extracting it. college and graduate school taught me to think. learning and comprehension mostly came later. the older i get, the greater my understanding of world and national issues. .. im long removed from campus life. back then, students had none of the advantages available today  no computers, no internet. daily writing i dearly love now was a dreaded chore back then  requiring research by rolodex cards and library stacks, a time-consuming process. except for the type primary research i did for my masters thesis, most everything needed today for compositions or articles like mine is available on our desktops. .. its understandable why young minds havent achieved the wisdom of the ages. still its disturbing to find harvard undergrads uninformed and out-of-touch on hillarys deplorable public record  when its so easy to research it and know what she and husband bill are all about. .. why hasnt the harvard student body done its homework for perhaps the most important election in our lifetime. the stakes are huge  possible war on russia with hillary empowered or improved bilateral relations under trump. nothing matters more than saving humanity from the scourge of catastrophic thermonuclear war able to kill us all. note all image captions, pull quotes and commentary by the editors, not the authors about the author stephen lendman lives in chicago. he can be reached at lendmanstephensbcglobal.net . his new book as editor and contributor is titled flashpoint in ukraine us drive for hegemony risks ww iii.    visit his blog site at sjlendman.blogspot.com . subscribe today! nothing to lose, everything to gain. free  safe  invaluable if you appreciate our articles, do the right thing and let us know by subscribing. its free and it implies no obligation to you ever. we just want to have a way to reach our most loyal readers on important occasions when their input is necessary. in return you get our email newsletter compiling the best of the greanville post several times a week.",79,736268,fake

as shocking as this video is , it was made 5 months ago and does not reflect the current race-to-regulate happening right now. whats more, there are still about 26 working days left in the year. 
no one knows what the future holds, but at a pace of well over 1,000 pages weekly, the federal register could easily top 90,000 pages this year. the simple algebra says that at the current pace well add 11,190 pages over the next 44 days, to end 2016 at around 92,830 pages, said ceis clyde wayne crews. 
this is astonishing and should be of great concern, and intolerable, to policymakers. it is remarkable enough that the all-time record has been passed before thanksgiving, he added. obama has promised to regulate by executive authority, but the sheer number of pages of regulations being rushed through is astonishing. 
still, its not a big surprise to cei and other regulation watchdogs. 
the reason, said crews, obama owns seven of the 10 highest-ever federal register counts. 
he called on president-elect trump to make good on campaign promises and cut regulations.

by kevin barrett , veterans today editor 
it is very, very easy to become a holocaust denier. 
i have never denied any holocausts. all i did was say that it looked like bush and cheney and rumsfeld and their friends did 911. out of nowhere, the adl and bnai brith and their ilk all started screaming at me why are you saying that, you anti-semitic holocaust denier?! 
i was labeled a supporter of holocaust deniers on my wikipedia page, even though i knew nothing about the holocaust deniers that some blogger claimed i supported. 
that was roughly from 2006 to 2013. for all those years i couldnt get my wikipedia entry changed, even though it was absurdly false and referenced an unknown blogger as the source. remove the lie, and it would be back up in hours, if not minutes. 
then i was officially labeled a holocaust denier myself  for the first time as far as i know  by jonathan kay in his book among the truthers . kay cites no evidence whatsoever that i have ever denied any holocausts. 
like professor anthony hallwho was suspended from his tenured full professorship at the university of lethbridge because someone planted a genocidal holocaust denying image on his facebook page i support open debate on all holocausts , and all other issues as well. 
let me repeat i dont deny anything. i just support open debate. 
so, using adlbnai brith nomenclature, i guess that makes me in their eyes a holocaust denier. 
since i had better make the best of it, here is a list of the most wonderful things about being a holocaust denier. top 10 reasons to be a holocaust denier 
10 incessantly bombarded with holocaust memorials, holocaust museums, and holocaust references in popular culture, you wont have to get angry and gloomy and depressed and feel guilty if you are not a jew or paranoid if you are a jew but instead can shrug your shoulders and say, it probably wasnt quite that bad and go about your business in a normal frame of mind. the cumulative effect of missing out on all that depression, anger, and guilt will add at least ten years to your life expectancy. 
9 you can retire early and enjoy hobbies and gardening, since you will never work in this town again. with all that extra life expectancy, you will have a very long and productive retirement. 
8 the good news is that when holocaust denial finally becomes cool you will have gotten there first. the bad news is that your retirement may have to continue for many decades for you to live so long. 
7 holocaust denial is rapidly growing industry with openings for authors, documentary filmmakers, persecution victims, and false flag provocateurs for the adl the latter being by far the best-paying category. 
6 you will lose all your friends who were neither terribly smart nor your friends. good riddance! 
5 you may get a chance to rub shoulders with famous people whose lives have recently been glamorized by hollywood, such as david irving. 
4 when you become an erudite and prolific holocaust denying scholar, you can get a job in the field of holocaust studies. since it is in iran, you will need to be fluent in farsi. 
3 you can visit david cole and partake of some of the stash he saved from his republican party animal days . but be careful, since it seems to cause 911 truth denial and other symptoms of possible brain damage . 
2 your intrepid holocaust denying utterances will thrill your friends and mortify your enemies. 
1 european governments will love you so much that next time you take a vacation there, they will insist that your vacation continue indefinitely, and they will even provide you with free food and housing. related posts",224,736267,fake

seth connell reports that a new video released from project veritas provides evidence that hillary clinton herself worked in the operation to rig the election to ensure a win. 
this video is the third installment from project veritas, which has released two previous undercover videos showing democratic operatives discussing highly unethical and illegal campaigning activities. 
the videos revealed such damaging information that two top democratic operatives were released from their position; when people from the clinton camp step down, you know its bad . breaking rigging the election  video iii creamer confirms hillaryclinton involvement  veritas pveritas_action 
 james o'keefe jamesokeefeiii october 24, 2016 
this third installment includes a shocking number of insights into how the democratic party has been running the clinton campaign. several of the most memorable quotes from the video include 
nobody is really supposed to know about me.-aaron black 
so brad, and bob, and lux, and myself are all part of the old school method where, it doesnt matter what the freakin legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherfker. -aaron black 
in regards to the donald duck characters showing up at trump events skalar clinton operative had gone to some buddy of his who is one of her body people and she explained the idea to hillary. and hillary just loved it. let me tell you something, i think she has the right instinct here. this thing is working, is resonating but that story is not exactly what you want to hear about how presidential decision-making happens. -robert creamer 
the coordination between the clinton camp, the dnc, and americans united for change is a rather obvious violation of federal campaign finance laws regarding expenditures. dnc chair donna brazile was also involved in the coordination with the clinton camp as well. 
additionally, robert creamer discussed why the donald duck idea had to be owned by aufc and not by the dnc. 
the duck has to be an americans united for change entity. this had to do only with some problem between donna brazile and abc, which is owned by disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. thats why. its really silly. 
later in the video creamer revealed why that is the case 
donna barzile had a connection with them and she didnt want to get sued. 
and finally, an explicit admission about hillarys desires, straight from creamer himself 
we originally launched this duck because hillary clinton wants the duck. 
watch the full video below 
this certainly seems to be illegal campaigning, based on these videos. one of the interns even stated that there was a whole slew of reasons why responsibilities had to be divvied up, because the whole scheme was a mess. and why is that? because they are violating campaign coordination law, so they have to. 
its truly unbelievable. a plethora of revelations now show us how corrupt hillary clinton and the dnc are, yet there are still millions of people that support them. if these revelations continue, and they still support her, what can you really say? 
when corruption penetrates this deeply, and when the citizens still wholeheartedly back those who are driving the corruption, the country is in serious danger.

"hillary's 33,000 emails might not be 'missing' after all the deleter of the free world hillary's 33,000 emails might not be 'missing' after all files backed up on multiple platforms never subpoened by fbi published 7 mins ago

in a may interview with fbi agents, an executive with the denver contractor that maintained clintons private server revealed that an underling didnt bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to clintons aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to congress.

"identity politics in america a post-mortem here is what eight years of president obamas post-racial reign have wrought.
the weekend before election day, hillary clinton grinned from ear to ear at a cleveland rally while reciting a verse from jay-zs remix of young jeezys my president is black. as the rapper and his black lives matter-promoting wife, beyonce, beamed on stage nearby, pandersuit-clad clinton twanged with a stilted accent
remember, jay memorably said rosa parks sat so martin luther could walk, and martin luther walked so barack obama could run, and barack obama ran so all the children could fly.'
this would be comical if not for the noxious cynicism of it all. clinton may not remember if she was ever aware in the first place, but the original version of my president is black is a brazen middle finger to nonblack america. just a few lines after the verse hillary quoted, the song taunts
hello miss america, hey pretty lady
red, white, and blue flag, wave for me baby
never thought id say this s, baby im good
you can keep your p, i dont want no more bush
no more war, no more iraq
no more white lies, the president is black
so the poster granny for liberal white privilege, groveling for black votes, kissed the rings of celebrity obama bffs jay-z and beyonce by parroting an inflammatory anthem laced with profanities and radical racialized gloating.
could there have been a more perfect beclownment to cap clintons phony-baloney stronger together campaign?
after denigrating millions of trump supporters as deplorable and irredeemable earlier this year, clinton then unctuously confessed on election eve i regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became.
note the classic textbook employment of the passive voice to evade personal responsibility.
the good news is that after being blasted as haters by clintons hate-filled minions, after being slapped down as racial cowards by clintonite holdover eric holder, after being lambasted as xenophobes and nativists by immigration expansionists in both parties, after enduring a string of faked hate crimes blamed on conservatives, after ceaseless accusations of islamophobia in the wake of jihad attacks on american soil, after baseless accusations of homophobia for protesting the governments gay wedding cake coercion, and after mourning a growing list of police officers ambushed and targeted by violent thugs seeking racial vengeance, an undeniable movement of citizens in the 2016 election cycle decided to push back.
when all is said and done, one of the most important cultural accomplishments of donald trumps bid will be the platform he created for americans of all colors, ethnicities, political affiliations, and socioeconomic backgrounds to defy soul-draining identity politics.
beltway chin-pullers expediently focused on trumps white and conservative supporters who are rightly sick and tired of social justice double standards. but they ignored the increasingly vocal constituency of hyphen-free, label-rejecting american people against political correctness who dont fit old narratives and boxes.
and the same never trump pundits and establishment political strategists who gabbed endlessly about the need for minority outreach after 2012 were flummoxed by the blacks, gays, latinos, women and democrats who rallied behind the gop candidate.
the most important speech of the 2016 election cycle wasnt delivered by one of the presidential candidates. it came from iconoclastic silicon valley entrepreneurinvestor and trump supporter peter thiel who best explained the historically significant backlash against the intolerant tolerance mob and phony diversity-mongers.
louder voices have sent a message that they do not intend to tolerate the views of one half of the country, he observed at the national press club last week. he recounted how the gay magazine the advocate, which had once praised him as a gay innovator, declared he was not a gay man anymore because of his libertarian, limited-government politics.
the lie behind the buzzword of diversity could not be made more clear, thiel noted. if you dont conform, then you dont count as diverse, no matter what your personal background.
trumps eclectic coalition was bound by that common thread disaffected individuals tired of being told they dont count and discounted because their views do not properly match their gender, chromosomes, skin color or ethnicity. that is exactly why the more they and their nominee were demonized, the stronger their support grew.
no matter what happens in this election, thiel concluded last week, what trump represents isnt crazy and its not going away. 
hes right. i too often take for granted my own personal awakening about the entrenched tribalism of identity politics at a crazy liberal arts college in the early 1990s. the liberation from collectivist ideology is profound and lasting. witnessing so many outspoken newcomers arrive at this enlightenment, however circuitous the route, has been the most encouraging and underappreciated phenomenon of the 2016 campaign.

"audio wayne allen root shocks trump on air with revelation about dnc lies obamacare architect admits on live tv that this is how obamacare was designed 
the various revelations from wikileaks were also a topic of discussion, with root bringing up a message he had seen from democrat national committee head donna brazile to clinton campaign chair john podesta about just how terrible the economy really was, despite all of the glowing reports and reassurances to the general public from the administration and liberal media. 
trump was actually somewhat shocked by the news, having not seen that particularly incriminating email yet, and begged root to send him a copy or link to it so he could familiarize himself with the details and use it on the campaign trail. 
the topic of voter fraud also came up in the conversation, though the ever-optimistic root insisted that trumps supporters would be capable of overcoming with a massive turnout whatever tricks might be in store. root even jested that trump would actually win the race by 10 points but be declared a winner by only two due to widespread fraud and irregularities.   
you can listen to the entire interview right here, with the interesting bit regarding braziles email to podesta about the economy coming shortly after the eight-minute mark. 
while the discussion was quite encouraging for trump, it was also rather enlightening, as root revealed more of the duplicitous nature of the clinton campaign that trump had not yet been made aware of. 
hopefully trump will follow the advice given him by root and others and keep a focus on obamacare over the remainder of the race, as that issue hits home with virtually all voters and most certainly doesnt help clinton at all.",35,736265,fake
"american revolution has now begun, may last entire decade a sobering new security council  sc  analytical report on the us presidential election states that a new american revolution has begun which todays popular vote is just the beginning of; and that could fully last up to an entire decade, especially if this election is stolen from donald trump. note some words andor phrases appearing in quotes in this report are english language approximations of russian wordsphrases having no exact counterpart.
according to this report, federation intelligence analysts in their decipheringuncovering what the current us presidential election is really all about have heavily relied on outliers a thing situated away or detached from the main body or system such as artificial intelligence  ai  models, social media trends and psychological analysis of the american electorate.
this report notes that the security councils use of these outliers to both understand and explain what is occurring during this us presidential election provides the only proven scientific evidence of what is occurring as the so called polling data used by the american propaganda media has been proven to be nothing more than a manipulation device used to keep people from voting for or supporting the anti-establishment candidate donald trump.
examples of this being true, this report explains, lie in too many examples to fully citebut includes the once respected monmouth university poll found manipulating data to favor hillary clinton , news networks nbc and cbs found manipulating polling data to show hillary clinton leading donald trump when she was actually losing , and cnn manipulating their poll data to favor hillary clinton too .
unlike manipulated polling data showing hillary clinton will win this election, however, this report continues, the objective and independent scientific outliers used by security council research analysts show not only donald trump winningbut winning in a landslide victory.
evidence proving this assertion of a donald trump us presidential win, this report notes, lies first with artificial intelligence analysisthat includes the mogia supercomputer showing trump winning in landslide and showing he is more popular than president obama , and a just released ai computer simulation showing trump winning with 289 electoral votes compared to clintons 249 .
social media trend lines in this election, likewise, proves a donald trump landslide win in this election, this report continues, as his facebook-twitter-instagram-youtube presence dwarfs hillary clintons by a staggering 74 million and that is further validated by the over 700,000 americans who have come to his campaign rallies, as opposed to the barely 60,000 that have attended hillary clintons .
most fascinating though of the outliers used in this security council report is the psychological analysis of the american electorate conducted by a virtually unknown us political project called  we need smith whose scientifically conducted studies shockingly proved that anyone from a liberal democrat, to a conservative republican was able to win the us presidency as long as they promised to destroy the corrupt political system currently ruling america .
the we need smith project, this report explains, is named after a popular us great depression era movie called mr. smith goes to washington about a newly appointed united states senator who fights against a corrupt political systemand that during this present us presidential election only donald trump and us senator bernie sanders fit the mold of.
critical to note about the we need smith project too, this report continues, is that it was co-founded by the legendary american pollster patrick caddell who almost singlehandedly was responsible for putting president jimmy carter in office in 1976, but also presided over carters unprecedented defeat in 1980 at the hands of the us establishments most hated candidate ronald reagan.
seeking to understand how president carter could go from victory to defeat in just 4 years, this report details, patrick caddell spent the past nearly 4 decades examining itand coming to the scientific conclusion that the conventional wisdom that america is absolutely divided into warring tribes is simply not true, they are all just tired of being lied to .
in fact, this report continues, caddells research proved that the american political battleground is no longer over ideology but instead is all about insurgencyand with a staggering 84 of the american public believing that the elites live by a different set of rules and laws than ordinary people do , anyone running against them is assured victory.
interestingly to note too, this report says, is caddells scientific analyses showing that the hatred of the american people towards their elites comes from both the left and right and as evidenced by the equal explosive political movements known as occupy wall street and the tea party insurgencies .
this report grimly concludes, however, with a warning that soviet communist leader joseph stalins attributed statement those who cast the votes decide nothing. those who count the votes decide everything. may, indeed, be active in the present us presidential election after newly released secret documents revealed that hillary clintons main supporter, multi-billionaire george soros, has not only been manipulating the entire american election system , but one of his companies is, also, providing vote county software to 16 states  theyve since denied and that should donald trump have this election stolen from him the people of that nation will most surely revolt.

"russians conduct nuclear-bomb survival drills as cold war heats up bomb shelters are upgraded, gas masks tested amid strained relations between putin and u.s. by thomas grove 
moscowrussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with washington, dusting off soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. 
at the kremlins ministry of emergency situations, the cold war is back. 
the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the u.s.s.r., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. 
videos of emergency workers deployed in hazmat suits or checking the ventilation in bomb shelters were prominently aired on television when the four days of drills were held across the country. students tried on gas masks and placed dummies on stretchers in school auditoriums. 
the capitals civil-defense plans are also being upgraded, said andrey mishchenko, deputy head of the ministry. 
an inventory was taken in moscow of the citys underground spaces, in order to allow us to plan for sheltering 100 of the citys population, he said, as reported by state news agency ria novosti. 
in parallel, commentators on state-dominated airwaves issued some of the shrillest anti-american rhetoric in years. russia is sick of americas arrogant lies, influential commentator dmitry kiselyov said this month after a syrian peace plan collapsed. 
after a mistaken strike by u.s.-led coalition warplanes on syrian troops in september, russias defense ministry warned that its air defense systems could shoot down any american plane that threatened its own forces. 
and when a russian tabloid wrote that government officials had been asked to take their children back from the prestigious preparatory schools and universities they attend in britain, france and the u.s., speculation swirled about preparation for all-out war with the u.s. 
the rhetoric reinforces russians idea that their country is a superpower on par with the u.s. it also offers a distraction from an economic recession and from president vladimir putins approval ratings, which have dipped from recent highs. the threat of nuclear war also keeps the population

как сообщает reuters со ссылкой на геологическую службу сша, это было второе за вечер сильное землетрясение в этом районе. ранее сообщалось о другом землетрясении - магнитудой 5,4.эпицентр второго землетрясения, по данным службы, располагался около города кастельсантанджело-суль-нера центральная область марке. 
по словам мэра мауро фалуччи, в городе отключилось электричество.как отмечает reuters, оба землетрясения были достаточно сильными и их ощутили 150 км южнее - в риме, где лампы закачались на верхних этажах зданий. по данным рбк, власти города виссо, располагающегося недалеко от эпицентра, заявили о нескольких пострадавших. 
по информации геофизической службы ран, на которую ссылается ведомство, сейсмособытие произошло в 915. его эпицентр залегал в акватории тихого океана, в 226 километрах к востоку от города курильска. 
как пишет российская газета, жители островного региона подземных толчков не ощутили. об угрозе возникновения цунами не сообщается. 
правда.ру ранее писала, что в японии сейсмологи зафиксировали землетрясение магнитудой 6,5 - подземные толчки произошли южнее токио в тихом океане. 
как пишет риа новости, о жертвах сообщений нет. в ообщении метеослужбы японии говорится, что очаг подземного толчка находился на глубине 10 км в тихом океане к югу от токио. по японской шкале оценки силы землетрясений, магнитуда этих толчков не превысила 1 балл. 
тем не менее, землетрясение ощущалось в девяти префектурах японии. информации о жертвах и возможных разрушениях пока не поступала, угроза цунами не объявлялась. 
правда.ру ранее писала, что 12 сентября подземные толчки магнитудой 4,9 и 5,4 были зафиксированы возле города кёнджу кёнсан-пукто в 370 км от сеула.

информации о жертвах и разрушениях не поступало. ранее в северной корее был зарегистрирован толчок магнитудой 5,3, что стало следствием ядерных испытаний. 
как уточнили в ведомстве, на пять часов утра по местному времени 23-00 12 сентября по москве общее число пострадавших составило восемь человек, большинство из которых находились рядом с эпицентром толчков пятеро пострадавших - из провинции северная кенсан, двое - из тэгу и еще один - из провинции южная чолла. 
в основном люди пострадали от упавшей мебели и кусков зданий, но два человека получили ранения, когда решили спрыгнуть на землю со второго этажа, испугавшись подземных толчков. в то же время ранения у всех легкие, жизни пострадавших угрозы нет, пишет правда.ру. 
23 августа в италии произошло землетрясение магнитудой 6,4 . подземные толчки зафиксированы недалеко от города перуджа.

"most bavarians have negative attitude toward muslims in germany  poll most bavarians have negative attitude toward muslims in germany  poll   1842 get short url  michaela rehle  reuters more than four in five people in the german state of bavaria have a negative attitude toward muslims, a new study has found, also reporting that refugees, the long-term unemployed and roma community are generally perceived negatively. 
more than half of the population of bavaria demonstrated either moderate or strong antipathy towards muslims living in germany, a study conducted by the social studies institute of the ludwig maximilian university lmu in munich said . it also reported that another 34 percent of bavarians said they had slight dislike for followers of islam. read more merkel suggests christmas carols, flute-playing in face of islam concerns 
only 11 percent of respondents said they had no bad feelings about muslims living in germany, the research published on monday added. 
the study was based on a comprehensive survey that examined peoples attitudes towards eight different distinct groups of society  muslims, refugees, jews, roma, foreigners in general, as well as people of a different race, homosexuals and the long-term unemployed. 
it featured from three to 10 questions that varied depending on each group in focus and that were presented in the form of statements that the respondents had to agree or disagree with. 
the study particularly featured such statements as there are too many muslims in germany,foreignersrefugees endanger my financial situationpersonal way of living, and many long-time unemployed people systematically shy away from work. 
the research was conducted between april and june 2016 and relied on surveying people from more than 1,700 households across bavaria. 
of all the groups in question, muslims were the only one that stirred up strong negative feelings among more than 20 percent of the bavarian population, while in all other cases it never exceeded 10 percent, and was between 3 and 6 percent on average. 
however, muslims were not the only group that was perceived mostly negatively by bavarians. the second most negatively perceived group was actually the long-time unemployed, as more than 80 percent of bavarians had at least slightly negative attitude towards them, although only 4 percent had a strong animosity towards this section of society. read more syrian refugee in germany with 4 wives, 22 kids sparks social media fuss over welfare 
refugees and the roma gypsy community were also among the groups that were viewed least favourably, as only 27 percent of bavarians had no negative feelings towards each of these groups. ten percent of bavarians said they had a strong negative attitude towards roma  the second highest figure among all the groups in focus. 
in the case of refugees, about a third of bavarians held either moderate or strong antipathy towards them. 
at the same time, the study showed that people of bavaria have no negative attitude towards foreigners living in germany in general as 56 percent of respondents said they had no bad feelings towards foreigners and only 10 percent of those questioned demonstrated moderate or high level of animosity towards them. 
bavarians were also almost equally tolerant towards gay people as 54 percent of respondents showed no antipathy towards them. they were also even less prone to what the study called classic racism that consists in viewing white people more positively than the people of other races. about three quarters of respondents showed no signs of racism at all, while only about 10 percent of them had moderate or strong racist views. 
the study also showed that men are more prone to various forms of negative attitude towards the distinct groups in focus than women as well as that people having higher level of education tend to be more tolerant and less prejudged towards all these groups. read more merkel ally promotes german islam as means to integrate refugees into liberal eu society 
the research also stressed people that have a strong national identity or have low level of trust to the political institutions are also inclined to have a negative attitude towards the distinct groups mentioned in the study. 
however, the results of the study provoked significant concerns among social scientists, activists and even some churchmen. in general, there is already a clear negative attitude towards various distinct groups, christian ganser, a social scientist from the lmu, told german media, adding that group-focused hostility is a widespread phenomenon in bavaria. 
the present social developments that concern negative attitudes towards various groups of society do not fit into the classic conception of right wing extremism, miriam heigl, an expert from the center for democracy of munich, told dpa news agency. 
animosity towards distinct groups is no more a phenomenon linked only to some fringe extremist groups, ganser, who is a co-author of the study, stressed, adding that it is now a phenomenon related to the average people. 
to harbor a pejorative attitude towards others out of fear to lose own identity is no christian way, martin schneider, a member of the catholic township council of munich, told german kna news agency, commenting on the results of the study. he added that those, who ostracize outsiders, go against jesus christ. 
at the same time, the issue is not limited to bavaria, as sentiments similar to those presented in the study are common across the whole of germany, ralf melzer, who works for the friedrich ebert foundation, told dpa. read more massive pegida rally in dresden marks 2 years of anti-immigrant movement video 
on october 22, two days before the study was published, german chancellor angela merkel suggested that any germans concerned about islam should combat the perceived islamization of germany with flute-playing and christmas carols. 
i know there are concerns about islam, she said at a congress of her party, the christian democratic union, in the state of mecklenburg-western pomerania, while calling on people to rely on their christian values and traditions to tackle this challenge. 
on october 3, the german finance minister and close merkel ally, wolfgang schaeuble, called for the creation of german islam that would combine traditional islamic norms with the principles of tolerance and european liberalism to help integrate millions of refugees from the middle east into european and particularly german society. 
meanwhile, the anti-muslim and anti-migrant sentiments in germany are on the rise as the populist alternative for germany afd party gains strong support at the expense of merkels christian democrats.

"busted trump supporters get caught creating fake badges to intimidate voters at polling places  addicting info  the knowledge you crave on october 27, 2016 253 am  
conservatives claim that voter id is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out theyre the only ones creating fake ids to use on election day. 
trump supporters are taking trumps call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake id badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them  all of which are illegal. 
but, trumps deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as vote protectors. 
the group, which is affiliated with top trump ally roger stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on election day. they are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. 
according to the huffington post , 
stones group created an official-looking id badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake exit polls, efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. or at least thats what the group was planning to do before the huffington post asked stone about it on tuesday. the controversial trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his groups websites were there without his knowledge, and assured huffpost that he would operate within the confines of election law. 
in fact, after huffpo confronted stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that vote protectors had a bad idea and ordered them taken down. 
campaign legal center deputy director danielle lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. 
its inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy, she told huffpo in reference to the videotaping. when thats being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it. 
indeed, but thats exactly what donald trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. 
as it turns out, hes right about the election being rigged, only its conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of trump. 
earlier this week, a wisconsin city clerk in green bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the wisconsin ethics commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the university of wisconsin-green bay because she has merely heard that students lean democrat. 
i was reading the statutes and read no site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party, republican appointed clerk kris teske wrote. 
uwgb is a polling location for students and residents on election day but i feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. i have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. i have spoken with our chief of staff and others at city hall and they agree that budget wise this isnt going to happen. i would like to know your thoughts on this. do i have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. 
so not only are trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. 
and that is likely going to cause a lot of election day chaos. voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what trumps deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.

"3 thoughts on steve bannon as white house chief strategist - dailywire.com 3 thoughts on steve bannon as white house 'chief strategist' by ben shapiro november 14, 2016 
so, in a not-unexpected move, donald trump has elevated former breitbart news ceo steve bannon to chief strategist of the white house. 
when i left breitbart back in march, i accused bannon of turning breitbart news into trump pravda ; as i wrote, indeed, breitbart news, under the chairmanship of steve bannon, has put a stake through the heart of andrews legacy. in my opinion, steve bannon is a bully, and has sold out andrews mission in order to back another bully, donald trump; he has shaped the company into trumps personal pravda, to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter. 
that decision paid off for bannon  in august, he became trumps campaign ceo. at that point, i wrote this piece describing who bannon was , and this one for the washington post describing his probable impact on the campaign . 
with bannons accession to a top white house role, its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do. 
is bannon anti-semitic and racist? i have no evidence that bannons a racist or that hes an anti-semite; the huffington posts blaring headline white nationalist in the white house is overstated, at the very least. with that said, as i wrote at the washington post in august, bannon has openly embraced the racist and anti-semitic alt-right  he called his breitbart  the platform of the alt-right . milo yiannopoulos, the star writer at the site, is an alt-right popularizer , even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member. the lefts opposition to trump, and their attempts to declare all trump support the alt-right have obfuscated what the movement is. the movement isnt all trump supporters. its not conservatives unsatisfied with paul ryan, nor is it people angry at the media. bannon knows that. hes a smart man, not an ignorant one. the alt-right, in a nutshell, believes that western culture is inseparable from european ethnicity . i have no evidence bannon believes that personally. but hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into european far-right nationalist populism. that means that the alt-right will cheer bannon along as he marbles trumps speeches with talk of globalism  and that bannon wont be pushing trump to dump the racists and anti-semites who support trump anytime soon. after all, they love bannon  actual white supremacists like peter brimelow called his august appointment great news, and richard spencer explained, breitbart has elective affinities with the alt right, and the alt right has clearly influenced breitbart. in this way, breitbart has acted as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers. i dont think it has done this deliberately; again, its a matter of elective affinities. that doesnt mean bannon will push racist or anti-semitic policy, or that hell be anti-israel himself  unless it serves his interests. 
what does bannons accession mean? bannon has goals. one of those goals is maximization of personal power, which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful right-wing personalities bachmann, morris, palin, kissing their asses, and then moving on up the chain. with breitbart and trump, he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of american power. 
so, what will he do with that power? hell target enemies. bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics, which is why ive been joking for months that should trump win, id be expecting my irs audit any moment. that wasnt completely a joke. he likes to destroy people. 
but more importantly, bannons interested in turning the republican party into a far-right european party. because republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that, it could happen. heres what i wrote in march about the trump movement  
trump is a european-style response to the european-style leftism of barack obama. hes a soft european-style populist, from his interventionist economics to his closed-borders foreign policy. as i wrote in december, compare trumps platform with that of marine le pen, whose french national front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment. she calls for harsher penalties for criminals, significant restrictions on muslim immigration to france, protectionism on trade, a restoration of the franc as the national currency rather than the euro, and big government in terms of health care. this sounds a lot like trump. but the european right is not the american right. the american right believes in constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government. the european right doesnt believe any of these things. should trump win, we could watch american conservatism lose the only party it has ever had. 
thats the plan. yesterday, the daily beast reported that bannon reached out to le pen for global ultra-right coalition. over the weekend le pen met with nigel farage of the uk independent party. and trump met with farage shortly after being elected. bannon has always wanted to burn down the gop. thats still his goal. he wants it replaced with an american national front party in fact if not in name. 
which war will bannon lead? bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war. always. so the only question left is this what will bannons actual role be? its difficult to tell, since trump announced the bannon hire at the same time he announced that former rnc chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff. what will their relationship be like? ed morrissey of hotair thinks that bannon will lead the anti-media fight, and reince will coordinate with congress. that would be the best possible scenario. 
others have speculated that bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base, which would be angry at trump hopping into bed with the most establishment-y fellow in washington. that, too, would be fine. 
its hard to tell from the outside whats happening, but heres a third theory reince is the bagman for trump, and bannons whispering in trumps ear. that would fit the fact pattern here, given reinces outsized praise for bannon this morning wise and smartvery, very smart, very temperate. bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree. hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees; he's actually malevolent. priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because hes the one catering to bannons agenda. 
if bannons leading and reince is following, that bodes ill for the republican agenda. bannon opposes the republican party, hates paul ryan  minutes after the joint bannonpriebus announcement, breitbart news approvingly tweeted about a congressional rebellion against speaker ryan  and wants to watch it all burn. bannon loves the firefight. the only question is which direction hell turn his fire. tags",43,736282,real
"jill stein issues last warning do not vote for hillary or its mushroom clouds everywhere âœget ready for war with russiaâ if hillary clinton is elected president, said progressive green party presidential nominee jill stein.
âœthis election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,â stein warned, explaining that clintonâs trigger-happy militarism âœis a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.â
while stein adamantly opposes a trump presidency, she explained that the dangers posed by a clinton presidency are âœarguably even more immediate and intense.â
stein blasted clintonâs âœwarmongeringâ that âœalmost singlehandedlyâ brought us the turmoil in libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if clinton were elected president.
âœhillary brought us libya almost singlehandedly,â stein explained in a thursday fox business interview. she continued
and she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. like it or not, russia has the sanction of international law to be there. for us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with russia. both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. this is the most dangerous momentâ according to the former president of the soviet union, mikhail gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever.
stein elaborated on this view during a facebook live interview with progressive marc lamont hill, who has endorsed stein over clinton âœin this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,â stein said, adding
not only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where hillary has this proven track record âś of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and sheâs calling for a no-fly zone in syria, which means weâre essentially declaring war on russia if hillary gets electedâdeclaring war on russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the russians on hair trigger alert. this is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. so itâs really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.
âœno one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having hillary in white house. in some ways, theyâre arguably even more immediate and intense,â stein said. âœbut the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and, really, across the worldâthis movement that puts people, planet, and peace over profit.â
âœitâs very clear what kind of a trend weâre on,â stein explained
this is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. where is the exit strategy if you buy into this idea that one must vote for one of the major parties? it means that in every election, we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving wall street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy. âś there is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. it means with each race, we come closer and closer to the cliff.
âœwe must find and elect alternatives to the wall street-backed oligarchy, the warmongers, and the anti-humanitarians,â stein wrote on twitter.
stein, who has previously described clinton as âœqueen of corruption,â attacked clinton for her questionable ties to qatar and saudi arabia
during her interview with stein, fox business host kennedy blasted other members of the mainstream media for ignoring and trying to âœsmotherâ steinâs âœauthenticâ and âœinterestingâ candidacy.
âœiâm surprised that the mainstream media has taken an interesting, authentic candidate like yourselfâ they were so obsessed with bernie sandersâ and youâve got someone, the embodiment of this new and interesting political tapestry, and theyâve essentially ignored you and smothered your candidacy,â kennedy said.
stein agreed and said that the corporate mediaâs blackout of her campaign and their perpetuation âœspeaks volumes.â she said, âœmy campaign is a very inconvenient truth that there is a politics of integrity out there. âś every day, there are more revelations how both âś trump and clinton are walking, talking scandal machines, and people are clamoring for something else.â she added, âœthe corporate media, the apologists for the democrats and republicans, and the political pundits are doing everything they can to intimidate people into voting for the system thatâs throwing them under the bus.â

"money laundering scheme exposed 14 pro-clinton super pacs, nonprofits implicated theres a reason david brock, founder of the liberal group media matters for america, chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super pacs and nonprofits.
professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts. brock wants his unregistered solicitor, the bonner group, to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason.
david brock is laundering money 
 
related stories consumers need protection from new consumer protection bureau rule heres what the markets are telling us exposed profiteers of governing  and these are the ones who got caught! brock has seven nonprofits, three super pacs, one 527 committee, one llc, one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in washington .
uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations.
the bonner group, his professional solicitor, works off a commission. every time money gets passed around, bonner receives a 12.5 percent cut.
 
follow the money 
nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants.
but they arent required to disclose who gives them cash grants.
this weak system of one-way verification is being abused by brock. hes been cycling money between his organizations for years, and the bonner groups 12.5 percent commission gets triggered after every pass.
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias, trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency in 2014, media matters for america raised more than 10 million.
the bonner group was credited for raising these funds. media matters paid it a 1.1 million commission.

that same year, media matters gave a 930,000 cash grant to brocks franklin education forum , an organization that shares office space with media matters.

in 2014, the franklin education forum reported 994,000 in total contributions, and 93.6 percent of that total came from media matters.
surprisingly, though, the franklin education forum gave full credit to bonner for raising that money. it paid the fundraiser a 124,250 commission in 2014.

notice what happened? 
brocks media matters gave a 930,000 cash grant to brocks franklin education forum. brocks franklin education forum credited the bonner group for raising those funds, triggering the 12.5 percent commission. brock paid the bonner group a 124,250 commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself! it doesnt stop there 
after the franklin education forum retained 869,750, it sent a 816,224 cash grant to brocks franklin forum . 

note the franklin education forum is a 501c3, and the franklin forum is a 501c4. they are not the same company. 
the franklin forum 501c4 paid bonner a commission in 2013 , so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a 102,028 commission in 2014. unfortunately, its hard to tell for sure. it still hasnt filed its taxes for 2014!
lets recap 
say, for example, you donate 1,062,857 to media matters for america. this is how david brock would have used your charitable donation in 2014
media matters would receive your 1,062,857 donation. the bonner group would earn a 132,857 commission. media matters would retain 930,000. next, media matters would give whats left of your entire donation , 930,000, to the franklin education forum. the bonner group would earn a 116,250 commission. the franklin education forum would retain 813,750. the franklin education forum would then forward the remaining 813,750 to the franklin forum. the bonner group would earn a 101,718 commission. the franklin forum would retain 712,031. in the end, brocks solicitor would have pocketed 350,825, almost a third of your initial donation. thats a far cry from the advertised 12.5 percent commission.
as bizarre as that scenario may sound, this is exactly what brock did in 2014.
how can we be sure this is intentional? 
brock is the chairman for each of these organizations. how could he not know whats going on?
hes a hands-on chairman. according to their tax returns, brock allocates time, weekly, to his organizations
media matters 31.50 hours per week franklin education forum three hours per week the franklin forum one hour per week furthermore, the new york times reports that brock shares a summer rental in the hamptons with mary pat bonner, the president of the bonner group.
brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this. these transfers are intentional. he vacations with his solicitor. case closed.
still not convinced? 
brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers. they all share the same number.

what if ? 
we even located the bonner groups solicitation agreement with media matters on floridas gift givers guide . clarification on the commission can be found on page 2

in english contractually, brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission. in spite of this option, he intentionally chooses to trigger the 12.5 percent commission for money grants between his organizations.
note yes, we are making the assumption that all of brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the bonner group. given that his organizations share the same address, board members and telephone number, we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement. 
this barely scratches the surface 
utilizing public-facing tax returns, along with records submitted to the federal election commission, we mapped out all the significant money transfers from 2014 that took place in brocks office

summary 
this is all from just one year! no further commentary required.
we understand this may be hard to believe. we first came across this in july, and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it.
all of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources. check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in brocks office. these data have been sitting out in the open, gathering dust for years. 
if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.
weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity. but there arent any loopholes. david brock has something to hide. just last month, the daily caller reported the following
brocks former long-time live-in boyfriend william grey whom brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the irs with damaging information about how brock was running his media matters empire. what did brock do? he paid grey 850,000 to keep quiet. brock reportedly had to sell his home in rehoboth, delaware, to come up with the money. this certainly seems to indicate that brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover.
adding to this, fox news reported the following
grey accused brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine brocks fundraising efforts.
next step is i contact all your donors and the irs, grey wrote in an email dated may 19, 2010. this is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.'
we believe that the information presented in this article is what has brock so terrified. we feel confident in saying, with close to absolute certainty, that david brock is laundering money through his media matters conglomerate.

"trump crushed by hillary clintons new powerful closing argument to women the hillary clinton supporting priorities usa super pac has released a powerful ad that makes the closing argument for why women should get out to vote and support the democratic nominee. 
video 
the ad is set to the carole king classic natural woman as sung by her daughter. the ad features clips of ordinary women living their lives mixed with clips of elinor roosevelt, rosa parks, sally ride, and hillary clinton. two-thirds of the way through the ad, trump appears and audio of him calling women fat pigs, slobs, fat asses, and flat chested among other insults. on the screen are shots of women holding up up cards with the hashtag vote. 
the message is clear, powerful, and absolutely devastating. 
women need to vote against the behavior of donald trump. the words of donald trump and his treatment of women must be rejected. it is time for all americans of conscience to lead the way, but if we are realistic about us society, it will be women who lead the way. women will provide the moral voice that rejects trump. according to the polling, it will be women who lead the way for hillary clinton to win the presidential. 
cnn asked the trump campaign for comment about the ad, and their request was met with silence because donald trumps own words did all the talking that voters need to hear.",133,736268,real
"donald trump may have broken the law to avoid paying federal income taxes by sean colarossi on mon, oct 31st, 2016 at 952 pm trump used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited. share on twitter print this post 
while donald trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades, the new york times reported on monday that trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share. 
according to the times, the republican nominee used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited. 
the report 
tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for the new york times said mr. trumps tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. whatever loophole existed was not exploited here, but stretched beyond any recognition, said steven m. rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s. 
moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of american tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to mr. trump for losing vast amounts of other peoples money  in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in atlantic city. 
the reason that trump bent over backward  and potentially broke laws  to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to stave off financial ruin. 
this is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his successful business background. 
yet, he calls himself the king of debt. his businesses have declared bankruptcy six times. he has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes. he lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business. reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to russia. 
all of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background. 
even as all of this information is out there, american voters still know very little about donald trumps finances because he has refused to be transparent about them. 
and consider this what trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting. if it werent, he would have already released them. 
the latest new york times story is just the latest installment of trumps shady business background. the media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the countrys pocketbook.",133,736269,real

"limbaugh democrats would 'destroy jesus christ' actor jim caviezel portraying jesus in the passion of the christ. 
jesus christ of nazareth is not the republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
but if he were, democrats would try to destroy him in the same manner theyre attacking the 2016 gop candidate, donald trump. 
thats according to radio host rush limbaugh, who hypothesized what this years race would look like if the son of god were at the top of the republican ticket. 
should president trump try to prosecute hillary? sign the hottest petition in america now to show your support! 
it doesnt matter who the republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment trumps getting. it wouldnt have mattered, limbaugh said wednesday. 
they would go out of their way to find ways to destroy jesus christ if he could be nominated as a republican. the democrats would do everything they could, include calling him a liar, the bible a fake book, whatever it took. rush limbaugh 
and despite the fact the bible never indicates jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, limbaugh suggested democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of his offspring 
they would scour the historical record looking for children he had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit jesus. thats who they are. thats what they would do. 
limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that republicans would never escape this kind of media assault based on who we nominate. donald trumps rnc acceptance speech photo screenshot from rnc live feed 
i say this because a lot of you never trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like trump. no, its exactly what you get when you nominate a republican. whenever there is any opposition to the democrats, this is what they do. it doesnt matter. theyre gonna do it. they did it to romney  
ive made this point til i blue in the face. they turned romney, who is mild-mannered mr. gosh, cant even get noticed into the biggest walking satan, el diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick so this is why i think trump has so many people supporting him. hes fighting back against it when most republicans havent and dont. 
as an example of how media treatment of republicans has not changed, limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from cbs. commentator bill moyers characterized the race before it was known that republican ronald reagan would easily defeat democrat jimmy carter. moyers stated 
those of you who might speak spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember, said carter, whos been your friend. and there under the california sun in san diego at a shopping center, ronald reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which hes been a master since his days at eureka college. suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their era signs. reagan took his cue and snapped back, aw, shut up! 
and thousands of supporters roared their approval. those are the people for whom ronald reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. jimmy carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, enoughs enough. 
does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world? limbaugh asked. not an iota!

"u.s. takes a stab at a no fly zone in two places  syria and standing rock by brandon turbeville 
as the united states marches forward with its war of terror abroad it is, as predicted by researchers and informed observers many years ago, clamping down on the domestic population at home. indeed, it is virtually inevitable that the great eating machine of the empire returns home to be turned on the people who ignored it while it was grinding up so many innocent lives overseas. 
so as the war drums beat louder and as america ekes closer toward the impending clinton coronation and the possibility of the declaration of yet another  no fly zone , this time over syria, becomes more and more likely, it is poetic justice that a no-fly zone is being declared inside the united states. 
while russia stands in the way of americas march to create libya 2.0 in syria, there is no one willing and virtually no one able to stand in the way of americas declaration of war on itself, personified by the vicious police state brutality being visited upon the protestors at standing rock  indigenous and otherwise  and the crackdown on virtually every amendment to the constitution including the arrest of demonstrators and journalists, some of whom are facing incredibly ridiculous amounts of time in jail. 
indeed, the united states has even declared a no-fly zone over the protest area, preventing media coverage of the ensuing bravery of the protesters and brutality of the serve and protect crew who are willing to bash every skull and crush every human right in the quest to just do their jobs. 
one need only take a look at the photos of the protesters vs the heavily armed and militarized police can we still call them police? forces amassed around the location to see the crumbling of america into the police state foreseen for western countries as the rug gets pulled out from under them economically, socially, and culturally despite their use as tools of imperialism abroad. the blunt hammer of anglo-american hegemony that is the united states is falling apart even as it continues to strike at syria, iran, and russia. 
while police can murder with impunity and black lives matter activists can destroy cities at will, standing rock protesters are charged with high crimes for spray painting bulldozers; and journalists who dare to even cover the protests are arrested and charged with trespassing, inciting riots, and conspiracy. even left gatekeepers like amy goodman have been charged with such crimes. but, while goodmans charges were eventually dropped, other journalists such as deia schlosberg face 45 years in prison simply for filming a protest that involved the disruption of the pipelines operations. 
in regards to the current events taking place at standing rock, jay syrmopoulos writes , 
this latest flashpoint in the ongoing conflict is north of the larger and more permanent encampments, which have been constructed on federally owned land where over 200 native american tribes have gathered to oppose the pipelines construction. 
on wednesday, a heavily militarized law enforcement presence began mobilizing heavy equipment, including humvees, armored personnel carriers, and buses and demanded the protesters leave the occupied area. 
in an ominous sign, the federal aviation administration faa has restricted flights , and banned the use of drones within a radius of about 4 ½ miles of cannon ball. the faa declared that only aircraft affiliated with the north dakota tactical operation center are allowed within the restricted airspace. the flight restriction went into effect wednesday and will last until november 5. 
indian country today reports  
what began with prayers and a single tipi alongside highway 1806 quickly grew to more than a dozen tipis surrounded by tents, buses, cars and hundreds of water protectors. some are calling it the 1851 treaty camp to acknowledge their treaty rights. 
across the road is the encroaching pipeline and a heavily militarized police force with armored vehicles, helicopters, planes, atvs and busloads of officers. tensions are growing as unarmed citizens worry that police will use unnecessarily harsh tactics. 
in recent weeks, nearly 300 unarmed water protectors who were arrested have been subjected to pepper spray, strip-searches, delayed bail, exaggerated charges and physical violence, according to interviews with several who were taken into custody. the aclu and national lawyers guild recently sent attorneys to standing rock to help the red owl collective, a team of volunteer lawyers headed by attorney bruce ellison, who are representing many of those arrested. 
the massive law enforcement contingent, consisting of sheriffs deputies and officers from numerous other states and counties, as well as national guard, began staging near the encampment  with scores of armored personnel carriers, buses and humvees poised at the ready. 
at some point the rule of law has to be enforced, cass county sheriff paul laney said wednesday. we could go down there at any time. were trying not to. 
dakota access llc, the pipeline developer released a statement encouraging trespassers to vacate the land immediately or be removed from the land. 
alternatively and in coordination with local law enforcement and countystate officials, all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land, the company said. lawless behavior will not be tolerated. 
just days ago, sheriffs officials had said earlier they didnt have the resources to immediately remove activists from the private land, about 50 miles south of bismarck. subsequently, law enforcement officials put out a call for reinforcements, with hundreds of officers from out of state responding. 
so there is an official no fly zone over the standing rock protest which can be seen here at the faa website  and, on the ground, we have an army of storm troopers no doubt eager to bust heads and fire off some rounds into a group of people who only want clean water, property rights, and the honoring of the legal agreements they signed. 
across the ocean, however, we await another no fly zone with the creeping clinton coronation and possibly even a last stab by the obama administration once the fix for hitlery is officially in. 
in the last of three presidential in name only debates, clinton stated clearly her support for war in syria by virtue of establishing a no fly zone. she stated , 
im going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within syria not only to help protect the syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the syrian government and the russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track. 
of course, the establishment of a no-fly zone is tantamount to a declaration of war . such has even been admitted by top u.s. generals when explaining exactly what a no fly zone would entail. as general carter ham stated , 
we should make no bones about it. it first entails killing a lot of people and destroying the syrian air defenses and those people who are manning those systems. and then it entails destroying the syrian air force, preferably on the ground, in the air if necessary. this is a violent combat action that results in lots of casualties and increased risk to our own personnel. 
general philip breedlove also echoed this description when he said, 
i know it sounds stark, but what i always tell people when they talk to me about a no-fly zone is . . . its basically to start a war with that country because you are going to have to go in and kinetically take out their air defense capability 
when senator roger wicker asked gen. joe dunford what it would take to impose a no fly zone upon syria, the general responded , right now for us to control all of the airspace in syria would require us to go to war against syria and russia. 
thus, the entire western sphere of influence is slowly descending down to become a place of no fly zones, riot police, and a boot slowly stamping on the human face. at home, those individuals who resist the new normal will be steadily dealt with either by economic hardship or a rude reminder that dissenters will be silence, imprisoned, or killed. 
elsewhere, however, the anglo-american system has begun to encounter nations who are not only willing to fight back but who are able to do so. a dying empire caught in its death throes, trying to remain alive by creating the absence of dissent might well launch a third world war with a nuclear power as a last stab at hegemony. 
on the other hand, rome could just burn slowly. 
rest assured, however, the skies above the city will be empty.",73,736266,fake

moscow, russia  with all eyes on russias unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile icbm, which nato has dubbed the satan missile , as tensions with the u.s. increase, moscows most potent weapon may be something drastically different. 
the rapidly evolving geopolitical weapon brandished by russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as russias native currency, the ruble. 
take a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order  potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift  and much sooner than you might think. 
the symbol is the new designation of the russian ruble, russias national currency. 
similar to how the u.s. uses the dollar sign , the u.k. uses the pound sign , and the european union uses the euro symbol , russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. 
after the failed reset in u.s.russian relations by the obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, washington began targeting entire sectors of the russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force moscow into compliance. 
instead of decimating russia, what it precipitated was a russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the u.s. petrodollar, and working with china to create an alternative to the swift payment system that isnt solely controlled by western interests see asian infrastructure investment bank , new development bank. 
according to the corbett report  
new reports indicate that china is ready to launch its swift alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the brics-led resistance bloc breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the us-led washington consensus. 
for those who dont know, swift stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and is shorthand for the swiftnet network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. swift does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. still, given the systems near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the swift network. 
this is why de-listing from the swift network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the us and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. 
recently, financial guru jim rickards, author of the book currency wars, wrote that russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. russian bonds and stocks and the russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit. rickards believes a strong turnaround is coming within russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. 
while still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the u.s., russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the russian economy being devastated by the whims of washington. 
the bank of russia, that nations central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website 
monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of russian citizens. the bank of russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. given structural peculiarities of the russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4 by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. 
in laymans terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are an integral part of the state policy in russia. while many analysts have noted the increased build-up in russias military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of russian gold reserves over the past decade. 
below is a chart showing russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015 
since 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. the chart clearly reveals that russias state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. additionally, the russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. from 2006 to 2015, russias state holdings of gold tripled. 
within just the past year russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
according to the business insider  
in july of this year, the central bank of russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. the one-month uptick in russian gold reserves  200,000 ounces  is approximately equal to the entire annual output of barrick golds turquoise ridge gold mine in nevada. 
at that same rate  200,000 ounces per month  in a mere five months, russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of barricks massive goldstrike mine in nevada. 
currently, russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. its clear that there is a concerted effort by russian authorities to build up the countrys gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the united states. 
rickards, in his 2011 book currency wars, theorized that russia and china could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the u.s. dollar. currently, russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes according to china  its likely more, which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. 
the u.s. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the international monetary fund imf, thus the u.s. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to business insider. 
imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that russian-chinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the imfs gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. russian, chinese and imf gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the u.s. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. 
russia and china have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by washington as its weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall  thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. 
the reality is that the united states is 20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the u.s. economy begins to implode  and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on. hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the u.s. using the petrodollar as a weapon. 
its not russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. the true threat to america is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the rights of corporations over that of people . 
ultimately, the united states, russia and china are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the imf, the world bank, swift, new development bank and the asian infrastructure investment bank. share google  t. mohr

i cant believe how much my worldview has shifted over the last year. hailing from the radical left, i have felt the pull of history in a new direction. i have become a critic of the social engineering that has been carried out since the 60s; it has gone too far. because of this over-reach, i have had to shift to defending the foundations of our society; community and family. on the hand, i will always be proud to have stood against the empire and the ruling class capitalists. the right was very happy to stay quiet while the financial-military empire raped the world, and we always told you these chickens would come home to roost. but now that they have, it is time to call a truce. 
i propose that we call a halt to the culture wars; this is the area where the left is winning. i think we need to pause to assess the damage of this 50-year project anyway; the baby has almost been washed out of the bath. then the patriotic left the anti-imperialcapitalist faction and the right can join against our common enemy. the division over social issues has been exploited by our enemy to prevent us joining on the political front. this must end, time for all people to come together against the evil which rules our world. 
the momentum is with the right, so i am coming over to join my brothers and sisters to fight our common enemy. i am worried about playing with nationalism, it has a very bloody history, and will put a lot of pressure on our minorities. they will try and turn our nationalism outwards, towards a fake external enemy. the enemy is inside the gates. if we all stand together and maintain our focus, there is nothing they can do. 
i am going to keep asking everybody to stop falling into the left-right trap. the patriotic-national left and right need to join, and anyone pushing social change during this war needs to see they are aiding the enemy. once we are free, we can address the remaining social issues. a truce then, and all patriots rally to the banner. the essential saker from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world 27.95",194,736283,fake

как сообщает associated press со ссылкой на документы судебных органов, ""секретная информация, украденная бывшим подрядчиком агентства национальной безопасности, включает в себя имена тайных сотрудников разведки"". 
по данным российской газеты, защита 51-летнего гарольда томаса мартина iii глен берни будет просить федерального судью в пятницу рассмотреть вопрос об освобождении его клиента из-под стражи на том основании, что следствие по этому делу продолжается. 
судья дэвид кпперзайт отклонил подобную просьбу на прошлой неделе, согласившись с прокуратурой, что освобождение мартина представляет риск, якобы потому, что ""враги соединенных штатов хотели бы узнать больше о секретной информации, найденной в его доме"". 
защита мартина настаивает на версии, что бывший лейтенант вмс сша просто ""увлекся"", взяв документы на дом в надежде усовершенствовать свои навыки и стать более опытным специалистом в своем деле. 
адвокаты говорят, что их клиент ""любит свою семью и свою страну"", и что нет никаких доказательств того, что он поделился информацией с иностранным государством или намеревался сделать это. 
фирма booz allen hamilton, где он работал, уволила мартина, как только узнала о его аресте, и заявила в четверг, что наняла бывшего директора фбр роберта мюллера, чтобы пересмотреть свою практику безопасности. 
как сообщает reuters, гарольд томас мартин работал в той же компании booz allen hamilton, что и эдвард сноуден. напомним, сноуден в 2013 году передавший в прессу разоблачительные материалы о действиях спецслужб сша. 
по словам помощника генерального прокурора сша по национальной безопасности джона карлина, ""возможна ситуация, когда ""во второй раз за три года сотрудник сумел похитить у анб строго засекреченную информацию, нанеся серьезный ущерб"". 
сообщается, что изначально мартин отрицал свою вину, но позже на допросе в фбр признался в краже секретных данных.

"media claim trump transition chaos. trump's way ahead of schedule.  daily wire media claim trump transition chaos. trump's way ahead of schedule. by ben shapiro november 18, 2016 
the media, desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming trump administration as dangerously incompetent, are once again overplaying their hands. instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that trump relies heavily on his son-in-law, jared kushner, and his daughter, ivanka  he invited them to a state meeting with japan  theyre trying to claim that he just isnt moving fast enough on appointments. 
thats nuts. 
barack obama didnt name his picks for secretary of state, defense, or attorney general until december 1, nearly a month after the november 4, 2008 election. george w. bush didnt name his picks for state, defense, or attorney general until mid-december december 16 for colin powell, december 28 for donald rumsfeld, december 22 for john ashcroft. bill clinton didnt name his picks for those positions until at least december 22. george h.w. bush was the fastest off the mark  he named james baker secretary of state the day after the november 8 election. ronald reagan waited until december 11 to get started; jimmy carter waited until december 3. 
were still waiting on trumps state and defense picks, but hes already out of the gate with senator jeff sessions for attorney general. its november 17. 
the media are so eager to bury trumps administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so. instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks  steve bannon, for example, is a rotten pick , but not because hes a racist or anti-semite  the media keep proclaiming the end is near. this sort of alarmism doesnt convince americans, who dont really see why theres any giant rush to appoint people who arent going to be formally considered by the senate until january 20 anyway. 
if this election was about repudiation of the media  and it was  the media arent doing themselves any favors when they promulgate fact-free narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets fake news. for years, americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day. each day, the media seem determined to prove them right. tags",43,736286,real

"obscured american eddie the housepainter eddie and friends 
when 46-year-old eddie found out id been interviewing people, he wanted to talk. you can write a book about me! and thats true enough, but then again, ive never met an uninteresting person. 
within a minute, eddie was showing me photos of women on his cell phone. there was plenty of skin and at least one crotch shot. these voluptuous ladies had sent these boudoir selfies to him, eddie growled, his eyes sparkling. 
eddies a beefy dude, with a head like an olmec statue. though he wears a permanent scowl, its a friendly scowl. 
eddie was in friendly lounge with his housepainting boss, tony, an italian dude who used to live in the neighborhood. 
after talking to eddie, i checked out his facebook page. im a fun loving guy who just wants peace in my life, he introduces himself, and the first two photos feature eddie with white women. in one, hes in some bar and wearing a white t-shirt, white girls love me. with his arms outstretched, eddies surrounded by eight white females and one bald white guy. the women appear to be in their 30s and 40s, though one, wearing granny glasses, has sweated, cursed and imbibed her way through nearly six decades, it seems. you go, grandma! in the other photo, two beaming blondes drape themselves all over eddie. 
below these shots, theres a video of oprah winfrey begging her audience to vote for hillary clinton, and down the page, theres a computer animation of donald trump making his most grotesque faces while sitting on a toilet. 
talking to me, eddie brought up the pains of being rejected by his dad all his life. the rates of american children being born out of wedlock have been rising, calamitously, for decades, and currently stand at around 40. among blacks, its 72. 
ive known tony since high school. he lives in the suburbs too. i grew up in west philly, right around the corner from the zoo, then i moved to the suburbs. ive been working with tony for two years. 
i was in boston for ten years. the only reason i came back here was because i had the cancer and everything. after they did the surgery, my family wanted me to come back, you know, be closer to home, in case it happens again. 
i was doing work. the customers loved the work. their relatives were from boston, and they were like, do you travel? i said, if its worth it, yeah. 
so they put me on a job up there, and my ex-girlfriend, i stayed at her house for a while, then i bought my own place. when i moved up there, i just got work, work, work, work. 
i loved it up there! i loved it! i loved it! i loved it! 
its funny because im not like most black guys, black people, you know. i love the water, being out there on the water, fishing and all types of stuff, and there are so many bodies of water up there. thats where i get my peace of mind, you know what i mean? i sit there and dont have a care in the world. i didnt have my own boat. i was renting the stuff right there. 
here, its not the same because you cant get in the water. i love fresh water. fresh water is beautiful. i like deep sea fishing, salt water and all that, but freshwater is beautiful. 
this whole summer, i didnt hit the water at all. i didnt even swim this summer. did you hear what i just said, tony? this whole summer, i didnt even swim. like, what the fuck! 
they have lakes up there, and they have park rangers and theyve got grills up there, where you can grill, volleyball nets, all that stuff. 
its 4 a car-load, so you can have six people in a car. it only takes 4 to get in there. you can swim, fish, play volleyball, and you can do that almost any time. 
everybody kept telling me that its crazy to move up there, like theyre so prejudiced up there, but theyre not. they were so nice. 
the first day i got up there, people were opening doors for me. they were like, hey, how are you doing?! it was totally different from here, you know, and i loved it, just loved it. 
its not racial at all. there were so many mixed couples, so many brazilians, ecuadorians, all types. puerto ricans, chinese, asians, all, all, everything. 
they did have a bad rap, but its just not correct. 
they do still have certain areas. they still have these little gangs. like, one of my buddies wanted to take me to a club. we get there, and i have to park down the street. they had already gone inside the club, but i had to park. when i got close, walking, two dudes stopped me. there was a black guy and a puerto rican guy. they were like, yo, you got the wrong color on. 
so i opened my mouth, and i said, youve got to be kidding me, and i was laughing. you dont know my lifestyle. youre coming at me like that? 
as soon as i opened my mouth, though, they were like, oh, youre not from around here. where are you from? i said im from philly, so they were like, youre cool, man. i laughed at them, basically. 
there are different levels with me. you get mad, you get angry and you get upset, you know what im saying? i try not to get angry, at all. angry takes me to a totally different place, which is not good, so i try not to do that. i try to stay at one focal point and, even though im mad at you right now, ill still say something stupid so that you laugh. 
lets say youre just bothering me. ill walk outside or something, then come back in, and ill start fucking with you back, but in a fun way. even though you were fucking with me in a bad way, ill come back and fuck with you, in a good way. order it now 
i always try to turn a negative into a positive. 
youre not going to defeat me by your words or whatever, you know, because im very smart. in the 7th grade, i used to smoke weed and stuff like that, came to class all high, and i still got as on my tests. 
they kept me after school, you know, because i was cheating, and i still got the same grade, so they were like, youre so smart to be so dumb. 
my sociology teacher said, you shouldnt be getting high. youre too intelligent for that. it stuck with me all my life. 
like, me and him are facebook friends. i texted him, hey mr. coleman, blah, blah, blah. yo, thank you for saying that to me when i took your class, and he was like, well, eddie, i dont remember what i said. i told him, you said that i was so smart to be so dumb, and i always took that into my brain. 
my kids are mixed. i love white women. ha, ha, ha! 
we all bleed the same damn color. people dont realize that racism is taught. if you take an asian kid, a black kid and a white kid and put them in the sandbox, theyre going to play, until somebody say they cant play with that child. 
its the parents. the parents may come up to that kid, get out of there! you cant play with them! you know what i mean? the kids will act how kids act. they dont know no better. theyll play! 
me, i have no problems at all. you respect me, i respect you. 
like i said, i have mixed kids, but growing up, i was shot at because i was black. i walked through the wrong neighborhood. somebody tried to shoot me with a harpoon! ive been through some shit. i cant help it if im black. i cant help that. 
thats what he does, you know, scuba diving. he didnt hit me. i was lucky i got pushed out of the way. this was growing up in the suburbs, lansdowne, yeadon, upper darby. i got shot at, you know what i mean, because i walked on the sidewalk. 
cops in darby, they beat me up. it was a domestic call. my wife was white, ok? we had kids, mixed kids. the argument was next door, not my house, but they came at my house, threw me down the steps, beat me up, put me in a cop car, then turned around and told me, if you dont want to go to the hospital, you better give me your address, so i gave them my address. 
they were like, you dont live there. a white girl lives there. they were like, where you live at? i gave them the address again. they were like, you dont live there! you go to the hospital, so guess what? i went to the hospital. they beat me the fuck up! 
they took me from my house. she was living there, with me! 
i couldnt even fight back. my wife said, thats my husband, but they made her go back in the house. this was 92. 
i came home the next day. they ripped my shirt. i had a button shirt. they cut it in the back, with a razor, so im walking in my shirt with a hole in it. they made me walk home without no shoes. 
so i went to my old neighborhood. i talked to my mom and all that, and we went to the lansdowne police station, because we knew an officer there. they said there was nothing they could do about it, because theres a code of silence among the police officers, or so they said, so my sister took it to a different level. 
i dont know if youve ever heard of mary mason? what? my sister took it to a radio station. they had a picture of me. they had a picture of my clothes. they had a picture of me all beat up and everything. 
over nothing! over nothing! literally. i was beaten up over nothing! 
i ended up suing them but, again, i was young, so i settled out of court with them. i ended up getting, like, 45,000. if i kept it going, i would have gotten a whole lot more. 
like i said, again, then i was selling drugs. i had an arsenal. i had guns and stuff like that, you know. i was going to blow the police station the fuck up, you know what i mean, but the police station was right next to a school, so i couldnt do that. 
no, i didnt have a record then. i never got caught. 
they were arguing next door. it wasnt us! they went to the wrong house and fucked me up! 
ive got three friends that are police officers. i trust them, but i dont trust those other ones. as soon as i saw them, its, yes, sir, whatever, but they threw me to the ground and worked me over! 
for two years, they harassed me. they banned me from that town. if they saw me driving, theyd pull me over. they were like, youve got two minutes to get out of this town! 
i had to move back to my mom for a little while. my wife and kids, too. 
i never got bitter over that. i get sick of reading stuff now in the news. i think about my childrens security. it pisses me off, you know. 
like i said, again, i already lived that life. innocent people getting beaten up by the cops, getting killed, that could have been me, i could have gotten killed. that night. 
what i was doing was, i was avoiding that act, you know, which was kind of hard to do, because certain roads led that way, so i had to take back streets just to keep away. again, i was still young too. 
i was going to blow the hell out of that police station, you know what i mean? i had the artillery to do it, but, again, glory to god and all that. god had my back! otherwise, that police station and whoever was in it was gone! order it now 
theres a kid that i went to school with, they killed him in a cell. now, when they put you in that cell, they take your shoe strings, they take your belt and they take your shirt from you, so how are you going to hang yourself? hes 6-4. how do you hang yourself when youre 6-4 and youre in a 6-foot cell? you cant! 
he was a good kid, but he was a bad kid, you know what i mean? i forget how he got locked up. he got locked up for something. they killed him the same night. they locked him up, then they killed him. you can look it up. its on the internet still. 
my wife stayed with me. five years later, we split up, but it wasnt over that. i had three children with her, my oldest three. 
she got mad because i moved on. i had another woman. i was just having another kid. i had a reason to dump her, you know what i mean? if youre in a relationship, and youre not growing. youre supposed to grow together. she cheated on me. im sure she did. she got caught twice, so when she started doing it, i started doing it. 
she did it first, she did it first, she started it. 
all i did was work. i worked, then came home, i swear to god! i was bringing home 1,300 cash a week. i was taking out vent systems, heaters, boilers and all that. i was bringing all this money home. its heavy work, back-breaking stuff. all you wanted to do was go home to your shower and thats it. eat, then sleep. 
i was mad because she was collecting welfare. its like, why are you collecting welfare? weve got plenty of money. we had a good life. its because of her girlfriends. it was like, you can get this, you get that. now, i had no insurance and stuff. i told her, you can get the medical, and you can get the food stamps, but dont get the cash, but she went out and got it all. she got all the benefits, so i ended up in the system. 
i told the judge, how are you locking me up, when my kids live with me? like, what are you talking about? this is my house. my kids live with me and everything. well, it was because of her, she was getting welfare, but i didnt know. 
i was getting locked up for a month here, a month there, you know. when they locked you up in the state of pennsylvania, they suspended your license, so how could you get to work? if you had a driving job, you couldnt do it. its fucked up! 
i told the judge, again, here you go, my kids live with me. i dont owe her nothing. why am i here? if you look at the record, youll understand what im talking about here. im confused. you guys locked me up, like, six fuckin times, so he said, maam, why is he here? 
oh, im trying to get more money, blah, blah, blah blah, so he looked and found out that she had a warrant out, so he said to me, mr. calvin, you want me to lock her up? what shes doing is welfare fraud. 
i said, your honor, no. i said no. were not together no more. i didnt suffer from you guys. i was in the system. i was in jail six times, but im done now. i said, no, thats my kids mother. dont lock her up. 
he went to her, and he said, maam, this is a hell of a nice guy. why did you do this to him? she had no answer. 
she was acting real stupid. i looked at her and i said, i told you you wasnt going to get no money. thats what i said to her. i told you you werent going to get no money. the judge could have locked you up, no matter what i said. you heard what he said. it was welfare fraud. youre stupid for even bringing me in here. 
i had three kids with her, my oldest three. 
i have a kid thats getting ready to turn four, up in boston. all of my other kids are here. ive got 24, 21, 20, 16, 15 and one thats getting ready to turn four. i grew up without a father, so i was going to make sure im not going to be like my father, you know what i mean? 
my three oldest, i put money into their accounts, in their names. they each have 50,000 in their bank account, right now. theyve got more money than i do. now, my younger ones, my 16 and 15-year-old, theyve got about 10,000. the baby dont have shit, you know what i mean, but shes going to get hers. 
i was doing the smart thing with the money. like i said, i grew up without a father, so im going to provide for my kids, no matter what. ill suffer later, but as long as my kids are ok, then im happy. 
when i did get to know my father, i met him in church. i was 16 years old when i got to meet my father. i went to church with my mom. 
i was 16. again, i was selling drugs, but i was also working at mcdonalds and going to school. 
he comes into church, sits behind us and goes like this to my mom. taps on her shoulder, whos that? she almost cursed in church. its a shame you dont know your own son! i turned around and almost flipped, but then i realized i was in church. i was like, you made me and you dont know who i am?! 
when she got pregnant by him, she was with him for, like, five years. she said, im pregnant, and the next day, he was gone. my father did this to five other women, the same exact thing, because i have five brothers. he did the same thing to each one of the women. 
my father, i almost killed him, in church. i was so angry. yeaah. yeaah. i was like, how can you not know who i am? where was you at? like, why dont you want me? what did i do to you? i didnt do anything to you. you made me, but there was nothing, not a fuckin word, not a fuckin word. order it now 
i never called him dad. i never called him pop. there was nothing until i turned 18. when we graduated high school, i paid for his parking to come see me graduate. thats fucked up. 
now, my grandfather and grandma loved the shit out of me. i knew them. i knew them since i was three! 
my grandparents, they loved me. they knew who i was. my grandpop and grandmom used to always brag about me when i walked down the street, when i walked by the house, everything like that. theyd say, there goes my grandson. they would tell people, theres my grandson. 
my father came to my graduation because i begged him to come. face to face, i was like, im your son. arent you proud of me for graduating, at least? he was like, well, she has money. 
i paid for his parking. i paid for his ticket. we got, like, three graduation tickets, and you had to pay for two more. i paid for it. i paid for him. it was 10 or something. he didnt want to pay 10 to see his son graduate. 
thats why i made a promise to myself. i said that when i have kids, no matter what happens between me and the girl, my kids are going to know who i am, and that i was there, so thats what ive done. 
tony gets mad that a lot of his crew dont have cars and stuff, but when my son, my first born, made me a grandpa, i gave him my truck. 
i know what its like to be on a bus with kids, grocery shopping and all that, with the kid wrapped around you, and you carrying bags and getting on a bus. i know what its like, so i gave him my truck. 
i told tony, i aint got no vehicle, man. i gave it to my son. i aint got no car! but it made me feel good, because i would never be like my father. never! 
when i hear people, because i hear people all the time, like how they hate their mom, how they hate their dad, and im like, i can see how you hate your dad, and you must have a reason, but at least youre living together. i didnt have that. all i had was my mom. youve got a mom and a dad, so you should be happy, youre lucky, because i didnt have that.

fox news is busy feeding their viewers the dream of a trump comeback, but thats to be expected. 
fox news is the channel that brought you dick morris predicting mitt romneys victory and karl roves election night flip out over obamas win in 2012. 
one of the sure signs that a voters are close to a definitive outcome in a presidential election is when some in the media start trying to gin up a comeback for the trailing candidate. with the exception of fox news and other conservative outlets, media like cnn go down this path because they see interest waning in the election, so they are looking to boost ratings with some artificial drama. 
like clockwork, some in the press are cooking up the comeback kid narrative. 
dont fall for it. trust numbers. trust facts, and trust voting results. the rest of it is the standard nonsense that gets pulled every election year when the networks begin to see their election bounce end and ratings decline.",133,736264,real

"defense secretary halts forced repayment of enlistment bonuses email 
responding to a chorus of protests and complaints, defense secretary ash carter has suspended collection of repayments of enlistment bonuses made to members of the california national guard. carter has also directed that a review be made of the process that led to members of the california guard being given bonuses to reenlist, only to have the department of defense demand repayment of the bonuses. 
carter called the process unfair to service members and to taxpayers, and said he has ordered the defense finance and accounting service to suspend all efforts to collect reimbursement from affected california national guard members, effective as soon as is practical. 
this suspension, carter added, will continue until i am satisfied that our process is working effectively. 
im glad the pentagon came to its senses, house speaker paul ryan said, in response to carters statement. congress will continue to work on any reforms necessary to ensure this doesnt happen again. 
jeff miller, a florida republican, and chairman of the house veterans affairs committee, was not as charitable as ryan, however. he denounced carters response as weak and ham-handed, pointing out that the moratorium will not cover potential problems outside california. 
miller added, carter seems to have no plan to make those whove already been forced to pay back their bonuses whole, and by focusing only on the california guard, he is ignoring what media reports indicate could be a national problem. once again, it seems congress will be forced to fix a problem that the obama administration created but refuses to fully address on its own. 
during the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan, the california national guard offered soldiers thousands of dollars in bonuses to entice them to re-enlist. it was at a time when the military was having difficulty meeting its recruiting goals. it is estimated that the bonuses were given to almost 10,000 soldiers, in amounts of 15,000, or even more. 
david cloud of the los angeles times explained the problem to national public radio npr. the bonuses were paid to encourage soldiers to sign up for another tour in the army, generally for an additional six years. they were being paid at a time when the california guard desperately needed soldiers to fill the ranks of units going to iraq. so they were more generous than usual. 
unfortunately, many soldiers given bonuses did not qualify under the rules used at the time. then, many years later, the pentagon conducted audits and demanded the soldiers who received the payments pay them back  with interest. 
this story has made my blood boil, said bill hahn, vice president for communications with the john birch society parent organization of the new american magazine, making specific reference to a woman  a master sergeant  who went to afghanistan after getting a 15,000 bonus. susan haleys entire family served in the army, and she had served 26 years in the military herself. after all of that, she received notice  while caring for her son, another soldier who had lost his leg in afghanistan  that she owed thousands of dollars to the pentagon. 
i feel totally betrayed, said sergeant haley, a native of los angeles. haley is presently sending the pentagon 650 each month  a quarter of her familys income. haley is worried that she will have to sell their home to repay the bonuses. theyll get their money, but i want those years back, haley said, referring to the additional six years she spent in the military as a consequence of the bonus she is now forced to repay. 
a former army captain, christopher van meter, expressed similar sentiments people like me just got screwed. these bonuses were used to keep people in. van meter has been forced to refinance his home mortgage to pay the 25,000 in re-enlistment bonuses the army insists he should not have received. during the extra time he spent in the service, he was thrown from an armored vehicle turret, after the vehicle detonated a buried roadside bomb. he received a purple heart for his injuries. 
robert richmond, an army sergeant, re-enlisted for 15,000 as a special forces soldier. in 2007, his company was deployed to hillah, an iraqi town 60 miles south of baghdad. in this area  known as the triangle of death  a roadside bomb exploded, leaving him with permanent injuries to his back and his brain. 
with the 15,000 unpaid debt on his credit report, he was turned down for a home loan in texas. 
the army began to experience recruiting shortfalls during the second bush administration and the two wars in afghanistan and iraq, forcing the pentagon to resort to the most generous re-enlistment incentives in history. the recruiting and re-enlistment difficulties have continued into the obama administration, causing some to address causes for the problem, and others to offer solutions. 
national guard units, such as those in california, have been activated more and more frequently in recent years, as the pentagon has faced difficulty raising enough troops in the regular army to handle the frequent overseas deployments in the administrations of george h.w. bush, bill clinton, george w. bush, and barack obama. this in turn has led to more difficulty in filling the ranks of the various state units of the national guard across the country. 
the wars in iraq and afghanistan are obvious reasons for the reluctance of many to join the national armed forces or the national guard units. but with the increasing political correctness of the armed forces with training in such morale-damaging classes as white privilege, the inclusion of women in combat roles and the lowering of physical standards to accommodate them, the push to allow for homosexual, bisexual, and transgendered soldiers, and the like thousands more soldiers have opted for a different career. 
with difficulties in raising enough soldiers through recruitment, some have advocated a return to the military draft. the draft ended in 1973, but at the urging of president jimmy carter, draft registration was reinstated in 1980. this became a minor issue in the presidential campaign of 1980, with governor ronald reagan speaking out in opposition to draft registration. since that time, there has been insufficient national support for reinstating the draft. but with the decline in recruitment, supporters of the draft have blamed the all-volunteer force. 
if the country were to return to the draft, the question of whether women should be included in any conscription law would be raised. recently, the u.s. senate voted to include women in draft registration, but the republican-led house of representatives balked, narrowly defeating the effort by 217-203. 
presently, men must sign up for the draft within 30 days of turning 18. but with falling numbers of young men willing to join todays military forces, for whatever reason, expect increasing pressure to add women to the draft registration rolls. 
in 1940, on the eve of a presidential election, president franklin d. roosevelt famously said, i say to you again, and again, and again  your sons will never be sent to fight in a foreign war. with the inclusion of young women in both the draft and combat, perhaps this should be updated to your sons and your daughters will never be sent to fight in a foreign war  but if they are, expect us to ask for their bonuses back.",187,736269,fake
"hannity fbi knows they are about to be exposed by wikileaks  endingfed news network email print sean hannity said on his radio show friday that he doesnt believe reports from the new york times that the fbis latest investigation into the clinton foundation is related to huma abedin and anthony weiner. instead, hannity suspects that the fbi is protecting itself because they know that wikileaks is about to drop proof that hillary clinton should have been indicted in july. 
sean hannity if you believe the new york times, they have a new story that just broke. new emails in clinton case came from anthony weiners electronic devices. federal law enforcement officials said friday that new emails uncovered in closed investigation into hillary clintons use of a private email server discovered after the fbi seized electronic devices belonging to huma abedin, and aide to mrs. clinton, and her husband anthony weiner. the fbi told congress that uncovered new emails. 
let me tell you how. i am going to say something that i know is true. this story is total bull. i dont believe this for a minute. hannity, its the new york times. i have no doubt the new york times got on-the-record leaks that this is related to anthony weiner and huma abedins emails. i have no doubt  maybe huma didnt take a sledgehammer to her devices the way hillary clinton did. but this is not what resulted in the reopening of this case. no way, shape, manner, or form. they know julian assange  theres too much in wikileaks that is coming, that has tipped them off that theyre dead. that theyre about to be exposed. and that is, more than anything else, this is about preservation now. 
because james comey, and and now we get back to this this sky andrew mccabe who was the fbi deputy director supervising the investigation of clinton not long after terry mcauliffe through a pac gave 675,000 dollars to jo mccabe, the wife of the chief the fbi deputy director looking into the investigation into clinton for a long shot bid, and that 675,000 came from hillary, who went out there and raise money for the super pacs that mcauliffe coudl give it to her. 
the wife of the guy doing the key investigation here. now if that doesnt impress you, i dont know what does.. 
now lets go back to trey gowdy grilling james comey. what did he say? 
secretary clinton said she never sent or received classified information over a private email server, is that true? comey our investigation found there was classified information sent. 
stop right there. comey is admitting a crime is committed. that raises the question why did comey then make a determination on his own not to send this to or grand jury or special prosecutor or anybody else? in other words, the statute requires, she doesnt even have to be negligent. im sorry the statute requires negligence or gross negligence, yet hillary was knowingly, purposefully, and wikileaks proves this, in her decisions and actions setting up a server under her control. 
heres the question comey has to ask why did you give all these people immunity?why did you destroy evidence in the case as part of a proffered deal, why in under any circumstances do you close this case down when the evidence was overwhelming and incontrovertible and had sent numerous other people to jail for a far lesser offenses? thats called a two-tiered justice system, thats a problem 
hillary knowingly and purposely hurt decisions and actions set up a server under her exclusive control and possession in order to control violate the law in ordered to control information that was available to the american public and congress regarding actions as secretary of state. 
furthermore, she took those government-owned communications into our own personal possession after leaving her position, knowingly and willingly attempted to destroy them, by the way thats obstruction of justice, violation of the law, penalty of which a minor offenses you never get a government position for the rest of your life. and was so nefarious in her actions, could never be known used as evidence 
this gets more curious day by day. now there were reports out today that fbi agents were reportedly close to revolting over the treatment of clinton, theyre so disgusted, and every fbi special agent i know  nobody has a good answer because they dont understand why organizes pretty deep 
new emails tied to discovered i dont believe the new york times, and i think the the fbi did this because they know what is coming. thats my take. stay connected by subscribing to our news letter. click on the button.",59,736269,fake

"obama men who dont vote clinton are sexist! 0 comments 
incredible. just when you start to think that there is nothing more obama could say to become more a dirt bag than hes already proven himself to be, he goes and pulls something off the charts stupid! 
in his efforts to push hillary into the white house he spoke at a recent rally for her. what he had to say, was an insult to american men. 
see for yourself! 
he says he wants to be honest? he lacks the integrity to do so. so basically when men dont vote for hillary, its not because they are intelligent enough to recognize she is a corrupt snake whose greed and hunger for money and power will leave our country hanging by a string. its not because they have a mind to think for themselves and decide whether shes the person for the job or not. 
nopeaccording to obama, its because american men are racist. 
infuriating..isnt it? 
its just too much stupid, and we all know we shouldnt engage with it because it will drag us down to its level and destroy us with experience in stupiditybut still.

normal people cant just make this stuff upbut who said netanyahu is normal? in a story in todays israel national news, netanyahu claims he was forced to abort a planned tactical nuclear attack on iran. according to a series of sources, a newspaper in kuwait, a news service in bethlehem and the ever faithful israel national news, it is all true. israels slated 2014 nuclear attack on iran, to be launched from azerbaijan using nuclear weapons landed at poti, georgia in 2010, was averted due to threats of us reprisals against israel. despite continual denials by azerbaijan, israel has maintained, not only nuclear armed f15s in azerbaijan but a drone base as well. 
sources in the ukraine indicate that combat aircraft from one of israels two covert bases in western azerbaijan was in the vicinity of malaysian airlines flight mh17 when it was shot down last year.

"yes, the religious right warns witchcraft could decide this election by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat, oct 29th, 2016 at 841 pm ""that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released""   
coming from people who believe in something called spiritual warfare a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions  it is perhaps no surprise that the religious right should declare that their messiah  donald trump  is being threatened with witchcraft. 
lance wallnau, whose twitter page claims to be your spiritual warfare guide to the 2016 election, appeared on the jim bakker show to push the crazy idea that many christians feel this fog on their head at times and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released. 
watch courtesy of right wing watch 
oh sweet baby jesus, the mighty lance has struck out. what has happened, of course, is that the religious right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion. its no wonder they feel in a fog . metaphorically or physically, theyre selling their souls. 
wallnau claims the left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of christ who doesnt work together, and thats the dilemma that americas in right now, even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the religious right has been organizing since goldwater lost in 64 . 
a hypocrite just cant catch a break, it seems 
the web literally is coming down on america. and whats sad is, how many christians feel this fog on their head at times? do you feel that? its almost like everythings going wrong. we dont realize its a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the american culture and discipling the country. and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released. 
wherever theres agreement, theres power. the more unbelievers agree with the narrative that theyre hearing, the more power and authorization satan has to manifest. so unless the church has an exposure of what the enemys doing and begins to agree together with a counter-strategy, were going to deal with more and more fog. and the worst part iswe dont have to surrender nations to the devil. 
so if you disagree with wallnau, if you oppose trump, it can only because youre manifesting the power of satan who in the old testament is gods lieutenant, not his adversary. so pick your testament, i suppose. 
lance wallnau insists he is not a big conspiracy theorist buff, but this doesnt do anything to convince us hes not some wack-a-doodle instead. this is nothing new, as a non-christian being told that you represent a devil you dont even believe exists. 
there are 2,000 years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize or worse their opponents. 
without charges of satanism and witchcraft, you dont have the genocide of european and middle eastern paganism; you dont have anti-jewish pogroms; and you dont have the crusades or the spanish inquisition; you dont have witch-burnings. 
what this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that were not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents. 
not only do they deal in a conspiracy-laden world, a world free of facts, but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason  and lets go ahead and say sanity  do not. 
lets face it donald trumps biggest enemy is not satan, but donald trump himself. and wallnau can claim believers have an edge all they want, but all the belief in the world wont overturn reality.",133,736267,real
"trump unveiled reveals the big con of donald trumps presidential run trump unveiled reveals the big con of donald trumps presidential run posted on nov 1, 2016 
by john k. wilson  or books  
editors note the following is an excerpt from trump unveiled exposing the bigoted billionaire, by john k. wilson. trump unveiled is published by or books. click here for details. 
with his casino background, trump is an expert at attracting gamblers, people who are willing to throw the dice with the irrational hope it will make their lives better. trump understands how to recruit gamblersby evoking hope and concealing facts. a casino doesnt tell you that youre likely to lose; a casino tells you that anything can happen, and you might just win, and what the hell, youll have some fun along the way. thats the appeal of trumps campaign take a chance on me, and ill give you everything. 
in fact, trump literally promised everything to his followers. trump promised workers in michigan, ill get you a new job; dont worry about it. if the cost of supporting trump is so small a mere vote and the potential economic benefits are so great a new job, economic prosperity, and global dominance, why not go for trump? trump is the cheapest lottery ticket youll ever buy. and even if the odds that hell keep his word are very small, why not take a gamble on trump? 
this explains why trump is so committed to denouncing america. he claims despite all the evidence to the contrary that the economy is a disaster, that the unemployment rate is really 42 percent, that everything is terrible, and that only he can make america great again. if youre trying to recruit a gambler, you need to make them feel like normal life is boring and miserable. trump tells america that their lives are horrible, and even though its factually not true for the overwhelming majority, they begin to wonder if he might be right. everyone can imagine being richer and happier, and thats precisely the core appeal of gambling. 
as trump the real estate developer put it i play to peoples fantasies. ... the more unattainable the apartments seemed, the more people wanted them. trump is applying the same principles to politics trump is presenting a fantasy of what people want from a president, and the more unattainable and unrealistic his promises are, the more people will want him even if they know they are being irrational. 
trumps own lavish lifestyle serves his message. trump loves to have rallies at airport hangers; its not just the convenience of flying in and out quickly. the true appeal of it to trump is that it reminds his audience how incredibly wealthy he is he has a giant plane with his name on it. trump is telling supporters, ive got a plane. do you? vote for me, and who knows, maybe you will. might trumps ostentatious display of extreme wealth turn off potential voters who are angry at financial inequality and the rigged system that favors the rich? the opposite is true trump is telling them the system is rigged and theyre right to be angry at the rich, but trump is the only one who can offer the salvation of getting rich yourself. trump university was another form of shafting suckers gambling on trump. give trump thousands of dollars to learn his secrets, and maybe, just maybe, youll get really rich, too. 
trump also understands that the best way to bring people to a casino is with a distraction, and the best kind of distraction is a fight. a big boxing match attracts crowds who stick around to toss some coin at the casino. and so trump is always provoking fights with his opponents, with protesters, with the media, with twitter critics, with anyone and everyone who irritates him. distraction is essential to any casino. you want bright lights and noisy machines, free drinks and sexy waitresses. you want fancy palaces with shimmering chandeliers. you want the customer paying attention to everything except the fact that its all a giant, flashy scam. as the slogan of the trump taj mahal says, excitement returns. distractions make people more willing to gamble. in an environment of calm analysis, rational thinking tends to prevail. 
trump explained his approach to the apprentice i rant and rave like a lunatic and the crazier i am, the higher the ratings. this is also trumps approach to his presidential campaign, because it is his way of life. 
casinos are a legal con. the gamblers always lose, collectively, and everyone knows that. but individuals can sometimes win. the key for any casino is to convince gamblers to imagine that they will be the exception to the odds. they dont even have to believe something so irrational is likely, they just have to hope. 
trump is gambling on the idea that he can convince the voters that the world they live in is a rigged game. they keep trying to play fair, and they get screwed. trump is promising to play this rigged game, but says he will rig it on behalf of america. nobody thinks trump is an honest person; but the more he lies, the more his supporters can imagine that hes going to lie for us. hes going to be a lying son of a bitch, but he will be our lying son of a bitch. hes a con man working for us to take the rest of the worlds money after they stole it from us. 
the trick of trumps con is that he implicitly admits to being a con man. trumps book, the art of the deal, could easily have been titled the art of the con. the book is full of examples of how trump misleads truthful hyperbole and manipulates people to take advantage of them. trump has bragged, ive taken advantage of the banks probably more than any other human being on earth. to trump, conning people is a credential. 
as a con artist, trump believes in nothing but himself. only a con artist could propose the largest tax increase on the wealthy in human history just a few years ago and now propose the largest tax cut on the wealthy in human history while simultaneously claiming that hes going to make the rich pay more. trump will say anything to get elected. 
trump has only a few consistent positions he has held for decades. because trump is a con artist, he will never believe in free trade. the concept of mutually beneficial agreements is alien to him; someone is always taking advantage of someone else in trumps world. youre either the con artist or the victim. 
the fact that trump is a con artist does not mean he is plotting as president to steal a trillion dollars and run off to a remote island. trump, after all, is a narcissist who dreams of being president and imagines himself the greatest leader in history. but trump can never escape his con artist instincts. he is unable to change, and incapable of self-criticism. he will govern as a con artist, as someone who deceives and manipulates and seeks to control everything around him. as a con artist, trump imagines that everyone is organizing a con as well, which leads to his conspiratorial thinking. only the naïve fail to understand theyre the victim of a con. 
casting a vote is as easy as buying a lottery ticket, and its free, too. why not take a chance that trump can deliver what he says, even if you know he cant? the odds are against you, but hope matters more than probabilities. as the powerball ad slogan says, anythings possible. 
trump once said, my life is like a game of poker. as a gambler, trump knows how to take risks with other peoples money. but he shows a dangerous tendency to follow instinct rather than reason. the only hope for trump to emerge victorious is if he can convince the american people to be the same kind of gambler he has been. 
donald trump is a pathological liar, a sexist pig, a hateful racist, a corrupt businessman, a pandering populist, a conspiracy nut, and a vicious bully. trumps cynical narcissism explains why he wants to be president, but his political success reflects much deeper problems in america the inequality of wealth that makes a man like trump so powerful, the celebrity-obsessed media that gave trump an uncritical platform for his ideas, and the failure of our political system to address americas flaws, which has allowed a bigoted demagogue to seize control of the republican party.",207,736269,fake

"snowflake colbert didnt want to write jokes about trump winning  daily wire snowflake colbert didnt want to write jokes about trump winning by hank berrien november 21, 2016 
conversing with fellow daily show comic john oliver at the montclair film festival on saturday night, late show unfunny host stephen colbert admitted that he couldnt even conceive that donald trump would win the presidency; so much so that he couldnt write jokes bout trump winning for election night. 
in the roughly two-hour discussion and qa titled wow, that was weird, montclair film festival executive director tom hall set the somber tone by allowing, ""when we planned this evening, i think we all thought we'd be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face."" 
speaking of the late show s election night special on showtime, colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired 
there was not a bear big enough in the world that we weren't loaded for. we were so loaded for every possible eventuality. we had so many guests. we had so many pre-taped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. we had three shows hillary clinton wins and we know; hillary clinton wins and we dont know, because its not called before the shows over; donald trump's going to win and we dont know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. that's not wishful thinking, that's what everyone was saying. 
and then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is donald trump is going to win and we know he's going to win. my execs and my writers were like, you don't want to write something for that? and i'm like, no! there is nothing you can write. you don't understand. i have 400 people in my theater. if we know donald trump is going to win, it's going to be like doing stand-up comedy for one of those chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. there will be no laughter! we only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, f it, it's going to be him, let's just talk for another hour. so i think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. 
colbert moaned that the special was ""the hardest thing i've ever done in my life,"" adding, ""i was tying my tie at 1030 and i went, 'oh, he took ohio. oh, well, we expected that. he took it by 11 points. wow! that's not expected.' and then over my guests' shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, 'florida, iowa, nebraska.'"" he revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but ""none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. our audience was sobbing openly. and those are people who work for me, like my cameramen."" 
as daily wire editor-in-chief ben shapiro pointed out years ago , colbert's manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives 
he engages in conservativeface. he needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative  after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. instead, he acts as though he is a conservative  an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. he out-archie bunkers archie bunker. his audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious colbert who wishes to persecute gays; they chortle at evil sexist colbert who thinks men are victims of sexism. this is the purpose of colberts routine. his show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. in order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks; in the same way, colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. 
on saturday night, colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a trump presidency, arguing, ""im all for giving him a chance, but dont give him an inch. because i believed everything he said, and i remember everything he said. and its horrifying. it's possible. the job changes a man. that's the cliche of the presidency."" he pontificated 
every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, well, there are levers of power in washington that can slow him down. but two things one is they're cowards. second is that the levers in washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. because they tried to stop trump. everybody tried to stop trump, do not delude yourself. 
everyone except the people he's going to appoint tried to stop him and they didn't. he owes them nothing. he goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, shall i do it? and they say, 'yes. and he says, it shall be so. and the balcony is twitter. he goes onto twitter and he goes, what do you think? do you think i'm right? that's what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn't. and he's a vindictive person. so it's all going to be fine. merry christmas. no! there is nothing you can write."" stephen colbert 
colbert concluded, ""the next person who says to me, 'you must be happy on a certain level, is going to have their eye carved out. 
so thats the man underneath the comedy mask . . .",43,736289,real

i mean frankly i spend most of my time overseeing the trump event rallies, i mean thats what i do for the clinton campaign, creamer states. 
in previous video releases from veritas, democratic operatives reveal how they had been working to incite violence at trump rallies, using a tactic called bird-dogging. an operative also reveals to the undercover journalists their step-by-step voter fraud strategy. 
the clinton campaign originally denied working with creamer and his firm, democracy partners. okeefe then released a video of creamer stating that their donald ducks effort was at the request of the candidate herself. 
every morning i am on a call at 1030 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters  i am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising, creamer says in the latest video. 
he also admits to working directly with barack obama, statements that are backed up by his 340 logged visits to the white house  where he met with obama 45 times. 
i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. i mean, for immigration reform for the the health care bill, for trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues. 
to gain access and trust, okeefe reveals that he had provided a 20,000 donation to the americans for united for change super pac from belize. 
the more money that was promised to creamer, the more access project veritas action journalists seemed to get, project veritas said in their release .
following the release of the first veritas videos last week, the pac suddenly returned the donation  stating that they were concerned it may have been illegal. 
in an unexpected twist, aufc president brad woodhouse, the recipient of the 20,000, heard that project veritas action was releasing undercover videos exposing aufcs activities. he told a journalist that aufc was going to return the twenty thousand dollars, project veritas explained.  he said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. project veritas action was pleased but wondered why that hadnt been a problem for the month that they had the money. 
okeefe has filed a formal complaint with the federal election commission against both clintons campaign and the democratic national committee based upon the shocking revelations that his team has uncovered. 
during a rally in gettysburg on saturday, trump promised that he would also be suing the dnc for inciting violence at his rallies, based on what he saw in the project veritas videos.

the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. the director himself has said he doesnt know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not, the democratic nominee said. 
thats why its incumbent on the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about, clinton said. 
clinton pushed for more information to be released without delay. she said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasnt given advance notice. clinton said she had not been contacted by comey on this issue. 
when asked what she would tell voters about her emails, clinton responded, i think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails. 
this might be the right place to mention the 22 million emails the bush administration lost and the private rnc servers they used, as context for how important this issue really is to republicans as a value. 
kristen welker asked if clinton was afraid that this could sink her campaign, to which secretary clinton responded with a big laugh ""are you worried this could sink your campaign, secretary clinton,"" a reporter shouts as hrc walks out. clinton only lets out a big laugh.

the republican fbi director james comey wrote the house on friday to inform hopeful republicans that they had found new emails relating to clintons private email that begged further investigation. 
it turns out the emails didnt come from clintons server and there doesnt seem to be any there there, except for giving republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote. 
federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act, and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against comey . 
hillary clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point. how many years on is this? republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long its doa. the press has followed republicans lead with the absurd email story- a story as ridiculous as it is common, and a story that was never a story until clinton did it. 
republicans and some in the press think this might sink the clinton campaign. so they think america would rather put putins puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the white house than someone whose emails weve all read now and found nothing much but gossip. 
yeah, i dont think so.

"the real reason why the clinton email scandal is back has nothing to do with helping trump by jason easley on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 636 pm the reason why the clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with trump's doa white house bid, and everything to do with helping republicans keep control of congress. share on twitter print this post 
the reason why the clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with trumps doa white house bid, and everything to do with helping republicans keep control of congress. 
on the surface, the sudden revival of hillary clintons emails looks like an october surprise designed to help republican nominee donald trump. the problem with this theory is that both democrats and republicans acknowledge that trump is toast. 
unless hillary clintons emails say, lol. i was the shooter on the grassy knoll, there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election. in fact, the emails fbi director was investigating did not come from clinton or her server. they seem to have very little to do with hillary clinton or her presidential campaign. 
the emails are like catnip to republican voters, who have been promised for years that if they keep sending republicans to congress, theyll bring down a democratic president, and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival. 
for the next ten days, republican congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating hillary clinton. the republican candidates can pretend like trump doesnt exist because their new pitch to voters is, vote for me and ill bring down hillary. 
donald trump is a lost cause. millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states. trump is being out organized and trounced by clinton on the ground. 
to understand the real value of the email scandal to the republican party, look down the ballot. 
the hillary clinton email scandal is nothing more republican get out the vote operation to save their majorities in congress.",133,736266,real
"guy fawkes, the gun powder plot  how false flags have shaped history we are change 

 
remember, remember, the 5th of november, 
gunpowder, treason and plot. 
i see no reason why the gunpowder treason 
should ever be forgot. 
-old english folk rhyme anonymous
by barrie zwicker special thanks to truth and shadows 
today, november 5 th , is guy fawkes day, also known as gunpowder day. in 2016 its the 411 th anniversary of the gunpowder plot or gunpowder treason, as it was first called.
it also happens to be my 78 th birthday. so ive been more aware of guy fawkes day than most. im especially happy about how ubiquitous the guy fawkes mask has become. 
the mask was hugely popularized in the movie v for vendetta . as stalwart 911truther kevin barrett wrote, a year ago, in a piece entitled  unmasking media lies why bbcs v-for-vendetta mask piece is fawked up 
v for vendetta may be the most revolutionary film ever made. its obvious message is lets get out there and visit some rough justice on the treasonous bastards who created the 911 and 77 media spectaculars, and destroyed the freedoms for which weve been fighting for centuries. 
watch on youtube v for 911 vendetta past, present and future 
it is also possible to read the film from an interior, psychological perspective rather than just a call to action, its about the psychological process of coming to terms with the 911 and 77 inside jobs, by allowing oneself to feel the overwhelming anger that is the natural response. once one has faced the facts, overcome fear, and come to terms with ones own righteous anger, then its time for revolution. 
the real message of the v mask is simple we know you bastards blew up the trade center. we know youre blowing up the economy. we know youre lying to us 247365. we know youre trying to keep us poor and weak and fearful and impotent. well, guess what? were not afraid of you. were not afraid to die. and were coming to get you. 
no wonder the bbc is afraid to admit what the v mask really means. 
yet for the first 71 years of my life i had entirely the wrong idea about the gunpowder plot what happened, who was really behind it, and its impact on history. an impact that continues to this day. it was in 2005 that i read i read webster tarpleys superb book 911 synthetic terror made in usa right after it came off the press. he introduced me to the historical element.
true, the brazen events of 911 and the mind-boggling cover-up that followed opened my eyes to state-executed terror frauds and the power they deliver to the dark forces that order them. but i didnt know from nuthin about the gunpowder plot.
nor at that time did i appreciate that it and 911 are but two examples from thousands of false flag operations that have changed history.
false flag ops are the least-recognized, highest-impact category of human deceit. in terms of emotional wallop, even the most brilliant lies perpetrated by the most talented demagogues pale, in comparison to a big false flag op, for the power to manipulate the public. on this anniversary lets look more closely at this particular false flag op for some lessons. as william faulkner put it in his requiem for a nun  the past is never dead. its not even past. then we will touch briefly on one of the most recent false flag ops  a leading edge digital one that perversely misappropriates the fawkes name.
 
on the throne of england in 1605 sits james the first, a protestant, the king who ordered the translation of the christian bible that bears his name.
as midnight approaches on november the 4th  the eve of the traditional opening of parliament  armed agents of the king raid a basement room of the houses of parliament. they discover and apprehend one guy fawkes. his age, 36, coincides with the number of barrels of gunpowder they find with him. they find a tunnel leading to the room. fawkes is a known agitator for the rights of english roman catholics. in his possession are a pocket watch a rarity in those days.
had he succeeded in detonating the gunpowder, the next morning king james and his queen would be mangled bodies, as would all the members of the house of lords and the house of commons. smoking rubble would be all that would remain of the palace of westminster complex, including historic westminster abbey.
so goes the palace version of the events of the late evening of november the 4 th , 1605. the english public is stunned. its the equivalent of 911. a cataclysm, adam nicolson describes it in his book gods secretaries the making of the king james bible . upon his arrest, according to the official account, fawkes admits his purpose was to destroy king and parliament.
that there was some kind of plot is not in doubt. by november the 8 th , on the rack, fawkes names 12 co-conspirators. those not killed where they are tracked down are found guilty of treason later in a trial lasting less than a day. they and fawkes are hanged, drawn and quartered.
the following sunday, november the 10 th, the king james version of the plot is broadcast from the leading pulpit of the church of england, that of william barlow, bishop of rochester. barlow thunders that the enemy, meaning papists, is satanic in its wickedness. the king, their hoped-for victim, on the other hand is, mr. nicolson writes, characterized as an unqualifiedly good man . . . virtually a christ-figure.
soon all the pulpits of england echo the official account. between 1606 and 1859 the fifth is remembered in an annual service of thanksgiving in every anglican church, writes james sharpe in remember, remember a cultural history of guy fawkes day. until 1959 , it was against the law in britain not to celebrate guy fawkes day. celebrate, because from the beginning the public was giving thanks that the realm was saved and the treasonous conspirators dispatched. for centuries effigies of fawkes were burned.
the palace version becomes historical truth for humankind including me  duped again!  for most of our lives.
mr. nicolson and others now cast serious doubt on that version. many anomalies concerning the events have surfaced.
fawkes was not apprehended in a basement room but rather a ground floor room, one remarkably easily rented by the plotters. there was, accordingly, no tunnel. the authorship of the letter by which the king learned of the plot is murky. it was turned over to the king by the royal chancellor, sir robert cecil, the earl of salisbury.
sir cecil i would characterize as the dick cheney of his day. because plots were common at that time cecil had an efficient network of spies seeded among roman catholic dissidents. he kept tabs on all plots the spies discovered. this one featured a large cast of characters from several cities.
cecil kept the king in the dark about the plot except for the obscure letter. the gunpowder, it turned out, was of an inferior nature, unlikely to have achieved much result. this was odd, as fawkes definitely knew a thing or two about gunpowder. he had developed expertise with it while serving with distinction in spains army against protestant rebels in the netherlands. its conceivable the gunpowder could have been switched by someone; loads of it existed because of all the hostilities. some handwriting on fawkess confession differed from the rest.
ignored until recently is a book by jesuit historian john gerard, what was the gunpowder plot the traditional story tested by original evidence . gerard died in 1606 but his book was not published for almost three centuries, in1897, an interesting temporal fact in itself. while its true, as sharpe writes, that accounts of the plot differ as per the biases of the authors, i find gerards account pretty compelling. he writes
when we examine into the details supplied to us as to the progress of the affair, we find that much of what the conspirators are said to have done is well-nigh incredible, while it is utterly impossible that if they really acted in the manner described, the public authorities should not have had full knowledge
exactly. the evidence points to a particular kind of false-flag operation. there are many variations. in some 911 being the leading example an outrageous event is carried out by the perpetrators and blamed on the chosen enemy. in others example, gulf of tonkin nothing happens but a fiction blames the chosen enemy. the gunpowder plot is midway a plot was underway but the precise intentions of the plotters can never be known. the main feature is that, with or without taking a hand in the plot, the cecil elements manipulated events brilliantly.
cecil was heavily involved in an influential london group known as the war party. it wanted to push james into a confrontation with the spanish empire, from which the groups members hoped, among other things, to extract great personal profit.
the war party considered it politically vital to keep persecuting roman catholics. sir cecil set out, writes tarpley, to sway james to adopt his policy by means of terrorism.
it amounts to this either cecil and the war party made the gunpowder plot happen or they let it happen and made sure of a brilliantly timed exposé. and if they let it happen they made it happen.
james himself had negotiated peace with spain the previous year. his other advisors told him there was no chance of a general catholic uprising and that no foreign catholic powers were involved in the plot.
the king knew, sharpe writes, that the reality of catholicism in england around 1600 was very different from the image conjured up in government propaganda and contemporary protestant myth. sharpe again even in the face of  persecution it seems that most of englands catholics remained loyal to their monarch and wanted nothing more than to be allowed to practice their faith unmolested. the parallel with most muslims living in the uk and canada today springs to mind.
for his part, james downplayed the plot. james and his ministers, sharpe writes, showed more restraint than many modern regimes faced with similar problems.
nevertheless, the power of the imagery of what might have happened burned itself into the publics psyche, and was repeatedly fanned by the protestant and war promoting establishments.
the outcomes of this ongoing propaganda campaign are incontestable. tolerance for english roman catholics is replaced by a period of terrible bloodletting for them. numbers are killed. catholics homes are burned. a string of laws is passed restricting their rights and liberties.
the english become fixated on homeland security, nicolson writes. an inclusive, irenic idea of mutual benefit between spain and england  trade between the two countries, because of the peace treaty, had been growing is replaced in england by a defensiveaggressive complex. all catholics, of all shades, never mind their enthusiasm or not for the planned attack, are identified as the enemy.
most significantly, war with spain ensues. englands course is set for a century of wars against the spanish and portuguese empires. england for various reasons comes out victorious and on these war victories the british empire is founded in blood, deception and conquest.
 
theres no way of knowing whether the british empire  and all the consequences of its rule from capetown to canada to iraq to its american colonies  would have emerged anyway or in what form or at what pace, but we can see in retrospect that the gunpowder plot was pivotal in what did transpire.
it would be a failure of imagination not to see the parallels with 911 and society in our day of blanket war propaganda, teeming with covert agents, ever-encroaching surveillance, ever decreasing civil rights and liberties, and either helpless or conniving leaders.
lets look at false flag ops generically. its difficult in my opinion to over-estimate their terrible place in history, and their place in making history terrible. think of the wars and millions of deaths that followed the gunpowder plot, the sinking of the maine in havana harbour in 1898 that kick-started the us empires expansion to the philippines and beyond, the sinking of the lusitania that brought the usa into world war i, the torching of the german reichstag that boosted hitler to power and enabled his bloody grab for world domination, the assassination of john f. kennedy that yanked u.s. foreign policy onto a warpath, the alleged attacks during lbjs presidency the next year by north vietnamese torpedo boats on u.s. warships in the gulf of tonkin  attacks that simply did not take place but that provided the basis for the tonkin gulf resolution, passed 88-2 in the us senate. that resolution constituted the legal basis for escalating the vietnam war with an eventual death toll of more than 3-million. and 911. to name a few.
without false flag ops most wars would be harder to launch. some would barely be possible. think of the unprecedented millions of peace marchers who took to the streets prior to the invasion of iraq. if the deceptions are used to justify such wars were exposed earlier by a skeptical, independent, ferociously investigative media, we all would be living in a different world. millions of horrible deaths and all the accompanying grief could have been avoided. and the military would have to put on bake sales to raise funds.
there always has been a yearning for peace among the normal everyday citizenry finding meaningful work, marrying and raising a family, tilling the soil, writing poetry, inventing things, or  as pierre berton said was his favourite thing  getting smashed with your friends.
there are exceptions, but the horrible norm is that for wars to be launched, maintained or expanded the people have to be fooled. and history proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the most surefire way to accomplish that is to lumber them with an iconic outrage allegedly perpetrated by the designated enemy of the day. and we go on sinking ever further into the mire of deaths  the deaths of innocents, the death of promise for a better future, the death of honest history, the death of coming to grips with reality  because each new false flag op draws power from the fictions planted about all the previous ones.
and so the elites continue to hide their four aces in a rigged game. their most closely guarded secret retains the potency of the first one. remember, remember, the 5 th of november, the 11 th of september, faulkner, and george santayanas comment that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
but today we also have to remember the future. added to the false flag ops, false flag agents and false flag organizations of old are false flag digital organisms, sent to infect particular publics. one of the most recent of which ive become aware is a rogue individual or group identified as  this tricky entity fawkessecurity on monday, october 22, released via youtube and pastebin a bomb threat against an unidentified u.s. government building.
i for one smell digital gunpowder.
fawkessecurity claims to be associated with the anonymous collective. the threat of violence, however, goes against everything anonymous says it stands for. sources at anonymous are denouncing fawkessecurity and its bomb threat.
a report on this , from which i am quoting, can be found at examiner.com
following is an excerpt from the message of fawkessecurity
dear citizens of the world, ? we are anonymous. as of today 200 kilograms of composite nitroglycerin and commercial explosives have effectively been concealed in a government building, situated in the united states of america. on the 5th of november 2012  ? we are anonymous ? we are legion ? we do not forget ? we do not forgive ? on the 5th of november, you will expect us. 
as the examiner report says, the video displays many of the standard trappings of associated with anonymous and yet the threat of violence is completely out of step with the ethos that guides anonymous. the examiner report adds
multiple social media accounts have denounced fawkessecurity and their bomb threat. many speculate fawkessecurity is a false flag operation conducted by government agents in an attempt to discredit anonymous. others speculate that fawkessecurity is simply misguided, and unfamiliar with the bullet proof idea that is anonymous.
whatever the case, those who wrote the text above cant punctuate or capitalize worth a damn.
the digital and physical worlds are not separate. agents of the state infest both. although unlikely, if the threat by fawkessecurity were to be carried out today, one outcome could be to seriously besmirch anonymous. the question of whether anonymous itself might be a false flag op, or is, or could be infiltrated or otherwise manipulated, is one to be asked and answered further down the rabbit hole. such is the ultra-elusive nature of reality today.
weve come a long way from 1605 technically, but the general scheme is the same deception rides high, wide and ugly.

"billionaire donald trumps presidential campaign is flat out broke the washington post reported  
donald trump raised just 29 million for his presidential campaign committee in the first 19 days of october, about half as much as his democratic rival, putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the white house contest, new campaign finance reports filed thursday night showed. 
the gop presidential nominee had just 16 million left in his campaign coffers on oct. 19, compared to hillary clintons 62 million. when the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included, clintons war chest grew to 153 million, while trumps totaled 68 million. 
trumps total fundraising dropped 39 in the first 19 days of october. 29 million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race. at a time when trump needs boots on the ground to get out the republican vote, his presidential campaign is broke, and in debt to the tune of 2 million. there isnt going to be a last-minute ad blitz for trump, or a reservation of television time so that the republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day. 
the plan for trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies, which are good for trumps ego, but not effective in getting voters to the polls. trump promised to donate 100 million to his campaign but has only given 56 million . the billionaire who promised to self-finance has run his presidential campaign into the ground. trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in october. 
fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes. the money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election. hillary clinton is having no trouble raising money, which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters. trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that doesnt expect him to win. 
trump has done what he does best. he talked a big game while bankrupting the republican party for his own personal gain. convincing republicans to give him their nomination may go down in history as trumps biggest con of all.",133,736265,real

"chapo trap house new left-wing podcast is a flagrant rip-off of the right stuff chapo trap house new left-wing podcast is a flagrant rip-off of the right stuff 
eric striker october 27, 2016 these fags here. 
last march, a group of williamsburg trust fund bernie bros started a podcast called  chapo trap house .â the humor style and format of chapo trap house content is a left-wing carbon copy of the types of radio shows produced by alt-right sensation the right stuff , particularly the daily shoah, which uses opie  anthony style gags and parodies as a vehicle for delivering our counter-cultural and suppressed ideas. 
cth is trying to invert our ideas, bubble wrap the edges, and use our effective models to try and make leftism  an ideology that we have exposed and mocked into increasing irrelevance cool by fixing some sunglasses to hide a weak when put to reason ideology. 
they have a small troll army on social media, they do admittedly good voice impressions, our counter-semitic tropes at least one of the three is jewish are replaced by mocking working class white people and christians, they have memes, albeit even more forced than dat boi , they make watered down attempts to pull down some high-profile liberal figures like we do conservatives. they like to name drop famous comedians like trevor moore of  whitest kids u know  fame as personal friends and have fairly high profile leftist guests, which makes me think they have professional training or friends in high places. 
oh, and they spend most of their time attacking the alt-right, replacing cuck our term for them with incel, while demonstratingâ extensive knowledge of external elements of our counter-culture. theyre obviously very familiar with us, and are trying to create an audience by claiming theyre the real rebels and bomb throwers. trying to rip-off meme magic 
yet, their patreon is flush with cash way out of proportion to their average plays, i.e. they have big money donors relative to our camp, their soundcloud and social media pages arent muzzled like ours, theres nobody trying to silence them or shut them down. they can do stuff under their full names, yet mysteriously, their capitalist bosses wont fire or black list them for calling for the death of capitalists. they get invited to do live performances in some of the jewiest, most prestigious, high rolling and trendy venues in nyc. 
unlike the daily stormer, the right stuff or ricky vaughn who they constantly reference with typical seattle bourgeois shit-lib snark, they can say and do whatever they want because big capital and the american plutocracy is, at the very least, behind the core of their worldview open borders, amalgamation of cultures and races, feminism. 
chapo trap houses podcast is fairly new, yet already attracting positive attention from our elites. in their defense, they are critical of hillary clinton, yet establishment judeo-left individuals and institutions, from the hillary gun-runners at mediate to jeet heer, have commented quite positively on the show. compared to trs, they are getting quite a bit of very friendly publicity as a form of reaction to the rise of the alt-right.

most of the blacks and browns who stand on top of the two white male goyim cis males in the progressive stack would sucker punch these private school kids who only know what niggers are in theory and steal their iphones if they had the chance. as for the obese feminists with magenta bowl cuts, they would curl-up into a ball and wail like banshees from all of the micro aggressions these three directly and indirectly engage in. the queers, pedos, trannies, and whatever other group of mentally ill perverts front and center as moral arbitrators of the modern judeo-left would distrust them for their pathology of enjoying sexual intercourse with women. last and not least, most leftists in the west today are humorless, moralistic mental midgets. 
the real purpose of cth is to staunch the bleeding of young and normal white males coming into our camp in droves right now. by using methods we have proven to resonate with this demographic, they hope to try and sell a state-sanctioned ideology whose only natural endpoint is basically the extermination of us and our families, but with an edgy veneer. this has been done in a different form in the past, it is similar to what the sony contracted, mtv promoted millionaires in rage against the machine did in the 90s plastic revolution in the name of art that isnt actually revolutionary.

imran gashkori  sports editor  
as excitement for summer cricket builds, wynnum father chris richards has honed his preparation, taking 7 wickets in a frightening spell yesterday. 
they were coming out perfectly, the 36-year-old said between celebratory beers. the australian tradition of backyard cricket has gotten much more competitive in recent years. photo supplied. 
warnie always said one brings two in this case i went further, he said. 
the full-time landscaper took the wickets of his three kids aged 5, 8  13 as well as his wife 32 and two kids from down the street ages unknown. 
i was a pretty talented junior but my best was only three or four for, he said. 
richards claimed the scalps in just four overs on his 16-meter backyard pitch aided by generous electric wickie rules and the controversial one-hand-one-bounce law. richards vehemently denies that he tampered with the ball, despite half of it being covered in a mysterious tape for the duration of the match. photo supplied. 
however, video has emerged of richards allegedly tampering with the ball with what seems like red electrical tape. 
the tape was already on the ball before we started playing. thats well within the rules, he said. 
neighbours described his spell as frightening and intense but added numerous dismissals were through the six-and-out by-law. 
in addition to his economical and wicket-to-wicket line-and-length bowling style, richards also used an impressive array of sledges and other psychological tactics to get under the skin of the opposition team. 
his daughter kayla explains. 
dad would dip one in short and id have to dive out-of-the-way, she said. 
every time i tried to dodge the short balls, hed call me a poofter, which doesnt make any sense to me, 
despite the criticism levelled against him, richards has lashed out at his detractors. 
you dont hear johno mitchell johnson whinge about how he takes em the one-time 3rd grader said. 
im already growing the mo so i can steam in with him when the ashes start. 
i played it smart. me boy jacob aged 8  is a pretty timid kid. i knew after knocking over darcy aged 5 with a full toss that he would be pretty nervous at the crease. i banged the first one in short to get him backing away. he was a frightened rabbit after that. all i had to do was put the next one on the stumps. seven balls later i had his wicket.

"meet all the pundits pandering for a trump adminstration job  daily wire meet all the pundits pandering for a trump adminstration job by aaron bandler november 22, 2016 
with donald trump set to take office in a couple of months, a number of his lackeys have reportedly been in talks about possibly serving in the administration. as of this writing, there are three pro-trump pundits that might be in the trump administration. 
eric bolling. politico reported that bolling was seen at trump tower and was reportedly discussed for a position in the department of commerce. what exactly that position that will be is not clear. bolling told politico that he ""can't confirm anything."" 
geraldo rivera flat-out asked bolling on the five if he had been offered a job, and bolling gave a non-answer . 
bolling has been with fox news since 2008, where he is the co-host of the five and hosts the weekend show cashin' in . before then, he had been an analyst on cnbc and a new york mercantile exchange nymex trader. bolling has been an ardent supporter of trump from the get-go, to the point where he resorted to some loony ideas . 
laura ingraham. according to cnn money , ingraham is being heavily considered for president trump's press secretary. here is what ingraham has said on the matter 
""i am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs. so we'll see what happens,"" ingraham said on fox news. 
she cautioned ""i think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative."" but she strongly suggested that some sort of trump administration post is in the works. 
""it's a big decision, but i'm at the point where, if my country needs me, and if i can do something to actually, you know, advance the trump agenda, which is stuff i have written about now for 15 years, with trade, immigration and just renewing america, then i obviously have to seriously consider that,"" she told fox's tucker carlson. 
like bolling, ingraham, who has been a nationally syndicated radio host since 2001 , has also been an early supporter of trump, going as far as saying that nevertrump conservatives support partial birth abortion, and her website, lifezette, attacked conservatives like ben shapiro for opposing the alt-right. as usual, shapiro punched back hard . 
jeanine pirro. pirro, accompanied by rudy giuliani, was seen headed inside trump tower, which has led to speculation that she is being considered for a job in the trump administration, according to page six . what that job would be is not known. 
pirro also has been an early trump supporter, and she has claimed to have known him for 30 years . pirro's ex-husband, al pirro, has been described as ""a man donald trump keeps on retainer"" as a real-estate lawyer, and trump once donated 20,000 to pirro when she ran for new york state attorney general. 
pirro has been with fox news since 2006 and hosts justice with judge jeanine on saturdays. she also has an extensive legal career as a prosecutor in the state of new york and initially challenged hillary clinton when she ran for re-election in the senate before dropping out to run for state attorney general. tags",43,736290,real
"uk police six times more likely to stop and search black people videos uk police six times more likely to stop and search black people black people in britain are more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people, according to new official figures.  october 28, 2016 be sociable, share! stop and search has always been a controversial method used by police officers in england and wales and has always disproportionately targeted black and minority ethnic bme communities in britain. 
according to official figures released in 2013, 27 percent of stop and searches were not based on reasonable grounds for suspicion and concerns, as well as disproportionately targeting young people from bme backgrounds. 
in 2014, then-home secretary theresa may, decided to crack down on stop and search, penalizing police forces who used it and imposed restrictions on officers in 2014. 
a year later in 2015, the head of londons metropolitan police blamed an increase in knife crime on the home secretarys stop and search reforms. in the same year, the number of fatal stabbings increased by 18 percent in london. 
london knife crime is now at a four year high, according to a report published by the police and crime committee which suggests violent crime, including knives, guns, sexual assaults and robbery have all risen year on year, with knives increasingly becoming a weapon of choice amongst young people . 2 officers assaulted whilst detaining person with a knife. glad to hear they are ok! thank you dedication proactivepolicing stopandsearch  
 nick downing nickdowningmps october 26, 2016 
while the latest figures released by the home office, reveal that the use of stop and search by police had reduced by more than a quarter across the board  stopping white people fell more sharply. 
the statistics reveal that people from bme backgrounds were still three times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people in 201516 and black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. 
amber rudd, britains relatively new home secretary, says the statistics are unacceptable yet added that the powers are vital for police to fight crime. 
a similar story has been seen for the black group, which fell from over six times more likely to just over four times more likely between the years ending march 31, 2011 and 2015, before rising again to over six times more likely in the year ending march 31 2016, the home office report said. 
shadow home secretary diane abbott, said the decline in stop and search clearly shows there is some effort to use these police powers more reasonably. but there are clear signs that some communities are being disproportionately targeted. 
amber rudd, the same home secretary who suggested companies draw up a list of their foreign workers, said that, no one should be stopped on the basis of their race or ethnicity.

"wh press secretary says obama's denial about clinton server was 'entirely factual' after the release of a wikileaks email chain from march 2015 on tuesday in which a top clinton aide admitted president barack obama falsely claimed he did not know about hillary clintons private server use while she was secretary of state, white house press secretary josh earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue.
what the president said was an entirely factual response, earnest said to a group of reporters in los angeles where obama was attending democratic fundraisers.
earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the presidents actions as mere conspiracies.

he continued, but theyve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so i guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies.
obama himself denied any knowledge of the server, telling cbs reporter bill plante in march 2015, just after the server revelations that he learned of the clintons private email server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.
 
several days after the server revelations in march 2015, earnest told the press that obama knew about clintons email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server.
he reiterated that position on tuesday.
the president did trade emails with secretary clinton, not a large number of them, earnest said.
of course the president had possession of secretary clintons email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.

"unhinged trump supporter holds children at gunpoint over damaged trump sign video on november 4, 2016 445 pm  
if you had wanted to give trump supporters the benefit of the doubt, this most recent incident proves that its far too much to give them. 
a 56-year-old man in allen park, michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought theyd damaged the donald trump sign on his lawn. yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters trump has attracted. 
the man, michael robert kubek, had called police on october 29th to report that his trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. when the police arrived at the scene, they didnt find kubek at his home  however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. 
the police saw kubek standing over six children ages 12-14, who were sitting on the grass. kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. the children denied any involvement, and the officers told kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. 
according to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock twitter twitter 
the news-herald reported 
the officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but kubek repeated that he could not. the officer then asked kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. according to police, kubek said yes. 
in response to another question from the officer, kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered. 
yes, a grown man used a gun because he felt outnumbered by a small group of innocent kids. this is exactly the type of unhinged person who shouldnt be trusted with firearms! kubeks hearing is scheduled for december 5th  lets hope that whatever happens to kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner. you can watch a report below

 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. for me, that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights, on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community, that will stand up and say no to citizens united, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather, her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics, rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. ms. clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country, and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however, was representative of this tactic. 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively, women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the lgbt community accounts for less than 5 percent of the american population, clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values, primarily christians. leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada. a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the u.s. at least not at present; however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil. hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, citizens united, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists. even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark, unaccountable money, the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood, with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros, the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america, someone with whom the clintons also have a long association. 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like. her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely. despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media, there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. 
in recent days, weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected, from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign, the democratic national committee and the white house. 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. what all americans  not just voters, and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. 
the burning question is this in the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?

"comment on what is at stake in this election  paul craig roberts by toby i just heard an npr presstitute declare that texas, a traditional sure thing for republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. little wonder if this report on zero hedge is correct. apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for killary. 
 
from my long experience in journalism, i know the american public is not very sharp. nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who hillary represents would actually vote for her. it makes no sense. if this were the case, how did trump get the republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? 
it seems obvious that the majority of americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the one percent who own hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. 
furthermore, if trumps election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell ushillarys win is 93 certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncementthe vicious 247 attacks on trump would be pointless. wouldnt they? why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? trump takes aim at those rigging the system 
there are reports that a company associated with hillary backer george soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states , including states that determine election outcomes. i do not know that these reports are correct. however, i do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule america are opposed to trump being elected president for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. 
it is hard to believe that dispossessed americans will vote for hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. hillary has denigrated ordinary americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesnt even know who they are. clearly, hillary, paid 675,000 by goldman sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. she represents the one percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary americans down the toilet. 
what is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that trumps lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. at no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the united states and its european vassals are planning an attack. architects of regime change wars 
a threatened russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of hillary clinton. 
if the american people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the american people are too stupid to exist. they will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. 
donald trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with russia when putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. 
in contrast, hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of russia to be the new hitler and has threatened russia with military action. hillary talks openly about regime change in russia. 
surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and tv media would raise this most important of all points. but where have you seen it? 

only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media. 
in other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. and yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a peoples democracy protected by a free press. 
in truth, this mythical description of america is merely a cloak for the rule of the oligarchs. and the oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy.

"explosive audio surfaces of gop senator joking about gun owners shooting clinton by sean colarossi on mon, oct 31st, 2016 at 756 pm cnn has obtained audio of north carolina gop senator richard burr joking about gun owners putting a ""bullseye"" on hillary clinton. share on twitter print this post 
cnn has obtained brand new audio of north carolina republican senator richard burr joking about gun owners putting a bullseye on hillary clinton. 
the despicable comments come as burr faces a close senate race against democratic opponent deborah ross. both candidates are within a point of each other, according to realclearpolitics. 
more of the cnn report  
the north carolina republican, locked in a tight race for reelection, quipped that as he walked into a gun shop nothing made me feel better than seeing a magazine about rifles with a picture of hillary clinton on the front of it. 
i was a little bit shocked at that  it didnt have a bullseye on it, he said saturday to gop volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in mooresville, north carolina. but on the bottom right of the magazine, it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. so let me assure you, theres an army of support out there right now for our candidates. 
this type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to republican leaders in 2016. as the campaign has gone on, the hateful and violent rhetoric, particularly from the man at the top of the republican ticket, has become increasingly worse. 
at one point this year, donald trump suggested that second amendment people should take up arms against clinton if she nominates a supreme court justices they dont like. he also said that hed like to see what happens if the democratic nominees bodyguards were disarmed. 
as cnn notes, trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language  or anything hes ever said or done  but burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed, although it does not excuse what he said. 
the comment i made was inappropriate, and i apologize for it, the republican senator said, according to cnn. 
this type of imagery has no place in our politics, regardless of whether its being said in public or private, especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward hillary clinton from trump supporters. 
whether its trump or burr, voters should remember their irresponsible language when they go to vote in just one week.",133,736269,real

 washington, dc   judicial watch today released 323 pages of new department of state documents, including previously unreleased email exchanges in which clinton and top aide huma abedin sent classified information over clintons clintonemail.com unsecure email system. according to freedom of information act foia exemptions cited in the documents obtained by judicial watch, three of the clinton-abedin email exchanges contained material classified to protect national security. 
also included in the newly obtained documents is an additional instance of the state department doing special favors for a high-dollar clinton foundation donor. and the documents include instances of the distribution by state department officials of clintons government schedule to members of the clinton foundation staff. 
the documents contain emails not previously turned over to the state department, bringing the known total to date of such emails uncovered by judicial watch to 238 new clinton emails not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that clinton turned over to the state department. these records further appear to contradict statements by clinton that,  as far as she knew , all of her government emails were turned over to the state department.

"un conflit militaire entre la russie et les etats-unis est-il possible ? opinion un su-25 à la base aérienne russe de hmeimim, syrie. crédit  ap 
la crise syrienne est bien plus dangereuse que les crises de la guerre froide, y compris que la célèbre crise des missiles de cuba de 1962. aujourdhui, le potentiel de conflit dans les relations entre la russie et les etats-unis est plus élevé que ce nétait le cas dans les années 1960. rivalité systémique une armée commune européenne pour éviter la désintégration de lue? ce nest pas un hasard si le politologue américain john lewis gaddis a qualifié la guerre froide de  longue période de paix  . au premier abord, la période qui sétend entre le milieu des années 1950 et le milieu des années 1980 était une époque de confrontation dure entre deux superpuissances aux idéologies irréconciliables.
en réalité, la confrontation entre lurss et les etats-unis suivait des règles strictes et ne sest jamais approchée malgré la rhétorique virulente de la confrontation armée directe. 
la possession darmes nucléaires par lurss et les etats-unis nétait pas la cause principale de cette longue paix. les dirigeants des superpuissances navaient aucune raison politique de lancer un affrontement direct. les etats-unis et lunion soviétique navaient pas de concurrents dans leur rôle de leaders des mondes capitaliste et socialiste. lire aussi  convoi de lonu bombardé en syrie  la coopération russo-américaine se fissure 
labsence de motifs politiques était complétée par le manque de capacités techniques à mener une guerre directe. situés dans deux hémisphères différents, lurss et les etats-unis ne pouvaient pas occuper leur territoire mutuel. aucune partie ne disposait de la supériorité suffisante pour garantir la défaite de ladversaire et remporter la victoire dans un conflit régional majeur. 
lidéologie soviétique, tout comme lidéologie américaine, étaient intransigeantes devant ladversaire. les deux superpuissances affirmaient le principe de compétition entre le communisme et le libéralisme. lotan trouverait-elle la russie plus dangereuse que daech? premièrement, cela signifiait que l urss et les etats-unis se considéraient mutuellement comme deux entités égales. deuxièmement, les deux parties étaient prêtes à suivre des règles. troisièmement, une compétition suppose que ladversaire dispose daspects positifs qui doivent être adaptés ou surpassés.
a la moindre escalade, les dirigeants soviétiques et américains sempressaient de lancer des négociations et de discuter des conditions dun compromis. rivalité non-systémique 
après le démantèlement de lunion soviétique en 1991, la donne a changé. la russie et les etats-unis ont commencéà accumuler des motifs dun conflit militaire. les deux puissances nucléaires aux capacités comparables ont dû construire leurs relations dans le cadre dun même ordre global mondial. 
les contradictions idéologiques réelles se sont justement fait sentir après 1993. dès la fin de 1994, la russie refusait officiellement à reconnaître les concepts américains de leadership et dextension de la démocratie. lire aussi  le bouclier us en europe serait-il dirigé contre la russie et la chine ? 
en 1997, la russie avec la chine ont avancé lidée dun monde multipolaire. cette idée a eu bien du mal à passer à washington, qui prétendait au rôle de leader de lordre mondial en gestation. il ne sagissait plus de la coexistence de deux camps, mais de deux façons de construire un monde globalisé. 
toutes les administrations américaines étaient particulièrement irritées par deux facteurs. le premier  le potentiel militaire conservé par moscou. le deuxième  la conservation par la russie de son statut de membre permanent du conseil de sécurité de l onu , qui lui permet de bloquer les décisions de washington ou de les rendre illégitimes. syrie  la guerre des résolutions en dépit de la déclaration sur le  partenariat stratégique  , lobjectif de la politique américaine se réduisait à diminuer rapidement et, idéalement, à liquider le potentiel stratégique russe pour le ramener à un niveau suffisamment sûr pour les etats-unis. 
les élites russes , de leur côté, comprenaient parfaitement les raisons qui motivaient les actions des etats-unis. moscou était particulièrement inquiet quant à la réforme du droit international entreprise par washington. 
à travers un enchaînement de précédents, la diplomatie américaine affirmait deux principes. le premier  léviction forcée des dirigeants des états souverains avec leur condamnation successive par un tribunal international. le deuxième  le désarmement forcé des régimes dangereux du point de vue de washington et, en premier lieu, la privation de ces régimes de leur potentiel militaire de destruction massive. lire aussi  la russie prête à abattre des avions américains en cas de frappe en syrie 
la guerre en irak et les crises postérieures autour des programmes nucléaires de liran, de la corée du nord et du pakistan étaient perçues par moscou comme le rodage dun scénario de visant à confisquer des adm à un pays à problème du point de vue de washington. les dirigeants russes soupçonnaient que lobjectif ultime des etats-unis était dutiliser ces approches à lintention de la russie. 
les nouvelles formes de coopération ont donné naissance à un nouveau type de conflits militaro-politiques. après 1991, les etats-unis ont utilisé la force contre les pays quils désignaient comme  etats-voyous  , peaufinant ainsi leur modèle de guerre punitive contre des régimes donnés. washington rompt le dialogue avec moscou sur la syrie  et après? les dirigeants russes ne pouvaient que soupçonner que la fédération de russie était lobjectif final de ces actions. moscou, quant à lui, sadonnait régulièrement à des démonstrations de force pour contraindre washington à chercher un compromis.
un système de confrontation indirecte, mais rude, sest installé entre la russie et les etats-unis. les crises en yougoslavie, tchétchénie, géorgie et en ukraine en sont des exemples. 
à ces causes sajoute les progrès dans l armement . la création dunités aéroportées autonomes, de systèmes de défense antiaérienne et antimissile, darmes de précision, etc. rendent le scénario dun conflit régional entre la russie et les etats-unis plus réaliste du point de vue technique. on ne peut exclure léventualité que, dans les 1015 prochaines années, la tentation dy recourir grandisse pour les élites de ces deux puissances. lire aussi  gorbatchev   le monde a atteint une limite dangereuse  lérosion de la dissuasion nucléaire 
la forme future des conflits avec la russie et la chine est esquissée, pour la première fois, dans la stratégie militaire nationale des etats-unis en 1995. 
pour les experts américains, ces chocs pourraient prendre la forme dune intervention de washington dans un conflit entre moscou ou pékin avec lun de leurs voisins  une sorte de tempête du désert régionale dans un théâtre dopérations limité. bombes et diplomatie  un an d'opération russe en syrie sans compter quau cours des vingt dernières années, la russie et la chine ont accru leur capacité de défense et mis fin à la supériorité américaine dans les armes de précision. les conflits en géorgie, en ukraine et en syrie doivent être vus comme des tests, une  épreuve de force  pour un affrontement éventuel entre la russie et les etats-unis.
il est difficile de présager comment se terminerait un tel conflit sil devait, hélas, se produire, mais on peut être certains quil mettra fin à lordre mondial établi, avec son système financier global et ses processus de mondialisation, ordre au sein du quel lonu joue un rôle central. 
sans doute, le monde reviendra alors à un modèle detats-nations fermés et hostiles sans normes de droit international et à lidéologie du culte de la force militaire. après un affrontement hypothétique entre la russie et les etats-unis, le monde rappellera plutôt le système de versailles-washington en vigueur de 1919 à 1938.

"clinton campaign questions release of fbi's marc rich pardon records clinton campaign questions release of fbi's marc rich pardon records   source zero hedge 
as reported moments ago, in what appears to have been a surprise release, the fbi's vault twitter account released 129 pages of files related to the fbi's 2001 prove into bill clinton's 2001 pardon of marc rich. and while nbc reported that the files were releases as part of a normal subpoena, the increasingly paranoid not without reason clinton campaign immediately had questions. according to politico , ""hillary clintons presidential campaign raised questions about the timing of the fbis release tuesday of records on a 15-year-old investigation into president bill clintons pardon to fugitive financier marc rich."" 
the fbi posted the 129 pages of records in its online freedom of information act reading room in apparent response to a foia request seeking information on fbi inquiries into the clinton foundation. on the website, the release was dated monday, but an fbi twitter account flagged the new posting at noon on tuesday. 
as politico adds, the clinton campaign, which is already at odds with fbi director james comey over his disclosure of new evidence in the clinton email probe, immediately questioned why clinton-related records were being released just a week before the election. 
absent a foia litigation deadline, this is odd. will fbi be posting docs on trumps housing discrimination in 70s? clinton press secretary brian fallon asked on twitter. absent a foia litigation deadline, this is odd. will fbi be posting docs on trump's housing discrimination in '70s?  
 brian fallon brianefallon november 1, 2016 
when reached by politico, spokespeople for the fbi and the justice department did not immediately respond to questions about whether there were any lawsuits seeking the newly posted material or whether a judge had set a deadline for its disclosure. 
despite the lack of major revelations in the documents, which constitute only a part of the fbis files on the inquiry, the atmospherics in the records are unhelpful to the clinton campaign. the records repeatedly refer to the probe being handled by the public corruption unit and make clear that the fbi was examining claims that denise richs democratic party donations may have been intended to influence the fugitives pardon. 
it appears that the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed, the internal fbi memos said. 
indeed, the request for a pardon for marc rich and his business partner, pincus green, did not go through normal channels at the justice department but was sent directly to the white house. however, presidents are free to grant executive clemency outside the justice department channel and many presidents have done so. 

the investigation was eventually handed off to comey, who was white's successor as u.s. attorney. comey elected not to seek any charges in the case. 
so purely a coincidence? or an internal message sent from fbi staffers, and if so addressed to whom clinton or comey?",26,736269,fake

"pope francis warns nations not to take in more refugees than they can assimilate november 3, 2016 pope francis warns nations not to take in more refugees than they can assimilate 
in an unusually nuanced discourse, pope francis has seemed to walk back earlier statements encouraging european nations to open their doors to migrants and refugees, suggesting that harboring unassimilated migrants can lead to a dangerous ghettoization. during the short papal press conference on the return flight from sweden to rome tuesday, the pope expressed his belief that peoples hearts should be open to migrants and refugees, but that political authorities need to exercise prudence so as not to allow more migrants into the country than can be reasonably assimilated.

 robert costa costareports october 31, 2016 
the trump campaign is now that reality detached place where a few true believers are running the show. this is why trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning. trump still thinks that he can win michigan, wisconsin, and new mexico. wisconsin might be the most laughable of three delusions because trump was routed in the republican primary there, and gop support from wisconsin republicans like paul ryan and scott walker has been lukewarm at best. 
these are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat. the comey letter didnt move the needle for trump. it didnt give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for hillary clinton. 
the clinton emails didnt save trump, so now he is going to waste his time campaigning in states that he will lose in search of a miracle as his poorly managed presidential bid stumbles to the finish line.",133,736268,real

"comment on black racism by martin wright november 14, 2015 at 1033 am  reply 
stereotypes exist for a reason 
and everyone does it, so dont act like youre exempt from a healthy way of examining and protecting your environment. 
i noticed this subject coming up more than once in the news feed on fb today, that i thought id address it, instead of acting like its the big elephant in the roomthe elephant is that only whites are to blame for stereotyping and racism, and that blacks are the only ones who receive racism, that is so far from the truth, as can be found in any google search on how whites are treated by blacks. studies have found they are more racist than whites and i know why, mainly due to the chip that is on their shoulderdiscussed later. 
racism and stereotyping exist not only because of the obvious, like ones experiences and their encounters with certain individual types, but also what one has been taught, right or wrong or better yet, both experience and what they have taught matches, so how can one not come to a solid conclusion? at this point their views are pretty much sealed. kind of like getting saved it isnt enough to know in your head something is true about jesus and his word, but once the heart agrees, then its pretty much sealed. why are blacks sorry not into being politically correct, no one is calling me an european americanand real africans hate the comparisonlol, google it the only ones who cry racism at every turn, at every perceived injustice, at every corrective criticism, at every comment made, at not taking accountability for their actions, etc?.the main reason is. 
the victim mentality want to read a great book on the subject, ken hamblins pick a better country and plain talk and common sensei have them both and i use to listen to him when he was on the air and he is right ,and he is as black as they get, color wise and he is from harlem. so i trust his and bill cosbys although, he has tarnished his name now take on the victim mentality. all one has to do is look around them and see it is true. 
as you can see, my focus will be on racism against people of color not against whites, because that is the consensus going around and what i have experienced and others i know have experienced. and before anyone tries to call me a racist, i am not! i judge people individually, till you prove the stereotype right, then that only makes me more cautious of the next person who comes along. and so far in my 51 yrs of experience, i have learned that stereotypes exist for a reason. but, like everyone else who has their flaws, such as any white insecure jealous woman, or any man trying to get into my pants, or anyone who exhibits unsafe or unhealthy attributes, i will still give another person, no matter what their race is, the benefit of the doubt, although i will say, some more than others. im not stupid, or ignorant, its called being wise. it is one thing to respect others and be cordial, it is another to just let anyone into your life, or do business with them. trust is earned not freely given. . going back to the victim mentality, this is what is holding the black community down and is why stereotypes and racism exist. saying it doesnt, or trying to twist or spin into existence something that just isnt true, will not fly with most who have even half a brain. common sense and ones experience will always trump political correctness. the media doesnt want you to know the truth as they omit or spin things, but they can only do so much, because of all the reality shows. uncensored behavior and mentality and news pieces that portray a better reality. sad thing is too many just wont say anything, they just talk in private about the subject among those liked minded out of fear! but truth is truth, so here goes. 
does anyone else find it interesting that throughout history, many different races, if not all have been slaves,    yet only blacks are left with a victim mentality?dont get me wrong, what was done to them and any slave at the time or in the past and even now are we focused on the 200,000 sex trafficked in sacramento alone???of course not!!! was wrong. i would have to say that the mistreatment and abuse of another is wrong, but slavery was a way of life even going back to the biblical times. when you think about it, we are all slaves to something. slavery and bondage are a way of life even when it comes to ourselves. some are in bondage to their desires and indulgent behaviors, to their insecurities, to their relationships, to their job, to their boss, to their parents, to their children etc. the only free slaveis one who is a bond servant to christ and who has follow his lordship in their life. ok, no rabbit trails, ill leave it at that. 
point is slavery is not as dirty of a word as many would like to think.like many things in our lives, it isnt what happens to us that matters, but what we do with it.sad to say, most, but not all blacks throughout history have chosen to take the negative reaction for their lot in lifethe blame game is so unbecoming and senseless. i dont care who you are, if one cannot take accountability individually for their own actions, in spite of their surroundings and circumstances, then one will naturally fall prey to the negativity that comes with that choice. one of my 5 factors, is 1 ones own sin. starts here john mcwhorter and ken hamblin adequately and articulately explains all the ends and outs of a victim mentality among the black community, way better than i can. all i know is, no other race that has been slaves throughout history has played the race card nor have they proclaimed themselves as victimsnone. if anything they overcame and contributed! they banded together did not destroy each other, black on black crime is extremely high, 90 and supported each other, financially and in many other ways, to say we are a proud people, we can do this 
more food for thought. i have often wondered, have any of those who feel such an outrage against how the blacks were treated while enslaved all nationalities throughout history endured the same, blacks are no different ever thought about what i am about to say? like i said, we all have choices to go positive or negative in any given situation and to me i would think the black community would be able to move on.be thankful for being brought to america for their future generations after slavery. look what they were saved from. for one america gave them christianitysalvation! 
who possesses more slaves today than any other groupafrica!  so why is it ok, that blacks can enslave blacks, but no other group can? why is it that blacks can call themselves degrading names, yet no one else can? why can they kill whites and not be called racist, but if a black is killed by a white automatically they are racist? why the double standards?do they really want to go back to. 
genocide, slavery, rape an epidemic of aids etc. and black women, do you really want to be dominated by a man and treated as property and have your cliterious cut off as a child without any anesthetic and live the life of an average african woman.. very hard work, no pleasure, no value, life of servant hood slavery always in fear? 
seriously, what are thesevictim mentality type people fighting for? do they want to go back to africa? of course not, they claim they want to be treated equallywell, that sounds fair to me, then act like it! 
stop fitting the stereotype, be the one who says, i dont care what others think of me, if being an uncle tom or a sell out is what it takes to be equal then so be it. i will not play victim, i will take the bull by the horn be accountable for my behavior and do what it takes legally, ethically, morally and responsibly to fit in! and if more and more people did that then stereotypes would change. 
i could write more on the subject, but feel this is a good place to stop.",65,736272,fake
"bombshell report exposes fbi agents trying to get trump elected tweets  new century times according to reuters 
the new emails turned up as fbi investigators were examining electronic devices used by former democratic representative anthony weiner in connection with an alleged sexting scandal. weiners estranged wife, huma abedin, is a clinton confidante. 
according to two law enforcement sources, there is a group of investigators within the fbis new york field office  the office that discovered the recent anthony weiner emails  that are hostile toward clinton  and it is believed that this faction is behind the recent media leaks about the ongoing clinton foundation investigation. 
one thing is for sure  if clinton wins the election on tuesday, the democratic party will undoubtedly be launching an investigation into the fbi, and it would be more than ironic if the most memorable scandal of the 2016 election ends up being about the fbi, instead of clintons emails. 
apparently, trump supporter rudy giuliani  the former mayor of new york city  might have some involvement in it as well 
it is a clear violation of the law by these fbi agents in an attempt to influence a presidential election. if any democrats were thinking about staying home on election day, this should really inspire them to do the opposite. 
clinton needs every vote now, as people are going to ridiculous lengths to make this election work for trump, who is currently losing in the polls. clinton is facing more opposition and obstacles than any presidential candidate has ever dealt with, and even those in power are abusing their authority to get her insane opponent into the white house.",119,736272,fake

"badass trump chairwoman shreds michelle  hillarys favorite spokesman share this 
donald trumps diversity chairwoman brunell donald-kyei has been laying waste to anyone who takes her on, and she just shredded one of michelle obamas favorite spokesmen, brian benjamin, who now works on hillary clintons campaign. when it came to the race card, brunell was lethal, cutting down his every liberal lie. she tore him apart, then kicked him to the curb, as another michelle and hillary spokesman bit the dust. michelle obamas favorite pundit brian benjamin left, hillary  her hot sauce middle, brunell donald-kyei right 
brian benjamin kept an arrogant smile on his face as donald trumps diversity chairwoman brunell donald-kyei surgically sliced through hillarys pandering to the black community. they appeared on fox and friends a few days ago and the video is only getting more popular as interest in brunells tactics is making headlines. 
unsurprisingly, fox  friends monday has been focusing on the latest to emerge out of the wikileaks scandal, and one detail concerning the use of the phrase  yo mama , suggested a pandering effort to an african american crowd by clinton earlier this year. joining fox  friends to discuss was vice-chair of the trump national diversity coalition brunell donald-kyei who said, the pandering is not working. black people just want a real seat at the table. via mediaite  
as brunell laid benjamin out cold, he had to pull out the race card, but that was a wrong move. brunell was waiting for it, and she launched into a tirade that made hillary and her hot sauce in my purse comment look as stupid as it sounded, as poor steve doocy tried to moderate. 
brunell went off, saying the communities need jobs, not hot sauce and yo mama jokes. she added that the black community wants empowerment and the democratic party to keep its promises. benjamin was quick to interrupt, alleging trump talks about law and order but ignores systemic issues between the community and the police. however, brunell wasnt about to let him get away with his lie. 
she quickly pointed out that mass incarceration happened under bill and hillary clinton, telling benjamin that he knows that too. his wife hillary was ok with that. so dont go there, she said. let donald trump fix it. let a person who is a builder and a doer fix it. 
benjamin tried to retort, calling trump a racist, and thats all it took to really cause brunell to unleash.  not a loser, not a taco bowl, or needy latino? really? are we going there? catholics are bastardized. are we going there?  she asked, referring to the wikileaks emails that exposed the hillary camps true thoughts and nasty remarks about many americans. 
benjamin shot back, yea, lets go there, before brunell finished him off, saying, i went there, wikileaks is out in the streets, sir. i read wikileaks. i read about the corruption. 
this exchange proves that when these hillary shills get beat, they turn to the race card every time. when brunell hears that, as a black woman, she can go full throttle at benjamin, and his nervous laughter and scoffing means he is embarrassed and lost this argument, which shreds hillarys whole narrative about why americans shouldnt vote for trump. 
hillary is a one note wonder. she has no positive record to run on, and her whole campaign is based on bullying trump supporters. in her narrative, trump is a nazi and so are those of us who support him. so, we are fair game to be bullied  on the internet or in person as we have seen the paid thugs do. 
its all smoke and mirrors because it just doesnt hold true, and brunell brought that out as she left benjamin, one of hillarys token black spokesmen, to languish as he failed to make anyone believe the lie hillary is trying to sell to americans. this is all hillarys got to run on, and it will not be enough to win.",108,736264,fake

it is human nature to want to accumulate wealth. it is also human nature to want to keep what you have. one of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them. a democratic republic is particularly easy to influence. the wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs. they can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics. or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control. in the us, the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system.
for example, liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less. it sounds like a populist policy but it is not. progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate. progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down. thats why no matter which political party is in power, we are still stuck with progressive taxation.
everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat. but once you get a true wildcard like trump, the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order. thats what we are seeing now. the elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure trump does not upset their gravy train. the elite sense their time is short.
voter fraud 
the first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud. in his gettysburg address, trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs
according to pew, there are 24 million voter registrations that in the us that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. 1.8 million dead people are registered to vote, and some of them are voting. i wonder how that happens? 2.8 million people are registered to vote in more than one state. these are numbers folks. these are numbers. 14 of noncitizens are registered to vote.
liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement. they say that it negatively affects minority voters, who may not have any identification. but this is obvious nonsense. the real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult.
by raising concerns about voter fraud, trump is firing a warning shot. he is saying that he will fight voter fraud, unlike prior gop candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side. simply putting the democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise. the only question is whether trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place.
the lügenpresse 
a second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media. these include the three oldest television news networks abc, cbs, nbc as well as the newer ones cnn, msnbc, fox. it also includes the remaining newspapers, especially the new york times, washington post, and the wall street journal. of these, the only ones that are reliably conservative are fox and the wsj, both of which are owned by rupert murdock. but even here, it is more accurate to call fox and the wsj neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade.
trump is very media savvy. hes been in the public eye since the 1980s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity. trump has used this to highlight his policies. by making controversial statements, he has been able to force the media to cover his positions. still, the nonstop smear campaign has hurt trumps numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources.
new media outlets like return of kings, breitbart, and danger  play have been more favorable to trump but the most highly funded new media such as daily beast, heat street, buzzfeed, and huffington post all push the globalist message. the end result that trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side.
voter discouragement fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage trump voters.
another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage trump voters from going to the polls. one way they do this is to over poll democrats to make it look like trump is losing. for example, one recent poll placed hillary 12 points higher than trump. but even obama was only able to beat mccain by 7 points even though he was packing stadiums of 70,000 people. and hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that obama did in 2008.
there is a huge motivation gap between trump and clinton. recently, trump held a rally in tampa where 28,000 people showed up. some of these people waited in line for 12 hours for the chance to see trump. a day later, hillary hosted a rally in florida where only 1000 people showed up. and some of those were likely paid plants. her running mate tim kaine did even worse barely getting 30 people to show up for one of his events.
one day before the brexit vote, polls showed remain leading by 10 points. leave ended up winning by 3.5 points.
why does the legacy media report polls that show trump losing by a landslide? because it is designed to dishearten trump voters.
conclusion will trump be able to overcome the rigged system? it will be a heroic achievement if he does. one thing is certain this is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might. the elites want us to be discouraged, to give up hope, to lie down and die. that is the one thing we will never do. even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you, go to the ballot box on november 8th. regardless of what you may hear otherwise, your life will be very different under president trump than it will be under globalist pawn hillary.
win or lose, our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on november 8 th . a trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open. a hillary victory, heaven forbid, would signal that our work will need to be underground. either way, our battle is just beginning. in future columns i will outline the way forward for traditional men.

"it was the rise of the davos class that sealed americas fate it was the rise of the davos class that sealed americas fate
hillary clintons embrace of neoliberalism was disastrous. the only answer now is to take on the billionaires
by naomi klein
november 10, 2016 "" information clearing house "" - "" the guardian "" - they will blame james comey and the fbi. they will blame voter suppression and racism. they will blame bernie or bust and misogyny. they will blame third parties and independent candidates. they will blame the corporate media for giving him the platform, social media for being a bullhorn, and wikileaks for airing the laundry.
but this leaves out the force most responsible for creating the nightmare in which we now find ourselves wide awake neoliberalism. that worldview  fully embodied by hillary clinton and her machine  is no match for trump-style extremism. the decision to run one against the other is what sealed our fate. if we learn nothing else, can we please learn from that mistake?
here is what we need to understand a hell of a lot of people are in pain. under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatisation, austerity and corporate trade, their living standards have declined precipitously. they have lost jobs. they have lost pensions. they have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening. they see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present.
at the same time, they have witnessed the rise of the davos class, a hyper-connected network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cosy with those interests, and hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous. success is a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness.
for the people who saw security and status as their birthright  and that means white men most of all  these losses are unbearable.
donald trump speaks directly to that pain. the brexit campaign spoke to that pain. so do all of the rising far-right parties in europe. they answer it with nostalgic nationalism and anger at remote economic bureaucracies  whether washington, the north american free trade agreement the world trade organisation or the eu. and of course, they answer it by bashing immigrants and people of colour, vilifying muslims, and degrading women. elite neoliberalism has nothing to offer that pain, because neoliberalism unleashed the davos class. people such as hillary and bill clinton are the toast of the davos party. in truth, they threw the party.
trumps message was all is hell. clinton answered all is well. but its not well  far from it.
neo-fascist responses to rampant insecurity and inequality are not going to go away. but what we know from the 1930s is that what it takes to do battle with fascism is a real left. a good chunk of trumps support could be peeled away if there were a genuine redistributive agenda on the table. an agenda to take on the billionaire class with more than rhetoric, and use the money for a green new deal. such a plan could create a tidal wave of well-paying unionised jobs, bring badly needed resources and opportunities to communities of colour, and insist that polluters should pay for workers to be retrained and fully included in this future. it could fashion policies that fight institutionalised racism, economic inequality and climate change at the same time. it could take on bad trade deals and police violence, and honour indigenous people as the original protectors of the land, water and air.
people have a right to be angry, and a powerful, intersectional left agenda can direct that anger where it belongs, while fighting for holistic solutions that will bring a frayed society together.
such a coalition is possible. in canada, we have begun to cobble it together under the banner of a peoples agenda called the leap manifesto , endorsed by more than 220 organisations from greenpeace canada to black lives matter toronto, and some of our largest trade unions.
bernie sanders amazing campaign went a long way towards building this sort of coalition, and demonstrated that the appetite for democratic socialism is out there. but early on, there was a failure in the campaign to connect with older black and latino voters who are the demographic most abused by our current economic model. that failure prevented the campaign from reaching its full potential. those mistakes can be corrected and a bold, transformative coalition is there to be built on.
that is the task ahead. the democratic party needs to be either decisively wrested from pro-corporate neoliberals, or it needs to be abandoned. from elizabeth warren to nina turner, to the occupy alumni who took the bernie campaign supernova, there is a stronger field of coalition-inspiring progressive leaders out there than at any point in my lifetime. we are leaderful, as many in the movement for black lives say.
so lets get out of shock as fast as we can and build the kind of radical movement that has a genuine answer to the hate and fear represented by the trumps of this world. lets set aside whatever is keeping us apart and start right now.

in a may interview with fbi agents, an executive with the denver contractor that maintained clintons private server revealed that an underling didnt bleach-clean all her subpoenaed emails, just ones he stored in a data file he used to transfer the emails from the server to clintons aides, who in turn sorted them for delivery to congress.

"the she-devil by patrick j. buchanan october 29, 2016 
should donald trump surge from behind to win, he would likely bring in with him both houses of congress. 
much of his agenda  tax cuts, deregulation, border security, deportation of criminals here illegally, repeal of obamacare, appointing justices like scalia, unleashing the energy industry  could be readily enacted. 
on new trade treaties with china and mexico, trump might need economic nationalists in bernie sanders party to stand with him, as free-trade republicans stood by their k-street contributors. 
still, compatible agendas and gop self-interest could transcend personal animosities and make for a successful four years. 
but consider what a hillary clinton presidency would be like. 
she would enter office as the least-admired president in history, without a vision or a mandate. she would take office with two-thirds of the nation believing she is untruthful and untrustworthy. 
reports of poor health and lack of stamina may be exaggerated. yet she moves like a woman her age. unlike ronald reagan, her husband, bill, and president obama, she is not a natural political athlete and lacks the personal and rhetorical skills to move people to action. 
she makes few mistakes as a debater, but she is often shrill  when she is not boring. trump is right hillary clinton is tough as a 2 steak. but save for those close to her, she appears not to be a terribly likable person. 
still, such attributes, or the lack of them, do not assure a failed presidency. james polk, no charmer, was a one-term president, but a great one, victorious in the mexican war, annexing california and the southwest, negotiating a fair division of the oregon territory with the british. 
yet the hostility clinton would face the day she takes office would almost seem to ensure four years of pure hell. 
the reason her credibility, or rather her transparent lack of it. 
consider. because the tapes revealed he did not tell the full truth about when he learned about watergate, richard nixon was forced to resign. 
in the iran-contra affair, reagan faced potential impeachment charges, until ex-security adviser john poindexter testified that reagan told the truth when he said he had not known of the secret transfer of funds to the nicaraguan contras. 
bill clinton was impeached  for lying. 
white house scandals, as nixon said in watergate, are almost always rooted in mendacity  not the misdeed, but the cover-up, the lies, the perjury, the obstruction of justice that follow. 
and here hillary clinton seems to have an almost insoluble problem. 
she has testified for hours to fbi agents investigating why and how her server was set up and whether secret information passed through it. 
forty times during her fbi interrogation, clinton said she could not or did not recall. this writer has friends who went to prison for telling a grand jury, i cant recall. 
after studying her testimony and the contents of her emails, fbi director james comey virtually accused clinton of lying. 
moreover, thousands of emails were erased from her server, even after she had reportedly been sent a subpoena from congress to retain them. 
during her first two years as secretary of state, half of her outside visitors were contributors to the clinton foundation. 
yet there was not a single quid pro quo, clinton tells us. 
yesterdays newspapers exploded with reports of how bill clinton aide doug band raised money for the clinton foundation, and then hit up the same corporate contributors to pay huge fees for bills speeches. 
what were the corporations buying if not influence? what were the foreign contributors buying, if not influence with an ex-president, and a secretary of state and possible future president? 
did none of the big donors receive any official favors? 
theres a lot of smoke and theres no fire, says hillary clinton. 
perhaps, but there seems to be more smoke every day. 
if once or twice in her hours of testimony to the fbi, grand jury or before congress, clinton were proven to have lied, her justice department would be obligated to name a special prosecutor, as was nixons. 
and, with the election over, the investigative reporters of the adversary press, pulitzers beckoning, would be cut loose to go after her. 
the republican house is already gearing up for investigations that could last deep into clintons first term. 
there is a vast trove of public and sworn testimony from hillary, about the server, the emails, the erasures, the clinton foundation. now, thanks to wikileaks, there are tens of thousands of emails to sift through, and perhaps tens of thousands more to come. 
what are the odds that not one contains information that contradicts her sworn testimony? cong. jim jordan contends that clinton may already have perjured herself. 
and as the full-court press would begin with her inauguration, clinton would have to deal with the syrians, russians, taliban, north koreans and xi jinping in the south china sea  and with bill clinton wandering around the white house with nothing to do. 
this election is not over. but if hillary clinton wins, a truly hellish presidency could await her, and us. the best of patrick j. buchanan tags",102,736266,fake

republicans are so far removed from reality that sean hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show, and nobody noticed the difference. 
cnn reported, the progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners. in this case, the fake news originated on a dubious site called your news wire, which publishes a mix of true, slanted and made-up news. then, like a game of telephone, by the time the story got to hannity, even the fake facts were wrong. 
some right-wing websites spread the story, which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop. the fake news eventually reached the gateway pundit, and to sean hannitys radio show. 
after spreading the fake news to millions of listeners, hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right, bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way, i was dealing with more important issues like hrc crimes and lies and how cnn has been colluding with the clinton campaign and cheating bernie sanders. 
hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from donald trump. 
how hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the right-wing media echo chamber works. nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the republican party belief has replaced fact. conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs, so that is what they provide. 
it doesnt matter if the confirmation is true. what matters is that the audience wants it to be true. 
sean hannity is pushing fake news, and he doesnt care. 
this is why there is such a disconnect between republicans and the rest of the country. republican voters are living in a fantasy land that donald trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the republican nomination.

hillary clinton could probably spend 24 hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting trumps hypocrisies. 
while trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new dc hotel, hillary clinton was winning more early votes in the state of florida. there are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. the first message is that democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting. the second message is that a few state polls have shown trump leading by a little in florida and gaining ground in new hampshire. 
it is possible that both of these stories are correct. democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some republicans may be coming back to trump. 
the important thing for hillary clinton and democrats is not to let up. democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. more polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter.

"the toronto star published an unauthorized database of things that will infuriate trump  addicting info  the knowledge you crave on november 6, 2016 340 pm  
trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isnt hard. getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that trump is the liar of liars is. same thing with bullying, but the new york times put together a spread of all the bullyish things trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. now, the toronto star s daniel dale has been tracking trumps lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . 
there are literally hundreds of lies in trumps speeches. theyre not all 100 unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. 
is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? tons of people claim hillary is a master liar, but first, shes actually more honest than most politicians. second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with trump the liar in any way, shape or form. 
the star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories clintons policies, wtf, daeshmiddle east, clintons record, african americansinner cities, the clintons corruption, rigged election, tradeeconomy, health care, trumps endorsements, refugeesimmigration, polls, obamas record, the campaign, russia, trumps record, taxes, sex assault allegations, clintons health and government corruption. 
they also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, the electoral system is rigged. of course, its rigged against him 
after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. rigged became his catchword. 
he claimed hillary clinton campaign workers hired thugs to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage clinton. he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia, chicago and st. louis  cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats. 
in greeley, colo., trump told his supporters if they dont trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. so, one did. trump supporter terri lynn rote, a 55-year-old from iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice. 
nobodys committing voter suppression and fraud quite like trumpsters and republicans. 
another is, muslims are risky. this touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from syria, who could be the great trojan horse of our time 
his claims that syrian refugees  99 per cent are muslim  are terrorists plays to the fears of the other, even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. and their numbers is nowhere near trumps claims  about 13,000 have been admitted to the united states in 2016. 
the polls favour trump. har de har har  trump only looks at the polls he likes, and theyre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. nevertheless 
it seems clear trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. this poll denialism gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests cnn. 
his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling  and perhaps even the vote itself. if supporters feel trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. 
on oct. 24, he said i won the last two debates, and every poll showed it. in fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. 
of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, trump was quick to promote  and exaggerate  those numbers. 
but these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. he has also falsely said on twitter, the failing nytimes reporters dont even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way! falsely said, by open borders, hillary means totally unlimited immigration. falsely said, hillarys plan includes an open border with the middle east. falsely called nbc anchor lester holt, the moderator of the first debate, a democrat. falsely said, wow, just came out on secret tape that crooked hillary wants to take in as many syrians as possible. falsely said the u.s. provided iran 150 billion as part of the nuclear deal. falsely said, in san bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many peoplemuslims have to report the problems when they see them. falsely asserted that clinton has been fighting isis her entire adult life. falsely said, all together, the hillary clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term. falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring nato obsolete because it doesnt cover terror; falsely suggested nato created an anti-terror position because of his comments. falsely claimed clinton didnt release cholesterol or ekg information falsely said sexual assault allegations against him have been largely debunked. falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser summer zervos, the one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense. falsely said i did not. i did not to clintons charge that he thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese. falsely said, i was against going into iraq. and its so well-documented. falsely said, our taxes are so high. just about the highest in the world. 
and so many more, just in the last six weeks! yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. if trump sees this, hell likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the papers lying, and continue to sell the myth that hes not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.

"7 things you need to know about trump and sex slave island 7 things you need to know about trump and sex slave island by amanda prestigiacomo may 9, 2016 
presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at hillary clinton when it comes to her husband's escapades. ""the kitchen sink,"" in this case, is jeffery epstein's sex slave island and president bill clintons ties to it . 
why wouldnt trump use this ammo? the answer is simple trump himself has ties to epstein, the billionaire democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having under-age sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls ""sex slave island."" 
here are seven connections between trump and epstein's sex slave endeavors that you need to know about 
1. trump himself has said that epstein is a lot of fun to be with, adding that he admired the sex offender's affinity for beautiful women on the younger side. 
""i've known jeff for fifteen years. terrific guy,'' trump once said about the convicted sex offender. ""he's a lot of fun to be with. it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do, and many of them are on the younger side. no doubt about it -- jeffrey enjoys his social life."" 
2. trump was named in epsteins little black book. 
epsteins  little black book  was stolen by a former employee in 2004. the book, nicknamed ""the holy grail"" by the employee, revealed the name of donald trump and listed 14 phone numbers including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to trump's security guard and houseman. 
3. trump has allegedly flown on epsteins private plane  a hot spot for under-age sex orgies. 
mark epstein, jeffrey's brother, testified in 2009 that trump flew on jeffrey's private jet at least once, reports vice news . meanwhile, message pads see below from epstein's palm beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by vice news indicate that trump called epstein twice in november of 2004. 
epsteins private boeing 727, according to one of his alleged victims, virginia roberts, was nicknamed the lolita express. roberts recalled unsavoury sex orgies on the private plane when she was just 15 years of age with epstein and his friends. 
4. both trump and epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an under-aged girl. 
radar online reports that a woman in california, identified as katie johnson, filed a 100 million lawsuit against trump on april 26, accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just 13 years old. 
johnson claims trump raped her when she was 13-years-old and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family, notes the independent uk . she claims the alleged abuse took place over a four-month period at underage sex parties held in new york city in 1994. epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats. 
trumps team adamantly denies the accusation, suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly no evidence the plaintiff actually exists. 
5. epstein admitted to knowing trump under oath, and curiously pled the fifth to trump attending sex parties with underage girls. 
back in 2010, epstein admitted to socializing with trump, but when a lawyer representing an under-aged victim of epsteins asked if he has ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of 18, epstein curiously pled the fifth. per vice news  q have you ever had a personal relationship with donald trump? a. what do you mean by ""personal relationship,"" sir? q. have you socialized with him? a. yes, sir. q. yes? a. yes, sir. q. have you ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of 18? a though i'd like to answer that question, at least today i'm going to have to assert my fifth, sixth, and 14th amendment rights, sir. 
6. at least one of epsteins underage sex victims was recruited from trumps mar-a-lago  which he frequented often. 
virginia roberts, an alleged victim of epsteins, ""was recruited to perform a massage for epstein while working as a 9-per-hour locker room attendant at mar-a-lago. 
roberts claims that epstein turned her into a sex slave and pimped her out to various friends, including england's prince andrew. over the years, the passengers on epstein's jet, she said, included a whole bunch of other girls, sometimes famous people, sometimes some politicians.'"" 
7. trump was subpoenaed in 2009 for his connection to epsteins under-age sex slave rings. trump has denied ever being served. 
in 2009, trump was subpoenaed in a case against epstein concerning victim virginia roberts. trump's attorney alan garten said that the subpoena ""never happened."" 
""there is no debate over what happened,"" said one of roberts' attorneys. ""i served mr. trump with a subpoena for deposition in 2009. he talked to me voluntarily, and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information. i can't imagine there being any dispute of any of this."" 
additionally, garten told vice news in january that mr. trump has ""no relationship"" with epstein other than the democratic donor frequenting trump's mar-a-lago. ""a lot of people hung out there, including jeffrey epstein,"" said garten. ""that is the only connection."" 
according to the evidence, however, the connections with epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that. tags",43,736272,real

when the womens health initiative study found that menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy suffered higher rates of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall harm, a call was made for safer alternatives. yes, estrogen has positive effects, the womens health initiative foundsuch as reducing menopausal symptoms and improving bone health, reducing hip fracture risk; but also negative effectsincreasing risk of blood clots in the heart, brain, and lungs, as well as breast cancer. 
so, ideally, to get the best of both worlds, wed need whats called a selective estrogen receptor modulator, something that has pro-estrogenic effects in some tissues like bone, but anti-estrogenic effects in other tissues like the breast. drug companies are trying to make them, but phytoestrogensnatural compounds in plants, like genistein in soybeans, that are structurally similar to estrogenappear to function as natural selective estrogen receptor modulators. how could something that looks like estrogen act as an anti-estrogen? 
the original theory for how soy phytoestrogens control breast cancer growth is that they compete with our own estrogens for binding to the estrogen receptor. as you drip more and more soy compounds on breast cancer cells in a petri dish, less and less actual estrogen is able to bind to them. so, the estrogen-blocking ability of phytoestrogens can help explain their anti -estrogenic effects. but, how do we then explain their pro -estrogenic effects on other tissues, like bone? how can soy have it both ways? 
the mystery was solved when we discovered there are two types of estrogen receptors in the body. and, so, how a target cell responds depends on which type of estrogen receptors they have. this may be the key to understanding the health-protective potential of soy phytoestrogensthe existence of this newly discovered estrogen receptor, named estrogen receptor beta, to distinguish it from the classic estrogen receptor alpha. and, unlike our bodys own estrogen, soy phytoestrogens preferentially bind to the beta receptors. 
if you have people eat about a cup of cooked whole soybeans, within about eight hours, genistein levels in the blood reach about 20 to 50 nanomolesthats how much is circulating throughout our body, bathing our cells. about half is bound up to proteins in the blood; so, the effective concentration is about half that. so, lets see what that means for estrogen receptor activation. 
this is the graph that explains the mysterious health benefits of soy foods. down around the effective levels youd get eating a cup of soybeans, theres very little alpha activationbut, lots of beta activation. so, now lets look at where each of these receptors are located in the human body. 
the way estrogen pills increase the risk of fatal blood clots is by causing the liver to dump out all these extra clotting factors. but, guess what? the human liver only contains alpha estrogen receptors, not beta receptors. and so, maybe, if we ate like 30 cups of soybeans a day, that could be a problem. but, at the kinds of concentrations one would get with just normal soy consumption, no wonder this is a problem with drug estrogensbut not soy phytoestrogens. 
the effects on the uterus appear also to be mediated solely by alpha receptorswhich is, presumably, why no negative impact has been seen with soy. so, while estrogen-containing drugs may increase the risk of endometrial cancer up to ten-fold, phytoestrogen-containing foods are associated with significantly less endometrial cancerin fact, protective effects for these types of gynecological cancers, in general. women who ate the most soy had 30 less endometrial cancer, and appeared to cut their ovarian cancer risk nearly in half. 
soy phytoestrogens dont appear to have any effect on the lining of the uterus, but still can dramatically improve menopausal symptoms. the kupperman index is like a compilation of all 11 of the most common menopausal symptoms. 
in terms of bone health, human bone cells carry beta estrogen receptors. so, we might expect soy phytoestrogens to be protective. and, indeed, they do seem to significantly increase bone mineral densityconsistent with population data suggesting high consumption of soy products is associated with increased bone mass. but, can they prevent bone loss over time? 
soy milk was compared to a transdermal progesterone cream. the control group lost significant bone mineral density in their spine over the two-year study period. but, the progesterone group lost significantly less, and the two glasses of soy milk a day group ended up actually better than when they started. this is probably the most robust study to date, comparing the soy phytoestrogen genistein to a more traditional hormone replacement drug regimen. in the spine, over a year, the placebo group lost bone density, but gained in the phytoestrogen and estrogen groups, and the same with the hip bones. 
the study clearly shows that the soy phytoestrogen prevents bone loss, and enhances new bone formation, in turn producing a net gain of bone mass. but, the only reason we care about bone mass is that we want to prevent fractures. is soy food consumption associated with lower fracture risk? yes. a significantly lower risk of bone fracture associated with just a single serving of soy a daythe equivalent of 5 to 7 grams of soy protein, or 20 to 30 milligrams of phytoestrogens. so, thats just like one cup of soy milkor, even better, a serving of a whole soy food, like tempeh or edamame, or the beans themselves. 
we dont have fracture data on soy supplements, though. so, if we seek the types of health benefits we presume asian populations get from eating whole and traditional soy foods, maybe we should look to eating those, rather than taking unproven protein powders or pills. 
is there anyone who should avoid soy? well, some people have soy allergies. a national survey found that only about 1 in 2,000 people report a soy allergy. thats 40 times less than the most common allergendairy milkand about ten times less than all the other common allergenslike fish, eggs, shellfish, nuts, wheat, or peanuts. please consider volunteering to help out on the site. close sources video sources",124,736283,fake
"the man who spoke softly but carried a big stick the man who spoke softly but carried a big stick bill federer remembers military philosophy of theodore roosevelt published 1 min ago print theodore roosevelt 
theodore roosevelt was born oct. 27, 1858. his wife and mother died on valentines day, feb. 14, 1884. he wrote in his diary the light has gone out in my life. depressed, he left to ranch in the dakotas. 
returning to new york, he entered politics and rose to assistant secretary of the navy. he resigned during the spanish-american war, organized the first volunteer cavalry, the rough riders, and captured cubas san juan hill. elected vice-president under william mckinley, he became americas youngest president in 1901. 
republican theodore roosevelt was the first president to invite an african-american, booker t. washington, to dine in the white house on oct. 16, 1901. a southern democrat newspapers condemned him it, as printed in the memphis scimitar the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the united states was committed yesterday by the president, when he invited a n- to dine with him at the white house. it would not be worth more than a passing notice if theodore roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a pullman car porter, but roosevelt the individual and roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light. 
in 1909, theodore roosevelt warned the thought of modern industry in the hands of christian charity is a dream worth dreaming. the thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining. the choice between the two is upon us. 
in 1917, the new york bible society had theodore roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket new testament  book of psalms given to world war i soldiers the teachings of the new testament are foreshadowed in micahs verse micah vi. 8 what more does the lord require of thee than to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy god? do justice; and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of germany and turkey, for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of moloch and beelzebub on this earth. love mercy; treat prisoners well, succor the wounded, treat every woman as if she was your sister, care for the little children, and be tender to the old and helpless. walk humbly; you will do so if you study the life and teachings of the saviour. may the god of justice and mercy have you in his keeping.  signed theodore roosevelt.

theodore roosevelt, in his book fear god and take your own part ny george h. doran co., 1916, wrote 
armenians  for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war  are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors, the turks, have not been pacifists but militarists. t. roosevelt, fear god, p. 61, 64 
armenians, have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the napoleonic warsthe wars of genghis khan and tamerlane in asia. yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged.  this course of national infamy  began when the last administration surrendered to the peace at-any-price people, and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties. individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milk-and-water invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of blood-and-iron. t. roosevelt, fear god, p. 111 
american eye-witness of the fearful atrocities, mr. arthur h. gleason new york tribune, nov. 25, 1915 serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish. now, the armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an old-time apache indian.  
even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heaped-up horrors of the past year and a half, the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation. let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation, and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds.  if this people through its government had not shirked its duty  we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of armenia. 
mass meetings on behalf of the armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them.  the principles of the peace-at-any-price men, of the professional pacifists  will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness.  this crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the armenians  must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the united states for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed.  the devastation of poland and serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenth-century europe.  
weak and timid milk-and-water policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the blood-and-iron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world. the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians. they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them, atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan. 
it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in thought, between right and the most hideous wrong, neutral between despairing and hunted people, people whose little children are murdered and their women raped, and the victorious and evil wrong-doers.  
i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities. i trust that they feel  that a peace obtained without  righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war.  
wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just, who put honor above safety, who are true to a lofty ideal of duty, who prepare in advance to make their strength effective, and who shrink from no hazard, not even the final hazard of war, if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness. when our people take this stand, we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesseson an even greater scale in armenia. t. roosevelt, fear god, pp. 377-383 
in his book fear god and take your part, 1916, theodore roosevelt wrote 
christianity is not the creed of asia and africa at this moment solely because the seventh century christians of asia and africa had trained themselves not to fight, whereas the moslems were trained to fight. christianity was saved in europe solely because the peoples of europe fought. 
if the peoples of europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and on up to and including the 17th century, had not possessed a military equality with, and gradually a growing superiority over the mohammedans who invaded europe, europe would at this moment be mohammedan and the christian religion would be exterminated. 
a contemporary of theodore roosevelt was the english author g.k. chesterton, who wrote of western christian civilization the collected works of g.k. chesterton volume xx, introduction and notes by james v. schall, ignatius press they seem entirely to forget that long before the crusaders had dreamed of riding to jerusalem, the moslems had almost ridden into paris. 
theodore roosevelt continued in fear god and take your part, 1916 wherever the mohammedans have had complete sway, wherever the christians have been unable to resist them by the sword, christianity has ultimately disappeared. from the hammer of charles martel to the sword of jan sobieski, christianity owed its safety in europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the mohammedan aggressor.

"whats goes around comes around, or how russia and the us are trading punches, by scott humor saker message no current saker messages. whats goes around comes around, or how russia and the us are trading punches, by scott humor 
this article was first published by the duran 
three years ago someones video parody of a  russian guys reaction  to a meteor falling over chelyabinsk went viral. russia today even included it into its reportage of how the russian dashcam videos become internet sensations 224. 
this 10 sec video had done more to project the toughness of russians than all the fireworks of vitaly churkins diplomatic rhetoric. hands down, churkin is brilliant and his speeches should be included into high school curriculum, however, due to peculiarities of the western supranational media, his oratorical talent remains largely unrecognized by a wider audience. yet, everyone remembers a video of a guy in a knitted cap, who just lowered a sun visor driving directly onto a collision path with a rapidly approaching celestial body. 
readers and commentators of the saker blog often express their frustration with the lack of immediate response to the western provocations from the russian government and society . why dont russias government respond by hitting them back hard and in kind? ask out readers. whereat we, russians, consider this to be our national character trait. rather than jumping nervously every time the west says boo! we keep steadfastly and resolutely moving forward despite of adversities. 
there is also a well calculated geopolitical dimension to this wait and observe stance chosen by the russias government every time washington comes up with a newly staged provocation. which is every monday, wednesday and friday, if i am not mistaken. washington here is being a working term to include pentagon, cia and also a slew of companies like

this is just a short snippet of a long list of willing participants in a division of a us military budget pie, which is now turned into a thriving and mushrooming industry of private constructors specializing in recognizance, intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis of sigint  finint in support of operations conus or oconus. 
we, of course, are mostly interested in operations that are being conducted oconus, which is outside of the continental us, also known as the rest of the world. in case you are wondering about the location of your country in relation to the us intelligence community. take the us military, plus the entirety of nato, some crafty old spy masters from britain, france, and germany, add to it hundreds of private and public enterprises, and you will understand where the plethora of false flag attacks, provocations, terror acts, civilian sabotage on the media, sports, kidnapping of russian citizens and other violations of the human rights of russians are coming from. 
in the last two weeks of october we watched a ukrainian civil airline dispatcher threaten to take down a civil aircraft from belarus. russia got pushed out of the un human rights council, after the generally proven-to-be-fake campaign of the white helmets , which are another of these private intelligence companies financed by nato members. 
we also were presented with the gruesome murder of one of the originators of so called  russian spring  in ukraine, known to the western audience as motorola. keeping in mind, of course, that the russian spring starting with the bolotnaya square protests, just like its predecessor the  arab spring , was engineered by western intelligence and military complexes. lets give credit where credit is due. 
all of these provocations, from big to small, from violent to ridiculous, all of them have one common goal, to draw the reaction of the russian government, to take its precious time, resources, and to disrupt its work. 
here comes the catch the more willing participants are being involved in designing and staging this torrid stream of provocations against russia, the less professional, less coordinated, and less convincing they are becoming. its exactly like with the famed musical cats which was perfectly choreographed on broadway, but watching it on a community theater stage would hurt your eyes in shame for the production crew and actors. 
by the fall of 2016, the saturation of provocative actions against russia has reached its critical stage. in other words, we had ceased reacting emotionally to them and have started analyzing them rationally. 
this explains the russian governments reaction to the multitude of recent provocative actions. a reaction that can be generally described as muted,low-key,hushed, and at least in one instance absent. 
knowing who or what is behind a provocation should warrant a type of response, if any. 
lets say, the justice department backtracks its perfidious demands for billions of dollars in fines arbitrarily imposed on deutsche bank, only after germany agrees to deploy its troops and tanks to the russian border. understandably, their move puts an adult population of russian into a sentimental mood summarized in lets finish the job our grandfather died doing. russias foreign ministry issues a warming statement, and the defense ministry moves a few troops closer to the western border, mirroring nato moves. the pentagon and cia issue memos to the all western media outlets stating the russian aggression. the western press copies these memos verbatim and propagates them in every nook and cranny of the free world. 
after that, the russian defense ministry releases information on successful testing of a new sarmat missile with some of its technical characteristics. youtube hosts several videos with detailed explanations of how it takes only two sarmats to destroy the east and west coasts of the us. they also specifically explain why sarmat is invincible to the western anti-missile systems. if you wonder how we got to this point, see the aforementioned information. 
everyone, privy to the latest russian military upgrades, which includes every youtube viewer, can see the russian government response to the attacks of the us banking system and wall street and the doj. 
we are witnessing a situation when hundreds of companies employing well over a million people who are trying to make themselves relevant in a crowded industry of war making, by producing torrents of events around the globe. they are the americans with gas cans setting fires around the globe, according to the memorable comparison made by rostislav ishchenko in his april 2015 article  what does putin want? 
he wrote  one can only guess who will be more effective  the americans with their gas can or the russians with their fire extinguisher?  
fire, however, dies quickly in the absence of oxygen. most of the anti-russian actions go unnoticed and just turn into white noise, but some manage to stand out in the news for a day or longer. in essence, they all vie for the russian government attention. maybe that gets them a yearend bonus and an annual contract renewal? 
thank you for your time,

"trump campaign admits they are trying to steal the election with voter suppression bloomberg reported  
to compensate for this, trumps campaign has devised another strategy, which, not surprisingly, is negative. instead of expanding the electorate, bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. we have three major voter suppression operations under way, says a senior official. theyre aimed at three groups clinton needs to win overwhelmingly idealistic white liberals, young women, and african americans. trumps invocation at the debate of clintons wikileaks e-mails and support for the trans-pacific partnership was designed to turn off sanders supporters. the parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by bill clinton and harassed or threatened by hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. and her 1996 suggestion that some african american males are super predators is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the pollsparticularly in florida. 
the effort was obvious, and according to the polling, it is failing. 
voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest harvard iop young voters poll. sanders started flocking towards clinton in august , and havent left, and early voting statistics show that african-american turnout is solid in swing states. 
the trump campaign has realized that they dont have enough supporters to win, so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states. 
however, for voter suppression efforts like trumps to be effective, the campaign must have a credible messenger. donald trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter, and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message. 
a voter suppression effort was expected from the trump campaign. what is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it. 
people on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by trumps public attack on democracy. 
the good news for all americans is that democrats are already fighting back , and the trump campaigns dark efforts to steal an election appear to be failing.",133,736264,real
"re trump and clinton have both assembled an army of lawyers to file lawsuits and contest the election results archives michaels latest video trump and clinton have both assembled an army of lawyers to file lawsuits and contest the election results by michael snyder, on november 1st, 2016 
what happens when you get thousands of lawyers involved in the craziest election in modern american history? unfortunately, we may be about to find out. we all remember the legal tug of war between al gore and george w. bush in 2000, and with each passing day it is becoming more likely that we could see something similar or even worse in 2016. in a brand new article entitled  clinton, trump prepare for possibility of election overtime , bloomberg discusses the armies of lawyers that clinton and trump are both assembling for this election. it would be nice if it was the american people that actually decided the outcome of this election, but if things are very close on november 8th it may come down to what the courts decide. 
traditionally, there has been a lot of pressure on the losing candidate to concede to the winning candidate before election night is over. 
however, in recent elections this has begun to change. i already mentioned what took place in the aftermath of the 2000 election, and in 2004 john kerry did not concede to george w. bush until the next morning. 
and looking back at the numbers from the 2012 election, it is clear that mitt romney should not have conceded the race to barack obama so early. there was evidence of election fraud in key battleground states such as ohio, pennsylvania, florida, colorado and virginia , and many people out there still believe that mitt romney would have won if the election would have been conducted fairly. 
so when donald trump says that he may not immediately concede the election if the results are tight, i think that there is wisdom in that. 
a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we may have had a situation where hillary clinton could have won by a landslide . but the fbi changed everything when they announced that they were renewing their investigation into hillary clintons emails. since that announcement, the poll numbers have been rapidly shifting and now trump has all of the momentum . 
for example, the abc newswashington post tracking poll had hillary clinton up by double digits not too long ago, but now it is showing a one point lead for trump . 
the race is very close at this point, and if the race to 270 electoral votes is razor tight on election night, i dont anticipate that either candidate will be eager to concede. we could see a prolonged legal battle ensue, and that could mean that we dont have a new president until long after election day is over. 
already, both campaigns are assembling large armies of lawyers. in fact, bloomberg is reporting that clinton already has thousands of lawyers that have donated their time to her campaign 
clinton is assembling a voter protection program that has drawn thousands of lawyers agreeing to lend their time and expertise in battleground states, though the campaign isnt saying exactly how many or where. it is readying election observers in florida, north carolina, pennsylvania, ohio, new hampshire, iowa, nevada and arizona to assess any concerns  including the potential for voter intimidation  and to verify normal procedures. 
the republican national lawyers association, which trains attorneys in battleground states and in local jurisdictions where races are expected to be close, aims to assemble 1,000 lawyers ready to monitor polls and possibly challenge election results across the country. hedge fund manager robert mercer, one of trumps biggest backers, has sunk 500,000 into the group, its biggest donation in at least four presidential elections, internal revenue service filings show. 
and most americans dont realize this, but reuters is reporting that the democrats have already filed election-related lawsuits in four key swing states 
democratic party officials sued republican presidential candidate donald trump in four battleground states on monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the nov. 8 election . 
in lawsuits filed in federal courts in pennsylvania, nevada, arizona and ohio, democrats argued that trump and republican party officials were mounting a campaign of vigilante voter intimidation that violated the 1965 voting rights act and an 1871 law aimed at the ku klux klan. 
meanwhile, the legal challenges for the clinton campaign continue to mount. the renewed investigation into hillary clintons mishandling of classified documents is just one of five fbi investigations that are currently looking into the conduct of clintons inner circle  
there are, in fact, not one but five separate fbi investigations which involve members of clintons inner circle or their closest relatives  the people at the center of what has come to be known as clintonworld. 
the five known investigations are into anthony weiner, huma abedins estranged husband sexting a 15-year-old; the handling of classified material by clinton and her staff on her private email server; questions over whether the clinton foundation was used as a front for influence-peddling; whether the virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether hillarys campaign chairmans brother did the same. 
despite everything that we already know about hillary, about half the country still plans to vote for her. 
if the american people willingly choose to elect the most corrupt presidential candidate in our history, it may be a sign that the events that i talk about in my new book are a lot closer than many people had originally been anticipating. 
but the good news is that a clinton victory is looking a whole lot less likely than it was just a week or two ago. 
could it be possible that the fbi has just delivered the  miracle  that donald trump desperately needed? 
americans are more emotionally invested in this presidential campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign since at least 1980. many of those that are backing trump will be emotionally devastated if he does not win on november 8th, but if trump does win we are likely to see the radical left throw a political temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. 
earlier today, i shared with my readers the amazing fact that donald trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old during his first full day in the white house if he wins the election. 
many conservatives are fully convinced that it is donald trumps destiny to be president. 
personally, i do not know what is going to happen. but with a race this close, it may be the courts that end up deciding who our next president is, and that is an outcome that none of us should want to see.

"david fahrenthold strikes, exposing donald trumps false philanthropy by hrafnkell haraldsson   512 pm trump sat on the stage, ""looking for all the world like an honored donor to the cause,"" and then got up and left without leaving a donation   
not only is donald trump a liar and a thin-skinned crybaby, but he is selfish, never spending his own money when he can spend somebody elses. this behavior was never more in evidence than the washington post s david fahrentholds account of a 1996 a ribbon-cutting held by the association to benefit children for a nursery school, when donald trump showed up, sat down to appear to be a great supporter, and then left without leaving a donation 
as sopan deb tweeted , 
 sopan deb sopandeb october 29, 2016 
frank and kathie lee gifford were big donors and it is no wonder gifford was so shocked by trumps presence. what had been exposed is that trumps life is a sham, a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not. 
as fahrenthold explains , 
for as long as he has been rich and famous, donald trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous. he spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public  even nationally televised  promises to give his own money away. it was, in large part, a facade. a months-long investigation by the washington post has not been able to verify many of trumps boasts about his philanthropy. 
that philanthropist isnt the real trump. the only person trump visibly cares about is donald trump. he uses his foundation to buy himself nice things, spending other peoples money for luxury items and collectibles. when he does make donations, it is again, because he gives no money to his own foundation, with other peoples money. 
fahrenthold says that the only donation of trumps own money the paper could find from the period of 2008 to today, is a 10,000 gift to the police athletic league of new york city, in 2009. 
for a man as rich as trump claims to be, 10,000 in eight years is nothing to brag about. not that this stops the monumental, deadbeat hypocrite that is donald trump from bragging anyway.",133,736267,real

"electronic voting machines caught switching trump votes to hillary trying to steal texas home  headlines  world news  electronic voting machines caught switching trump votes to hillary trying to steal texas 
if texas goes blue, you know something is seriously, seriously wrong 

from michael snyder  
is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? just a few weeks ago i issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from donald trump to hillary clinton. the odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight republican ticket. if hillary clinton is declared the winner of the state of texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that donald trump should lose that state. i have said that it will be the greatest miracle in u.s. political history if donald trump wins this election, but without the state of texas donald trump has exactly zero chance of winning. so those living down in texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. 
most americans dont realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. the state of ohio was considered to be the key to mitt romneys chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. 
unfortunately for romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. in a previous article, i included a quote from an ohio voter that had her vote switched from mitt romney to barack obama three times 
i dont know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me, said marion, ohio, voter joan stevens. 
stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for romney . 
i went to vote and i got right in the middle of romneys name, stevens told fox news, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the white house. 
she said that the first time she pushed romney, the machine marked obama. 
so she pushed romney again. obama came up again. then it happened a third time. 
maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times, she told fox news. 
and we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of ohio four years ago. 
for example, there were more than 100 precincts in cuyahoga county in which barack obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. 
if that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. but the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they arent even worth mentioning. 
and of course this didnt just happen in ohio. similar things were happening all over the country. 
the reason why i bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. if a fair vote had been conducted, romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. 
in wichita county, texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from trump to clinton that it made the local newspaper 
shortly after early voting booths opened monday in wichita county, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the democratic nominee, hilary clinton. none of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. a bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in arlington saw her votes switched. the post was shared more than 100,000 times monday. 
and paul joseph watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. one of the examples that he cited was a facebook post by lisa houlette of amarillo, texas 
gary and i went to early vote todayi voted a straight republican ticket and as i scrolled to submit my ballot i noticed that the republican straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clintonkaine box was also highlighted! i tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. i asked for help from one of the workers and she couldnt get it to go back either. it took a second election person to get the machine to where i could correct the vote to a straight ticket. be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! dont hesitate to ask for help. i had to have help to get mine changed. 
i dont know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when i read that. 
a similar incident was reported on facebook by shandy clark of arlington, texas 
hey everyone, just a heads up! i had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight republican. she checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to clinton! she reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. they commented that it had been happening. she is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. just want everyones vote to be accurate and count. check your vote before you submit! 
and of course they werent the only ones reporting vote switching. it turns out that lots of other texans have also experienced this phenomenon 
so is there a serious problem with the voting machines? 
according to breitbart, one county in texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots 
chambers county election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . 
chambers county clerk heather hawthorne told breitbart texas tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a software update on ess machines that otherwise omit one race when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. the texas 14 th court of appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. 
lets keep a very close eye on this. if the state of texas ends up in trumps column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. 
but if trump loses texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. 
despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. just the other day, wnd published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states. and devvy kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate in 2012 the highly respected pew research center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote close to 3 million registered in multiples states approximately 24 millionone of every eightvoter registrations in the united states are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate more than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state 
but despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. in fact, just today cnn came out with an article entitled poll most see a hillary clinton victory and a fair count ahead 
almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think hillary clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, donald trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new cnnorc poll. 
americans overall are more confident that the nations votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. 
unfortunately, cnn does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is gettingharder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. 
and the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the russians have made it up 
u.s. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to russias intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. 
the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the u.s. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the nov. 8 election. 
but hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. 
now that is a real conspiracy theory, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasnt so serious. 
during this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. 
the american people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. 
and lets watch the state of texas very carefully. if it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. on sale at sd bullion this week only",164,736263,fake
"breaking putin issues massive warning to the west russia unveiled a weapon capable of reaching united states territory recently, and on its heels, russian president vladimir putin said that the actions undertaken in washington are pushing russia into a nuclear arms race, according to zero hedge . 
zero hedge reported 
yesterday, russia reveals photos of a new highly advanced liquid fuelled heavy icbm capable of evading anti-missile defences and hitting us territory with 10 tonne nuclear payload. 
the makeyev design bureau  the designer of russias heavy liquid fuelled intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms  ie. of missiles capable of reaching us territory from russian territory, has published the first picture of russias new heavy sarmat icbm which is due to enter service shortly, probably in 2018. 
the makeyev design bureau also released this statement along with the picture of the sarmat icbm in accordance with the decree of the russian government on the state defence order for 2010 and the planning period 2012-2013, the makeyev rocket design bureau was instructed to start design and development work on the sarmat. in june 2011, the bureau and the russian ministry of defense signed a state contract for the sarmats development. the prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfil objectives of nuclear deterrent by russias strategic forces. 
as zero hedge noted, the sarmat has a specific goal of evading u.s. anti-ballistic missile systems that have been deployed in eastern europe. 
this is yet another reason why we need a president who understands the importance of modernizing and beefing up our military in these uncertain times. 
while the u.s. stays stuck in the 1960s and 1970s with our strategic deterrents, russia is working to upgrade their armory. the new sarmat missile is set to be ready to go in 2018. 
antiwars jason ditz had this to say about the situation between the u.s. and russia in regard to our respective military capabilities 
of course, the united states spends many, many times what russia does on its military, but the fact that russia has a proper military capable of defending the nation at all puts it in a total different category from most of americas recent wars, and russias massive nuclear arsenal makes it clear this is one war which, if the us launches it, they wont be able to win outright.

iranian parliament speaker ali larijani says the european union can play a significant role in the settlement of the syrian crisis and the campaign against terrorism. 
larijani made the remarks in a meeting with visiting finnish president sauli niinistö in tehran on wednesday. 
he said that iran supports political solutions to crises in the middle east, including the conflict in syria, while some extra-regional players as well as regional sponsors of terrorist groups sabotaged diplomatic solutions through adopting wrong approaches. 
the top iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world. 
unfortunately, military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorism have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities, larijani said. 
he also blamed the extremist and deviated ideology of wahhabism for the spread of terrorism in the region, stressing that neither sunnis nor shias support terrorist or extremist acts. 
elsewhere in his remarks, larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between tehran and helsinki. 
the finnish official, for his part, called for the further promotion of ties between his country and iran. 
he also expressed regret about terrorist attacks in afghanistan, iraq and syria and the lack of a political will to end the conflicts.

"nato announces largest troop deployments against russia since cold war nato announces largest troop deployments against russia since cold war by alex lantier
november 09, 2016 "" information clearing house "" - "" wsws "" - nato will place hundreds of thousands of troops on alert for military action against russia in the coming months, top nato officials told the times of london on monday.
the us-led military alliance is planning to speed up the mobilization of forces numbering in the tens of thousands and, ultimately, hundreds of thousands and millions that are to be mobilized against russia. beyond its existing 5,000-strong emergency response force, nato is tripling its incumbent response force to 40,000 and putting hundreds of thousands of troops on higher alert levels.
the times wrote, sir adam west, britains outgoing permanent representative to nato, said he thought that the goal was to speed up the response time of up to 300,000 military personnel to about two months. at present a force of this size could take up to 180 days to deploy.
nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg said, we are addressing what we call the follow-on forces. there are a large number of people in the armed forces of nato allies. we are looking into how more of them can be ready on a shorter notice. according to the times , stoltenberg explained that nato is looking broadly at methods for improving the readiness of many of the alliance's three million soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.
the target of these deployments, the largest since the dissolution of the soviet union by the stalinist bureaucracy and the end of the cold war a quarter century ago, is russia.
we have seen a more assertive russia implementing a substantial military build-up of many years, tripling defence spending since 2000 in real terms; developing new military capabilities; exercising their forces and using military force against neighbours, stoltenberg said. we have also seen russia using propaganda in europe among nato allies and that is exactly the reason why nato is responding. we are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the cold war.
these statements show how nato planning for a horrific war against russia has continued behind the backs of the people throughout the us presidential election campaign. military deployments and war preparations by the pentagon and the general staffs of the various european countries are set to go ahead, moreover, whatever the outcome of the election in the united states and those slated for 2017 in the european nato countries.
stoltenberg's vague attack on russian propaganda in europe is an allusion to the instinctive opposition to war that exists in the european and international working class and popular distrust of the anti-russian propaganda promoted by nato officials like stoltenberg and west.
last year, a pew poll found broad international opposition to nato participation in a conventional war against russia in eastern europe, even in a scenario that assumes russia started the conflict. under these hypothetical conditions, 58 percent of germans, 53 percent of french people, and 51 percent of italians opposed any military action against russia. opposition to war in the poll would doubtless have been higher had pollsters mentioned that nato's decision to attack russian forces in eastern europe could lead to nuclear war.
this opposition is rooted in deep disaffection with the imperialist middle east wars of the post-soviet period and the memory of two world wars in europe in the 20th century. the arguments stoltenberg presented against it are politically fraudulent.
the primary threat of military aggression and war in europe comes not from russia, but from the nato countries. over the past 25 years, the imperialist powers of nato have bombed and invaded countries in central asia, the middle east and africa. within europe, they bombed serbia and kosovo in the balkan wars of the 1990s, pushed natos borders hundreds of miles to the east, and backed a violent, fascist-led putsch to topple a pro-russian government in ukraine in 2014.
the aggressive character of nato policy emerged once again last friday, when nbc news reported that us cyber warfare units had hacked key russian electricity, internet and military networks. these are now vulnerable to attack by secret american cyber weapons should the us deem it necessary, nbc stated.
russian officials denounced the activities highlighted in the report and the obama white house's silence on the matter. russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said, if no official reaction from the american administration follows, it would mean state cyber terrorism exists in the us. if the threats of the attack, which were published by the us media, are carried out, moscow would be justified in charging washington.
the geo-strategically disastrous consequences of the stalinist bureaucracy's dissolution of the soviet union and restoration of capitalism in eastern europe are ever more apparent. with nato troops or proxy forces stationed in a geographic belt extending from the baltic republics to poland, ukraine and romaniaeither a short distance from or on russia's bordersnato is now poised for a major war against russia that could escalate into a nuclear conflagration.
an examination of stoltenbergs remarks shows that natos plans are not defensive preparations to counter a sudden conventional invasion of europe by the russian army. in such a scenario, russian tank columns would overrun the few thousand or tens of thousands of troops in natos various emergency response forces, depriving the broader ranks of nato follow-up forces the 60 to 180 days they need to mobilize.
rather, the plan for mobilizing successive layers of follow-on forces is intended to allow nato to threaten russia in a crisis situation by gradually bringing to bear more and more of its collective military strength, which, although split between 28 member states, outweighs that of russia. russia's population of 145 million is far smaller than that of the nato countries, at 906 million.
the aggressive character of natos agenda is illustrated by a report issued last month by the cia-linked rand corporation think tank on the military situation in the baltic republics of lithuania, latvia and estonia. the small military forces nato has posted in the baltic republics, rand wrote, are inviting a devastating war, rather than deterring it. they calculated that russian forces, if they actually invaded, could overrun these countries in approximately 60 hours.
on this basis, the think tank called for launching a vast nato military build-up in the baltic republics, virtually at the gates of st. petersburg. it wrote that it would take a force of about seven brigades, including three heavy armored brigadesadequately supported by air power, land-based fires, and other enablers on the ground and ready to fight at the onset of hostilities to prevent the rapid overrun of the baltic states. this would cost the nato countries 2.7 billion each year.
as the nato countries intensify their threats against russia, there are increasingly bitter conflicts among the nato imperialist powers themselves. italian prime minister matteo renzi bluntly opposed new sanctions on russia as called for by washington at last month's european union summit in brussels, and there are deepening tensions between germany and the united states as officials in berlin and paris call for an independent eu military.
prospects of increased us-led military provocations against russia are sharpening tensions within europe. in an article titled whether clinton or trump wins, for germany things will get uncomfortable, german news magazine der spiegel warned of the long-term implications of an aggressive us-led policy against russia, which it assumed would continue regardless which of the two candidates secured the white house.
the magazine wrote, the motto will be if you want nuclear us protection from putin, you must either pay us more money or re-arm yourself.

"moronic trump campaign thinks reopened clinton email investigation will save them the trump campaign is so desperate that they are openly celebrating the reopening of the fbis investigation into hillary clintons emails. 
trump campaign manager kellyanne conway tweeted a great day in our campaign just got even better. fbi reviewing new emails in clinton probe cnnpolitics  
 kellyanne conway kellyannepolls october 28, 2016 
the problem with the idea that the emails will save donald trump and the republican party is that clinton was beating trump while the fbi did their first investigation into her emails. clinton has led trump all through the congressional hearings into her emails. she led trump throughout the fbi investigation into her emails. clinton won the democratic nomination with her emails being a story. 
the point is that hillary clintons emails arent a big issue to the majority of voters. the people who arent republicans in this election dont care about her emails. 
when compared to trump sexually assaulting women, not paying federal income taxes, and being sued in two states for fraud, the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time. 
there has also never been a shred of proof that hillary clinton did anything wrong. 
republicans cant get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy. 
hillary clinton is facing donald trump in this election, and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day.

"police turn in badges rather than incite violence against standing rock protesters at least two police officers turned in their badges today after acknowledging that attacking peaceful protesters is not what they signed up for. 
via trueactivist 

it should be evident if youre following news concerning the standing rock protests in north dakota that tension continues to escalate between protesters supporting the standing rock sioux tribe and riot police. the big deal? a four-state dakota access pipeline which threatens to uproot sacred burial ground, poison the missouri river, and make null an 1881 treaty ensuring the property belongs to the standing rock sioux tribe.
in addition to being maced and beaten with batons, activists have been tased and even shot with rubber bullets. despite the violence taking place, tribal leaders continue to ask all water protectors to maintain peaceful relations and rely on prayer as the only weapon used to halt construction of the dapl.
after watching videos of the mass arrests and beating that have taken place, many have asked how those employed by the state can continue to terrorize weaponless protesters. surely, some form of cognitive dissonance must be taking place? for some, most likely, and thats undoubtedly what inspired at least two officers to turn in their badges today. according to an activist named redhawk, there have been reports of at least two officers turning in their badges after acknowledging that the battle against the american people is not what they signed up for.
on facebook, the activist wrote
you can see it in some of them, that they do not support the police actions. we must keep reminding them they are welcome to put down their weapons and badge and take a stand against this pipeline as well.

"democrats are going back into florida with millions of dollars to retire marco rubio by jason easley   535 pm a democratic super pac is injecting millions of dollars into the florida senate race in a bid to retire sen. marco rubio.   
a democratic super pac is injecting millions of dollars into the florida senate race in a bid to retire sen. marco rubio. 
cnn reported that harry reids super pac, the senate majority pac, is injecting millions of dollars into the florida senate race to help rep. patrick murphy in his bid to defeat marco rubio this race is closing, spokesman shripal shah told cnn. voters know that marco rubio is only looking out for himself and theyre going to hold him accountable for pushing a self-serving agenda at their expense. 
this afternoon senate majority pac made a seven-figure transfer to floridians for a strong middle class, a florida based super pac supporting patrick murphys campaign. the move comes hours after senate majority pac announced a record fundraising haul  19.3 million  covering the pre-general reporting period october 1st thru 19th that will be filed with the fec today. 
democrats have been divided over the strategy for handling the florida race. sen. chuck schumer canceled future spending in florida to direct resources into senate races in north carolina, indiana, and missouri. reid sees an opportunity to knock out rubio and eliminate him from presidential contention in 2020. 
the retiring senate democratic leader has been loudly urging democrats to spend big in florida to end rubios national political career. 
according to harry enten at fivethirtyeight , the polling suggests that pulling out of florida is probably the right move for democrats, but with cash to burn and a shot to beat rubio, there is a case to be made for more spending.

our country is at a crossroads. never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. one road, the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. the other, favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward free-market capitalism. 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. in this system they control the lions share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. in this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. as the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hard-earned money he or she spends. yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the free-market system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. no, it isnt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard. there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around 85,000 a year in some parts of the country. the democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. 
ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. 
unfortunately, this so-called living wage will destroy jobs. it will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness. 
this, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. 
wages have remained flat for far too long, but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes. they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as weve seen in obamacare, there is a large outcry. thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut. 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. our benevolent government will take care of us. they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. and if we dont get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. under president hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. what a country! 
if we dont reach our goals, everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isnt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke? how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses? they never talk about that. 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said, the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money. 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. the other offers a free lunch.

"tape reveals bill clinton urging mistress to deny he helped her get job recorded audio of a series of phone conversations between former president bill clinton and his mistress, gennifer flowers, have recently surfaced.
in one of the recordings, from 1991, clinton, then governor of arkansas, is heard advising flowers to deny any claims that he had aided her in getting a state job.
if they ever asked if youd talked to me about it, you can say no, he says.

at the time of the recording, the media had been asking many questions about clintons affair with flowers and she was worried that the barrage of questions could inevitably lead to inquires into how she landed her job as an administrative assistant for the arkansas appeal tribunal.
 
a complaint was being filed by an anonymous woman who felt that flowers relationship with clinton kept her from getting the job when, the woman claimed, she was more qualified.
in the audio, clinton is heard coaching flowers on how best to deal with the woman and subsequent questions that may arise.
the sections of the audio recordings dealing with the state job were given to the news media in 1992. this came just one day after clinton had appeared on 60 minutes with his wife, hillary  the current democratic presidential nominee  blatantly denying any romantic relationship with flowers.

this is my current situation. a pimply, bleeding, sore face. it doesn't look that bad, but it feels pre y bad. my skin will always be a journey in itself, i don't think i will ever be one of those girls who feels completely okay without makeup, but that's fine. even when my skin is at its best, which does happen sometimes, when i don't have any big angry pimples and everything looks quite smooth, i'm still a little self conscious.

lomas goes on to explain that while she lacks confidence in her skin, she doesn't lack confidence in herself. learning the difference, she says, was the key to feeling better about her flaws 
i've come a long way from the girl who used to cry every single night about the way her skin looked. these days my skin is just a minor downer for me sometimes. this post is just to show you all that you should be confident despite your little flaws.

"unprecedented bond dumping means u.s. dollar collapse ahead in collapse , economy  business , multimedia in the following interview, elijah johnson and silver doctors bring you the latest interview with someone we havent heard from in a while, dr. jim willie. to begin the financial portion of the interview, elijah begins by asking dr. willie about the unprecedented bond dumping by china and saudi arabia, and of course what elijah is referring to is how several weeks ago the markets witnessed never before seen numbers when 28 billion in u.s. treasuries were dumped one week, followed by another 23 billion a week or so later. 
consider the massive sell-offs just further evidence in a long line of existing examples regarding why the days of the u.s. dollar as the world reserve currency are numbered. our creditors are aware that the fed has been engaged in non-stop printing of money out of thin air, and even though the short-term effect has been the propping up of u.s. treasury prices, our creditors know history, something americans seems to pay no attention to. our creditors know that just like other countries who have engaged in the same kinds of reckless monetary policy in the past, eventually when the qe printing money out of thin air, is removed, hyperinflation will set in, and there will be massive devaluation of the same treasuries that were artificially propped up for so long. most creditors expect the qe to be shut off the moment this u.s. election is over, because unlike uninformed american voters, our creditors know that in addition to his role in allowing the largest case of massive voter fraud in america history to take place on his watch, captain transparency in the white house has made sure his loyal servant at the fed, janet yellen, has continued committing massive financial fraud at the fed at the same time. all of these actions by the u.s. result in what dr. willie refers to as psychological damage not just to the full faith and credit of the united states dollar, but to the united states itself. creditors of u.s. debt are watching a never before seen transition in the u.s. to a system of pure corruption, undermining any faith they might have had in the dollar, and giving them every reason in the world to want to distance them from the u.s. dollar. dr. willie explains that any perceived moral authority the u.s. once might have had is long gone. among other things, the world learned not long ago through a shocking revelation by wikileaks that obama and hillary not only knew of funds being used to provide isis our enemy, with weapons during a time of war, the world has now seen that barack obama and hillary allowed it. with almost a week until the official election we have heard tremendous stories of voter fraud including stories revealing as many as 2020 examples of machines switching votes from trump to hillary, we know the polls have been massively rigged, and thanks to a national media as corrupt and dishonest and those they are tasked with watching over, dr. willie briefly mentions millennials who were recently highlighted on the steven colbert show expressing their excitement that obamacare premiums are doubling in some states. the level of stupidity that is coming out of liberal indoctrination centers known as public schools or universities, where graduates have no ability to exercise critical thinking skills, is exactly why 20 college graduates are now living with their parents or grandparents, and michael snyder explains below. expect that number to keep climbing considerably, particularly with a clinton presidency. michael snyder writes in america today, more than 60 million people live in multi-generational households. that number is so large that it may seem difficult to believe, but the truth is that vast numbers of young adults have had to move back in with their parents and grandparents in recent years due to the deteriorating economy . millions of our young people cannot find decent jobs once they leave school, and millions of them are absolutely overwhelmed by debt. of course some of them are just lazy, but whatever the reason it is undeniable that multi-generational households are on the rise. according to the pew research center , 12 percent of the u.s. population was living in multi-generational households back in 1980. today, that number is up to 19 percent. that means nearly one out of every five u.s. adults now live with their parents or their grandparents. one of the big culprits, of course, is student loan debt.",195,736272,fake

as a nation of laws, the american people should, and most likely do, demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the countrys largest investigative agency. one thing every american who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is. as an occasional print journalist, this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons. the scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney. 
apparently, the federal bureau of investigation fbi director james comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten; if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution. however, as it turns out mr. comey did get a memo  from the department of justice in the form of a warning . but because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to house republicans and not the department of justice, he ignored the doj counsel to do a solid for the gop less than two weeks before a presidential election. 
since mr. comey cant keep it investigations in his pants, or follow long-standing law enforcement and investigative rules, or take heed to justice department warnings, it is incumbent on president barack obama to summarily fire f.b.i. director james comey on the morning of wednesday, november 9th 2016. why should president obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the f.b.i.? so as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election; something fbi director james comey is apparently incapable of comprehending. 
this incident, just like the one in july when comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in july, and then publicly testified before congress to discuss the bureaus ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent; it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason. first, as mentioned above, not only did the department of justice warn mr. comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all, much less so close to an election, that warning came after the f.b.i. contacted the doj about going public with information the bureau admitted it had not yet even  reviewed . that was precisely what comey told his republican buddies in a letter to congress. 
in the letter , comey told congressional republicans that the f.b.i. really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to hillary clintons private email server, but what he did  know  for sure was that they  appeared  to be pertinent; even though his agency, the f.b.i. had not yet examined them. so the real pertinent question is why did mr. comey publicly inform congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasnt attempting to inject some  partisan drama  into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome? 
it is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from mr. comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in july to discuss the agencys finding on an investigation before the doj weighed in, or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan republican committee in congress. and no, it was not to defend the bureaus decision not to bring criminal charges against clinton; only a brain-dead moronic imbecile or partisan republican hack would begin to think that the f.b.i., c.i.a., local sheriff, or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation. for dogs sake even the 1960s fictional sheriff andy griffiths hapless deputy barney fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorneys office or department of justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law. 
according to mr. comey, who was  stung by criticism from both democrats and republicans  as well as former prosecutors and  appeared to be on the defensive ;  he felt obligated to inform republicans in congress  even though the bureau really didnt  know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.  likely because he knew they did not come from hillary clinton. as an aside, sarah jones has a nifty summary of the email caper the f.b.i. uncovered while investigating  serial sexter  anthony weiners laptop computer, ipad, and cellphone. and no, anthony weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate hillary clinton. 
it doesnt matter what kind of pathetic excuse comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation, it is virtually impossible to believe he didnt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting house republicans. as interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee, donna brazile said,  the f.b.i. has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters  even the faintest appearance of using the agencys power to influence our election is deeply troubling . ms. brazile demanded more information from comey and didnt conceal her concern over comey interfering with the election. 
mr. comey claimed, very conveniently one might add, that as a died-in-the-wool republican he contributed to john mccain and willard romneys presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 respectively, that he is not a republican now. that was his remark back in july when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the department of justice, not the federal bureau of investigation. it was a suspicious  confession  in july and it is nearly impossible to believe in late october after he ignored department of justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just 11 days before an election and before the bureau had even reviewed anything. 
comey cannot possibly remain as head of the federal bureau of investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation. if comey hadnt taken heat for his reveal in july, and a warning from the justice department this week, then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention. but since he was warned, and is not an inept law enforcement official, it is more than reasonable to believe that comeys most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on november 9, 2016. because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move; something a sap like james comey might try, but not president obama.",133,736268,real

"cars that broke bad eric peters autos october 31, 2016 
automotive good ideas gone bad range far and wide  whether its a classic fail like the exploding pintos of the early 70s  or a late-model train wreck like the pontiac aztek. 
here are ten automotive atrocities that will be remembered for as long as the warranty claims and class-action lawsuits linger 
 the entire american motors corp. amc lineup  
from dreadful dreadnoughts like the malformed matador to demented detritus like the gremlin and pacer, no other automaker ever managed to build such a seemingly endless conga line of bizarre, poorly conceived and often, poorly built cars within such a short span of time from the late 1960s to the early-mid 1970s. 
only bankruptcy eventually succeeded in stopping the madness. exceptions deserving of a kind word include the javelin and amx, which were decent efforts hobbled by amcs perpetual lack of adequate development funds. 
 chryslers lean burn engines  
while honda was developing highly efficient combustion chambers to lower engine emissions via engineering advances such as the cvcc cylinder head which allowed the cars to meet federal exhaust emissions standards without catalytic converters chrysler was duct-taping its v8s with leaned-out carburetors that mainly made them even harder to start than they were before  and prone to stalling in the middle of busy intersections. 
in addition, you also got gelded performance and terrible gas mileage. 
now you know why rich, corinthian leather never made a comeback. 
 general motors diesel v8  
imagine a luxury car that was both slow and inefficient as well as prone to early and catastrophic engine failures and you have a taste of the bitter flavor that was the diesel-powered oldsmobiles and cadillacs of the late 70s and early 80s. 
these diesel engines were actually converted gas engines, which contrary to the myth wasnt the problem. poor quality control was. 
the resultant debacle not only soured an entire country on the otherwise perfectly sound concept it helped hustle oldsmobile to the boneyard of automotive has-beens and nearly killed off cadillac, too. 
 the sterling  
japanese automakers rarely screw the pooch, but this was an exception. 
back in the late 1980s, in collusion with british car maker land rover, acura legends were re-sold as british sterling 825s and 827s. the alliance was as enduring as the hitler-stalin non-aggression pact  and just as awkward. parts for these cars  especially interior pieces  are all but impossible to find. dealer support is nonexistent. resale values are lower than current highs for well-worn yugos. 
if truman had had another bomb left to drop, the childhood home of the dude who would grow up to create sterling would have been a worthy target. 
 pontiac fiero  
a great idea ruined by upper management skinflints and con men  who thought it would be slick take chevette underthings front suspension, engine and put them in a car that looked sporty and then charge the suckers top dollar. 
first-year sales were great  until the word got out. they then nose-dived into the ground like the air france concorde, forcing the cars cancellation just four years after it came out. just in time to hand over the entire market for a car of this type to mazda , which brought out the miata a year after the fiero was sent to the crusher. the best of eric peters tags eric peters   is an automotive columnist and author of automotive atrocities and road hogs 2011. visit his website copyright  2016 eric peters",102,736268,fake

"world war 3 news russia spits on us as conflict ignites, putin prepares to strike - morning news usa comment 
russia is reportedly planning to attack as the united states remains distracted on election day. according to reports, vladimir putins war fleet could launch a bloody attack on syria within 24 hours. will things turn uglier? 
russia may be taking advantage as the rest of america continues to be on their toes on its presidential elections. according to reports, vladimir putins war fleet is expected to launch a massive cruise missile attack on syria in just 24 hours. 
the coming hours present a perfect opportunity for russia as war crimes and no fly zones have been pushed aside as america battles it out on hilary clinton and donald trump. russia spits on us as conflict ignites 
the united states called out russia for its bombing campaign in the disputed region. in fact, washington also threatened to impose sanctions on the country repeatedly because of what john kerry referred to as the largest of humanitarian disasters. 
also read russia fires at united states as tensions escalate 
according to daily stars report , experts have warned about the conflict that could ensue should the tensions between russia and the u.s. continue to rise. 
in another report from the voice of america , russias defense ministry officials clarified on tuesday that the new strikes against islamic state terror group will be targeting the outskirts of the northern city of aleppo and would ensue in the next few hours. however, an unidentified source told voa that the possible strikes were in support of the regime of syrian president bashar al-assad. 
the comments from the russian ministry of defense suggest they are more interested in the world seeing russias naval capabilities in action than the world seeing russia live up to its word, the official said. an escalation would make it harder to resolve the brutal civil war in syria and raise more doubts about russias commitment.

the ap-gfk poll has hillary clinton leading donald trump by 14 points nationally 51-37, the ap-gfk poll finds that clinton has secured the support of 90 percent of likely democratic voters, and also has the backing of 15 percent of more moderate republicans. just 79 percent of all republicans surveyed say they are voting for their partys nominee. 
earlier in the day, two bloomberg polls that had trump leading florida by 2 points, and cutting clintons new hampshire lead in half gave republicans a bit of hope that the presidential election might be tightening, but the reality is that voting is already underway in 37 states. there are very few undecided voters remaining. 
outside of tracking polls, donald trump hasnt had a polling lead since july . besides his brief july bump, trump hasnt led clinton in national polling since may. what the media and republicans dont want to tell you is that this presidential election has been remarkably consistent. 
there is nothing in the polling to suggest that the election is tightening, or that trump has significantly improved his odds of winning.

"comment on leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police by fungirl91 home  badge abuse  leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police matt agorist august 31, 2016 97 comments 
memos and documents published by dcleaks continue shedding light on billionaire globalist george soros and his progressive organization, open society foundations osf. due to their poor digital curation, however, the leaks are hard to comb through which is leading to the information slowly trickling out. the latest of the documents reveals the billionaires attempt to organize a national movement to create a federalized police force. 
the document shows that osf saw the killings of mike brown, eric garner, walter scott, and freddie gray as an opportunity to implement this mission of federal police guidelines. osf, according to the documents, then held a meeting titled, police reform how to take advantage of the crisis of the moment and drive long-term institutional change in police-community practice. 
the memo further documents that soros-financed groups and personalities influenced a task force on 21st century policing, created by president obama. last may, the task force released a final report consisting of 60 recommendations recommending protocol to local departments on how to modify policing practices. 
the information is from a 61-page report of an open society u.s. programs board meeting that took place in new york city in may of last year. 
states the board meeting document 
the federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives. in addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the presidential taskforce, the white house recently launched the policing data initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust, voice, and solutions to improve community policing. the department of justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the national initiative for building community trust and justice, which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice, reduce implicit bias, and support racial reconciliation. 
we are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best usp can use this moment to create a national movement. we have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform, including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work, and opportunities for collaboration. as we proceed, we will engage the funder network we helped to establish, the executive alliance on men and boys of color, which now includes forty foundations. 
u.s. programs usp is a part of osf with the stated mission of working to further a vibrant democratic society in which all people can meaningfully participate in its civic, economic, and political life. 
according to the above excerpt, usp was thinking of ways to capitalize on police killings to create a national movement to implement their agenda. 
the think tank also raises the question of how to properly steer the ostensible grassroots organizations, such as black lives matter, to achieve usp goals. 
the events of the past several months have understandably led to a wide range of activities, including a variety of advocacy efforts, to respond to the significant challenges in policing that have been exposed and the opportunity to promote meaningful and lasting change. for example, organized under the banner of the civil rights coalition on police reform, organizations like the lawyers committee for civil rights under the law, lcchr, and ldf are advocating for federal reform efforts with a particular emphasis on data collection and transparency and, as noted above, 35 effecting federal funding streams. a variety of other national advocacy organizations, including grantees advancement project, policylink, the center for popular democracy and the aclu are working to provide advocates with toolkits and resources to help their organizing efforts. locally based groups such as the ohio student association, the organization for black struggle, the asian law caucus, and the aclu of new jersey, to name a few, are advocating for specific reforms at the city and state levels. another layer of grassroots and youth-oriented groups like freedom side, ferguson action, black lives matter and million hoodies movement for justice are also advocating for specific reforms. the range of efforts underway raises a number of questions and concerns about capacity, the need for coordination and the appropriate prioritization of policy objectives, among others, which we will discuss in the policing portion of the meeting. 
while the intentions of reforming police in america seem noble, the very idea of a soros-led initiative is chilling. 
another memo, leaked earlier this month, showed the billionaire was potentially funding the black lives matter movement , to the tune of 650,000. now, as todays memo shows, we know why. 
as the free thought project has pointed out many times before, soros has been exposed literally manipulating the world. 
earlier this month, in an email found within the wikileaks hillary clinton archive, with the subject unrest in albania, soros makes clear to clinton that two things need to be done urgently. he then directs the secretary of state to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on prime minister berisha and appoint a senior european official as mediator. revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power, soros then provides secretary of state clinton with three names from which to choose. unsurprisingly, clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by soros  miroslav lajcak. 
this is standard operating procedure for soros. anyone familiar with the history of the soros open society foundations in eastern europe and around the world since the late 1980s, will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracy-building projects in poland, russia, or ukraine in the 1990s allowed soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth, according to the new eastern outlook . 
soros-affiliated organizations are deeply connected to numerous color revolutions, such as the arab spring, and a number of other uprisings across the world. they have been intimately involved in the coup that took place in ukraine, and subsequent ratcheting up of cold war tensions with russia. 
as these leaked memos and emails prove, the united states is nothing more than one of soros pawns.

i think its time to end local policing for profit. the police force should exist to protect and serve, not to fill the county coffers. we need direct oversight of the police, the end of the power of their union to protect bad cops and the end of corrupt local government. the downside is the federal government is so big and spread out that they can barely keep track of our military assets. we can count on them to institute a public facing, qualifications search for candidates. randy pitts

now its easy to see why soros was paying them to act out ricialove 
as a black woman, heres what i want to knowwith all that money that blm receives.what the heck do they do?!?! anna miller 
george soros is a criminal subversive who has created havoc on a global level and for a long time. his crimes are well-documented. he is the billonaire who broke the british pound in 1992. he is responsible for funding numerous revolutions including the coup in ukraine, toppling a democratically elected president and moving nato closer to russian borders. and funding ngos who were not really charities, but subversive infiltrators. he is an evil man. have you noticed how many billonaire jews are involved in all kinds of evil financial schemes, and or hold such high positions in both neoliberal as well as neocon both sides of the fencegovernment positions although they only make up 2 of the populace? why hasnt this criminal been arrested? his aim is to deliberately stir up a race war. the police are attacking people of all colors and ages. yet blm seems to defend black men who were in truth, guilty. at least they could pick a black man or woman who was actually innocent. why doesnt black lives matter defend blacks who have been murdered by other blacks, which is usually the case. or dont those black lives matter? and how about the 72 of black children born to single mothers, with no father in the home? often to siblings from multiple fathers. these children often grow up to be street thugs. the facts bear this out. blacks do commit most of the crime in the u.s, and commit more crimes against whites as well. the issue should be on the increasing police brutality on all citizens, not only focused on black lives. the police target them more because blacks commit most of the crime. does the truth enter this equation? blm detracts from the entire populace of all races focusing together, on increased police brutality against the public at large. for soros, and those who want to increase anti-white sentiment and race tensions, blm is mission accomplished. the bastard soros should have been arrested a long time ago, and imprisoned, and not in one of those cushy hotel prisons either. and one can only wonder who is really running this nation, when soros remains unfettered. dan 
maybe, just maybe hitler saw something that the rest of the world still can not see. or simply refuses to see az patriot 
what are you saying, all jews should have been sent to the gas chamber so that soros wouldnt be around ? dan 
oh right, your one of those kinds of people huh.. next you are going to tell me that they really did make lampshades and soap out of jews huh? az patriot 
if i were you, i wouldnt continue to show your ignorance, insensitivity and anti jew sentiment. go away dan 
im ignorant? bwahahah. heres an easy one for ya, whats 6 minus 3 ? carolyn 
idiot must run in your family carolyn 
dan, you are an atheist who wants the world to believe that hitler did not slaughter millions of jews. go to the holocaust museums filled with the pictures and tools the nazis used to experiment on the children pictures taken by the american soldiers when they entered into the prisons. so go into a hellnory site and w her with your crap. dan 
so, explain to me how they had to change the plaque at auschwitz in the 90s from claiming 4 million died there to only just over 1 million? and its now believed that its not even 1 million that died there? 
and you dare to call me the idiot? keep googling, im sure you can find it carolyn 
i did not call you an idiot but i should have. auschwitz was only one of many concentration and death camps. you check it out. dan 
wow, you have shown your level of stupid on 2 levels in the one post, good work.. but i digress, ad hominems like yours only exist to show your own lack of a reasonable argument 
auschwitz was well known to have been by far the largest concentration camp during ww2 with the greatest population compared to all other camps, it even boasted a swimming pool inside the camp for its population. how do they just lose 3 million deaths from that camp? if auschwitz could not accomodate 4 million deaths but only closer to 1 million how did the other much smaller camps process more deaths than alschwitz? 
now, here is hte real kicker, from back in 1901 jews were already claiming the 6 million 4 decades into the future its in the damn newspapers and you can freely search and find them for yourself 
care to explain how that happened? jew magic i guess?  carolyn 
dan did you read any of the small incomplete articles? evidently not. 6m was quoted to show that russia and other countries had that many jews. nothing about death. these prior years to 1938 were expressing the plight of how the jewish people were being treated. now auschwitz was not the only camp that slaughtered jews. now does that sign specifically say that auschwitz deaths were just auschwitz murders? your damn newspapers need to be read by you before you put that smudge attitude in writing. dan 
wow, your brain really is broken huh? you cant see the connection between claiming the magical 6 million prophecy which is actually about claiming the heartland in 1900 and using that same exact figure in the lies about ww2? the same lies that the nazis also made lampshades and soap out of jews? 
auschwitz plaque was obviously blatantly lying just like the lampshades and soap myths, once the soviets were forced to give up the ledgers iirc in the 80s it was obvious that they could no longer sustain the lie that 4 million were killed there and were forced to bring that number down to about 1.5 million. are you really that stupid that you can not see the pattern here? 
there is a hell of a lot more but i get the feeling that im talking to someone to stupid to even grasp the basics. 
fun fact anne frank never wrote anne franks diary, otto bought the story from another novelist and changed it to reflect his daughter. there was even a recent copyright case where they are now claiming that he was the author. fun times. carolyn 
oh i see your pattern. believe that crap instead of what the pictures, written accounts by the liberation armies, and you did not answer my question on the articles you want to point to that does not say 6m jews died. did you pull all of the articles and read the whole story? i would bet you did not. you are a typical atheist, marxist, democrat. you can pound your chest again when you check history and find out that the democraps started the kkk group and were the biggest slave owners. you people amaze me how you put crap out there that you can not back up. kind of like your loving candidate hellnory. dan 
show me a single picture of gassed jews? or even of the gas chambers themselves? or even the several thousand dead jews they would have to have piled up waiting for their several hours in the crematorium it actually took back then to cremate even a single body? or you mean i am meant to take the word of the proven lying jews who to this day, like in the video i linked above, have clung to their fantasies even after they have been busted lying? 
as for the liberating armies, you do recall that all the gas chambers were in ruins when they came through? and there was zero evidence, besides the lamp shades and soap, of any jew holocaust? that account you mean? 
and of course it dosnt say that 6 million died yet, only that they were in peril etc but you dont find it a mighty large coincidence? you also obviously have no idea how they came up with the 6 million at the end of ww2 do you? go find out where that number came from.. the person who made it up even claimed it was completely symbolic and not to be taken literally. 
you are a typical atheist, marxist, democrat. and in the face of clear defeat, out with the mindless ad hominem once again. a clear indicator that you are way outside of your depth you are incorrect on all 3 counts, once again. do you ever get anything right? 
were the biggest slave owners. guess who the biggest slave owners were? fucking jews!!! hahaha. they owned all the slave ships and were behind every facet of the trade. 
kind of like your loving candidate hellnory. and thats the funniest, go find my twitter feed, its full of anti hillary sentiment, in fact its the only reason i really began using twitter was during this election cycle to keep track of whats going on because i refuse to engage in the corrupt leftist media once again, mostly jew owned for fear of turning into a brainless zombie like yourself 
ill give you this tho, you certainly are persistent in your stupidity. its no wonder you cant see anything thats going on around you in this world. dan 
here is a great classic you really should watch about his explaining away his lies as not really lies  carolyn 
you really have a real talent referencing things. dan 
yea, this is how you learn things. you take a fairytale, lets use santa as an example, and you work out when your like 6 years old how can there be 12 santas in the same place? why are my presents always in the bottom of my parents wardrobe a week before santa apparently brings them to you a week later? and slowly you deduce that there is no santa clause and its just a lie that you have been fed while your brain is all still mushy. 
or you know, you can just blindly have faith that there is still a santa, you know, like you do even in the face of such a mountain of evidence carolyn 
you need to stop your atheistic info because you do not know what you are talking about. 1.1m jews killed in all of the auschwitz camps. did you know that there were 3 large camps with 4 large crematoriums? no you did not. that is just a drop in the bucket places that murdered, experimented on, starved, gased, and shooting of jews. 426k hungary, 300k poland, 69k france, 60k netherlands, 55k greece, 46k boheman  moravia, 27k slovakia, 25k belgium, 10k yugoslavia, 8k itally, 690 norway, and 34k from other countries. 960k jews, 74k poles, 21k gypsies, 15k soviet prisoners, 15k czecks, yugoslavs, french, germans. did you know that hitler had built 40,000 camps. death camps, concentration camps, holding camps, gas camp vans, labor camps and detention camps. many jews died in ghettos, on trains, during the death march to evade the oncoming of the russian army and us forces. these camps were set up in france, russia, germany, poland, and austria. one of the camps, berkenau, killed 6 thousand jews per day. in total 2.7m jews killed in killing centers and 3.3 jews shot, gased, experimented on. now how do you explain your decision to not believe these totals? dan 
of course i knew, i obviously know more about the subject than you do. like you i came from a place of believing the lies until i started questioning some of the facts i was taught and the advent of the internet and survivors videos where they constantly get busted telling lies made me reconsider the truth about ww2 
actually current scholars beleive its somewhere between 300k and i think its 700k it might be 800k died in all of auschwitz. while i do not doubt that there was some experimenting america was doing the same thing but on its own people at the time the great majority were simply natural attrition in a time of war considering the allies were bombing supply lines constantly yet never the camps themselves because they also knew they were not death camps in fact lets invoke the story of the holocaust poster child again anne frank, if they were really gassing people in some huge manner why would they even keep around a weak sickly girl long enough for her to die from typhus? 
and yes of course many people died, many of them jews. thats what happens when you have wars. none of this supports gassing or mass extermination of jews, stupid. 
but my final question is, how do you blindly believe the word of people who have been shown on many occasions to be liars? specially in the face of so much verifiable evidence to the contrary ie the lampshades, soap, diesel gassing vans, eye witness stories that completely contradict everything etc specially knowing the fact that many jews chose to escape with their german captors rather than await the soviet armys rescue? carolyn 
of course you did not know any of the information i wrote. if you profess that you know how many died, then go on the holocaust site and you will see that after they checked the records that the germans kept, you do know they tattooed the jews, to make sure what numbers were dead or alive. how would i know why they kept anne franks till she died of typhus. they very cruel people. the jews were at war with the nazi germans. what the hell are you talking about. if you go on the site you will see pictures of the gas chambers and crematories. what the hell else do you want. why dont you go to auschwitz and see for yourself? you are so bigoted and i believe you are a lousy democrap. despicable rem1875 certified 
hitler has the rothschild and other bank roll him while killing off the poor and middle class jews who hardly dominate their own street block let alone the world. as a true socialist he had the pragmatic double standards so many on the left have today. az patriot

"26 wikileaks bombshells on hillary you need to know 26 wikileaks bombshells on hillary you need to know most explosive revelations that could keep clinton out of white house published 26 mins ago about   archive leo hohmann is a news editor for wnd. he has been a reporter and editor at several suburban newspapers in the atlanta and charlotte, north carolina, areas and also served as managing editor of triangle business journal in raleigh, north carolina. print hillary clinton with top aide huma abedin. 
wikileaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what hillary clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration, but clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations. 
she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks, despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement. 
the emails also shed light on how the clinton campaign interacts with wall street banks, with friendly media, and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of democratic rival bernie sanders with the help of the dnc. 
wikileaks says it has about 50,000 emails from the private gmail account of john podesta, a senior democratic party official who has served as white house chief of staff under president bill clinton and a senior adviser to president obama. he was the author of obamas climate change policy. john podesta 
in february podesta moved seamlessly from the white house to become chairman of hillary clintons 2016 presidential campaign. 
here are some of the most explosive revelations from the wikileaks email dumps featuring podestas account and others. 
preference for muslim americans in 2008, when podesta served as co-chair of president-elect barack obamas transition team, michael froman, a former citibank executive, sent podesta a list of african american, latino and asian american candidates, broken down by cabinetdeputy and underassistantdeputy assistant level, plus a list of native american, arabmuslim american and disabled american candidates. the arab american list came with a special note to exclude arab christians  they had to be both arab and muslim.as new republic reports, obamas eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as froman recommended.froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. 
shielding obama in a march 4, 2015, email to hillary clintons lawyer cheryl mills, clintons eventual campaign chairman podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between clinton and president obama that were sent over clintons private server.the day before podesta sent his email to mills, the house benghazi committee privately told clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.the email from podesta to mills says think we should hold emails to and from potus? thats the heart of his exec privilege. we could get them to ask for that. they may not care, but it seems like they will. an email exchange between podesta, paul begala, and clinton pollster gqrr shows the clinton campaign was pushing the muslim obama narrative back in january 2008. included was a survey of obama negative facts such as this one obama owe-bahm-uhs father was a muslim and obama grew up among muslims in the worlds most populous islamic country. the pollster writes we have reworked the obama message into the survey, as requested. 
secret speeches to wall street hillary clinton was so enraged that bill clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at wall street bank morgan stanley in 2015 that she needed a cool down period. the email chain, on march 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both hillary clinton and former president clinton, and reveals that hillarys future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of bill giving a speech to a wall street bank. morgan stanley is coming down, wrote robby mook in an email to top clinton aides.top aide huma abedin explained that hillary would not be happy about it, writing hrc very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. i will have to tell her that bill chose to cancel it, not that we asked. hillary clintons paid speeches to goldman sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this years primary, were the subject of an email to podesta. excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by clintons research team, including the necessity of having both a public and a private position on issues. it was just part of making sausage in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. some flags in hillary clintons paid speeches were noted in a jan. 25 email from campaign research director tony carrk to top clinton advisers, including clintons declaration that my dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere. countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as fact checkers tried to downplay this email by saying it was mostly about trade, not immigration, as if the words open borders were never mentioned. but the email exchange also shows how hillarys about-face on the tpp trade deal was mere pandering to bernie sanders voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. in a speech at goldman-black rock on feb. 4, 2014, carrk pointed out, clinton admitted shes kind of far removed from middle-class struggles due to the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and i now enjoy. clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to wall street, an issue primary opponent bernie sanders continually raised. clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting donald trump for not releasing his tax returns. 
working in tandem with friendly media wnd reported tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for hillary clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. univision chairman haim saban urged the clinton campaign to hit donald trump harder over immigration. the boston globe tried to time a clinton opinion piece to do the most good in new hampshire. cnbcs john harwood urged clinton campaign chairman podesta to watch out for then-gop candidate dr. ben carson. democratic national committee official and cnn contributor donna brazile apparently tipped off the clinton campaign to a potentially difficult cnn town-hall question on capital punishment during the democratic party primary season. brazile adamantly denies it . in a july 2015 email, new york times reporter mark leibovich appeared to ask permission from hillary clintons communications director, jennifer palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference clinton made to sarah palin and delete clintons statement, and gay rights has moved much faster than womens rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon. cnbc correspondent john harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to donald trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the clinton campaign, emailing podesta with the subject line watch out. the warning was regarding gop presidential candidate ben carson, who could give you real trouble in a general election. maggie haberman, a former politico reporter who now works for the new york times, was described in a january 2015 memo as having a very good relationship with the clinton campaign. we have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed, the memo said. 
demeaning catholics podesta discussed fomenting revolution in the catholic church with a progressive activist while hillarys now-communications director jennifer palmieri mocked catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the democratic party. there needs to be a catholic spring, in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church, sandy newman, president and founder of the nonprofit voices for progress, wrote podesta in february 2012 . the email, among the third batch released by wikileaks, was titled opening for a catholic spring? just musing. podesta tells newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this, the clinton campaign chairman writes. but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now. likewise catholics united. like most spring movements, i think this one will have to be bottom up. clinton, who has accused trump of praising putin, called the russian leader in a 2014 speech engaging and a very interesting conversationalist. excerpts from clintons speeches were contained in a document emailed to podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. 
collusion with doj clinton spokesman brian fallon alerted staffers that the justice department was proposing to publish clintons work-related emails, contending it showed collusion between the obama administration and clintons campaign. fallon wrote that doj folks told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october, podesta met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including peter kadzik, a top official at the justice department. lawyers also told the clinton campaign in emails that hillarys private email scandal  smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing ive either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc . 
entanglements with foreign governments king muhammad iv of morocco made a 12 million pledge to fund the clinton global initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. hillarys top aide, huma abedin, wrote in a january 2015 email that if hrc was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. then she warned she created this mess and she knows it. hillary ended up not attending but her husband bill did. an email from hillary clintons account to podesta on aug. 17, 2014, said saudi arabia and qatar were providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isis and other radical sunni groups in the region. critics have pointed out that the clinton foundation has received considerable funding from the two middle east nations. in a leaked 2013 paid speech to the jewish united fund of metropolitan chicago, hillary said jordan and turkey cant possibly vet all those refugees so they dont know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees. two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of syrian refugees coming to the u.s. largely from united nations refugee camps in jordan. 
insiders insider had sway over dnc a wikileaks email dump on july 22 revealed that debbie wasserman schultz used her position as head of the dnc to work in concert with the clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of sen. bernie sanders, d-vt. schultz was forced to resign over the emails. issues used to undermine sanders campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. the clinton campaign tried to reschedule the illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate republican would get a boost following the super tuesday primaries. the clintons wont forget what their friends have done for them, wrote robby mook, who later became clintons campaign manager, in the november 2014 email to podesta.",238,736264,real
"mainstream reports foggy - moa outed as russian propaganda site november 25, 2016 mainstream reports foggy - moa outed as russian propaganda site 
al masdar news syria, nov 25 2016 - syrian air force denies bombing turkish army in east aleppo 
avid readers of news sides will ask which of those reports is correct. they may turn to the so-called hint it's not ""paper of record"", the new york times and find this nov 24 report syrian warplanes kill turkish soldiers fighting in syria 
while that nyt headline claims certainty the text does not. it obediently repeats the turkish government claim but adds syrian arab rebel forces fighting with the turks said they had not received official notification that the syrian government had launched the strike. one fighter said he had heard that the strike was from the syrian government but heard later that it had been from the islamic state. the syrian observatory for human rights, a network based in britain that monitors news from syria, also said that the strike had been by the islamic state. 
an updated version of that report adds some on the ground raised questions about whether the strike was undertaken by syrian government forces. a network of activists who monitor the skies over syria said thursday that its watchers had spotted a syrian aircraft taking off after 2 a.m. and also a russian aircraft about the same time as the strike on turkish forces occurred. it is impossible to know where the planes that were sighted went; they could easily have had another destination, the network said. 
the syrian observatory for human rights, a network based in britain that monitors news from syria, said the strike was by the islamic state. but the islamic state, also known as isis, is not known to have combat aircraft. 
--- excursus the syrian observatory for human rights sohr is a sophisticated disinformation outlet of the british foreign intelligence service mi-6. sohr is on one side very manipulating, i.e. sohr counts only foreigners, deserters of the syrian army, isis and al-qaeda fighters on the anti-government side as ""rebels killed"". ten-thousands of syrian civilians who took up arms to become well paid ""syrian rebel"" fighters are counted as ""civilians"" when besieged, killed or wounded. on the other side sohr provides the most complete and detailed record of the war. it helps its reputation and is the reason why it is a favorite quoted source for ""western"" news ""reporting"". --- 
the answer to the reader's question is that both hurriyet and al masdar, are right and the nyt writers are confused by the fog of war and too lazy to do basic research. the devil is, as always, in the details. 
on november 23 a turkish armored military vehicle was attacked near the village wiqah north of al-bab in northern syria. some sources claimed a guided missile strike. isis related twitter accounts claimed a suicide attack. note the above account has now been suspended. 
isis later released a picture of the claimed suicide bomber. 
the sohr account of the turkish vehicle hit, cited by the nyt, obviously refers to this november 23 attack. 
the air-attack on the turkish soldiers north of al-bab happened on november 24 at 330am local time according to the turkish army. it was confirmed to journalists by very senior people in damascus. the al masdar news account though, seemingly denying such a strike, includes a very specific non-denial-denial quote a high-ranking official from the syrian arab air force saayf told al-masdar on thursday night that their fighter jets did not bomb the turkish army in east aleppo. 
""no syrian or russian aircraft bombed the turkish army near al-bab on november 23rd - all reports claiming otherwise are lies,"" the official confirmed to al-masdar on thursday. 
the airstrike did not on occur on the 23rd, as ""denied"" by saayf, but on the 24th. the nyt report mixes up two attacks as one, while basic research shows evidence of two very different attacks. the al masdar folks do not understand the specificity of the quotes their sources give. 
mystery solved. 
hurriyet and others have connected the syrian air-attack to the turkish attack on a russian jet exactly one year before. i doubt that this coincident is intended. al-bab, held by isis and coveted by nearby turkish, kurdish and syrian government forces, is an important target that will be fought over between the various sides for some time to come. the hit was not some symbolic, historic revenge act, nor was it to roast turkey for thanksgiving, but a signal to turkey that al-bab is and will stay off limits for its forces. 
news accounts of war, be those of casualties, of specific incidents or assume motivations, are always suspect . they are often written with disinformation in mind. historic accounts are mostly written by the winners of a specific conflict and heavily ""colored"" from that perspective. forensic or video proof can be easily forged and should always be taken with many pinches of salt. only diligent research on all sides of a conflict can uncover what really happened. only when ""reports"" from opposite sides agree on numbers or specific incidents on can assume to be near the truth. 
but when one tries to be diligent and not solely on one side, one can be sure to end up as denounced and hated by at least one if not all sides of a conflict. this website, moonofalabama.org , is now listed as ""russian propaganda outlet"" by some neoconned, nato aligned, anonymous "" friendly neighborhood propaganda identification service "" prominently promoted by the washington post . the minions running that censorship list also watch over our ""russian propaganda"" twitter account moonofa .

republican theodore roosevelt was the first president to invite an african-american, booker t. washington, to dine in the white house on oct. 16, 1901. a southern democrat newspapers condemned him it, as printed in the memphis scimitar the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the united states was committed yesterday by the president, when he invited a n- to dine with him at the white house. it would not be worth more than a passing notice if theodore roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a pullman car porter, but roosevelt the individual and roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light. 
in 1909, theodore roosevelt warned the thought of modern industry in the hands of christian charity is a dream worth dreaming. the thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining. the choice between the two is upon us. 
in 1917, the new york bible society had theodore roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket new testament  book of psalms given to world war i soldiers the teachings of the new testament are foreshadowed in micahs verse micah vi. 8 what more does the lord require of thee than to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy god? do justice; and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of germany and turkey, for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of moloch and beelzebub on this earth. love mercy; treat prisoners well, succor the wounded, treat every woman as if she was your sister, care for the little children, and be tender to the old and helpless. walk humbly; you will do so if you study the life and teachings of the saviour. may the god of justice and mercy have you in his keeping.  signed theodore roosevelt.

theodore roosevelt, in his book fear god and take your own part ny george h. doran co., 1916, wrote 
armenians  for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war  are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors, the turks, have not been pacifists but militarists. t. roosevelt, fear god, p. 61, 64 
armenians, have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the napoleonic warsthe wars of genghis khan and tamerlane in asia. yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged.  this course of national infamy  began when the last administration surrendered to the peace at-any-price people, and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties. individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milk-and-water invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of blood-and-iron. t. roosevelt, fear god, p. 111 
american eye-witness of the fearful atrocities, mr. arthur h. gleason new york tribune, nov. 25, 1915 serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish. now, the armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an old-time apache indian.  
even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heaped-up horrors of the past year and a half, the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation. let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation, and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds.  if this people through its government had not shirked its duty  we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of armenia. 
mass meetings on behalf of the armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them.  the principles of the peace-at-any-price men, of the professional pacifists  will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness.  this crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the armenians  must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the united states for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed.  the devastation of poland and serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenth-century europe.  
weak and timid milk-and-water policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the blood-and-iron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world. the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians. they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them, atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan. 
it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in thought, between right and the most hideous wrong, neutral between despairing and hunted people, people whose little children are murdered and their women raped, and the victorious and evil wrong-doers.  
i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities. i trust that they feel  that a peace obtained without  righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war.  
wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just, who put honor above safety, who are true to a lofty ideal of duty, who prepare in advance to make their strength effective, and who shrink from no hazard, not even the final hazard of war, if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness. when our people take this stand, we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesseson an even greater scale in armenia. t. roosevelt, fear god, pp. 377-383 
in his book fear god and take your part, 1916, theodore roosevelt wrote 
christianity is not the creed of asia and africa at this moment solely because the seventh century christians of asia and africa had trained themselves not to fight, whereas the moslems were trained to fight. christianity was saved in europe solely because the peoples of europe fought. 
if the peoples of europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and on up to and including the 17th century, had not possessed a military equality with, and gradually a growing superiority over the mohammedans who invaded europe, europe would at this moment be mohammedan and the christian religion would be exterminated. 
a contemporary of theodore roosevelt was the english author g.k. chesterton, who wrote of western christian civilization the collected works of g.k. chesterton volume xx, introduction and notes by james v. schall, ignatius press they seem entirely to forget that long before the crusaders had dreamed of riding to jerusalem, the moslems had almost ridden into paris. 
theodore roosevelt continued in fear god and take your part, 1916 wherever the mohammedans have had complete sway, wherever the christians have been unable to resist them by the sword, christianity has ultimately disappeared. from the hammer of charles martel to the sword of jan sobieski, christianity owed its safety in europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the mohammedan aggressor.

"it looks like george soros is funding the trump protests just like he funded the ferguson riots paid instigators are making an already bad situation much much worse. as riots and protests rage through the streets of america, the question has to be asked. 
via activistpost 

does someone behind the scenes want to see civil war in the united states? the answer is almost certainly yes.
and it isnt likely to settle down anytime in the next few days. if you arent prepped for this, go here to learn how to stay safe. just a little background this has been going on since the midst of the campaign when actors were hired on craigslist and trained to disrupt rallies. for example, one craigslist ad was answered by paul horner, who admitted he was paid 3,500 to cause a scene at a trump event in fountain hills, arizona.
as for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be hillary clintons campaign, horner said. the actual check i received after i was done with the job was from a group called women are the future. after i was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who i was with or communicated with me in any way, i should start talking about how great bernie sanders is. horner continued, it was mostly women in their 60s at the interview that i went to source

the same report goes on to say
when asked about the other protesters at the rally, horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.
almost all of the people i was protesting with i had seen at my interview and training class. at the rally, talking with some of them, i learned they only paid latinos 500, muslims 600 and african americans 750. i dont think they were looking for any asians. women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received 300 across the board. i think i was paid more than the other protesters because i was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back
you can also read this article, in which a quote caught on video from project veritas shows how the clinton campaign caused disruptions via bird-dogging.
theres a lot of evidence that someone is funding these protests. an eyewitness in austin, texas spotted protesters being transported by chartered coach buses.

 erictucker erictucker november 10, 2016
then there was this craigslist ad.

there are many more tweets along these lines, but suffice it to say, suspicion is high that these, just like the clinton campaign, are rigged to manipulate the american people.
why would anyone want to cause all this trouble? thats where the web gets tangled. it certainly seems counterproductive to set fire to america. after all, what these people are doing is likely to end up with more tyranny  like martial law, for example.
exactly. thats precisely the plan.
back in august, hackers from a group called dc leaks got into the private documents of the open society, an organization founded by george soros. soros, whom dc leaks referred to as the architect and sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years is a pro-globalist billionaire who has been trying to take over the world via shadow government for decades.
zero hedge reported on the findings in the soros leak
the documents are from multiple departments of soros organizations. soros the open society foundations seems to be the group with the most documents in the leak. files come from sections representing almost all geographical regions in the world, from the usa, to europe, eurasia, asia, latin, america, africa, the world bank the presidents office, as well as an unknown entity named souk. as the daily caller notes, there are documents dating from at least 2008 to 2016.
documents in the leak range from research papers such as european crisis key developments of the past 48 hours focusing on the impact of the refugee crisis, to a document titled the ukraine debate in germany, to an update specific financials of grants.
they reveal work plans, strategies, priorities and other activities by soros, and include reports on european elections, migration and asylum in europe.
an email leaked by wikileaks earlier this week showed soros had advised hillary clinton during her tenure as secretary of state on how to handle unrest in albania  advice she acted on. as well, its important to note that soros provided a whopping 33 million to activists in ferguson, missouri, escalating a protest to a siege. the washington times reported
liberal billionaire george soros, who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts american politics and policy, not unlike what he did with moveon.org. mr. soros spurred the ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the u.s., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by the washington times.
in all, mr. soros gave at least 33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in ferguson, according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit open society foundations this is business as usual for the osf open society foundation, as explained by director kenneth zimmerman
mr. zimmerman said osf has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early 90s, and that, although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of mr. soros grants, they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of open society.
the incidents, whether in staten island, cleveland or ferguson, were spontaneous protests  we dont have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say, mr. zimmerman said. but these circumstances focused peoples attention  and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation.
soros-sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in ferguson, building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign. other soros-funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep, and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive.
the plethora of organizations involved not only shared mr. soros funding, but they also fed off each other, using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on anothers website, referencing each others news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of facebook likes and twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds.
soros was busted for paying protesters to go into ferguson and stir things up. this is not theory. its fact. the daily mail reported that soros spent 33 million to bankroll the protests. the washington times reported that it was totally cool, though, because humanitarian that he is, soros just wanted to help the civil rights movement. what a guy. of course, this seems to be a thing with the kabillionaires. the ford foundation and rockefeller foundation also fund social activism. which is kabillionaire code for mess stuff up and wreak havoc.
and guess who footed the bill for the rent-a-thug protesters at trump rallies in california and new york? heres another source, too. you guessed it. everyones favorite hungarian-american troll. keep in mind that the organization black lives matter was born through the ferguson riots.
does this look familiar? if the modus operandi in these protests looks familiar, thats because moveon.org is organizing a lot of them, and moveon is funded byyou guessed it george soros. the organization was originally founded to combat the impeachment of bill clintonare you seeing a link here? another proud instigator is the answer coalition which also  are you sitting down? has links to soros.
there are a lot of people who are out there because they genuinely oppose a trump presidency. the unfortunate thing is, their opposition comes from propaganda that they passionately believe. they are acting based on misinformation and theyre being professionally manipulated. the next step here is martial law, which nobody wants.
well, nobody except george soros and friends. someone who wants to see america ripped apart is causing this division. last summer, it was leaked that soros attempted to destabilize russia and depose putin in 2012. putin responded by banning soros and all of his organizations from russia. in 2014, putin issued an international arrest warrant for soros. we could certainly improve both international relationships and our current situation by extraditing soros immediately.",199,736279,fake
"clinton campaign urges fbi to detail new developments in email case by reuters   634 pm democrat hillary clinton's top aides on saturday lashed out at fbi director james comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading ""innuendo.""   
by roberta rampton and steve holland 
daytona beach, fla.golden, colo. reuters  democrat hillary clintons top aides on saturday lashed out at fbi director james comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading innuendo. 
comey, who has headed the federal bureau of investigation since 2013, notified the u.s. congress on friday that the agency is again reviewing emails, even though in july it decided not to seek prosecution of clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state. 
john podesta, who heads clintons presidential campaign, told reporters that comeys letter to congress was light on facts, heavy on innuendo, and he urged comey to come forward and give those answers to the american public about the exact nature of the fbis latest review of emails. 
sources close to the investigation on friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into anthony weiner, the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin. 
weiner, a former u.s. congressman from new york, is the target of an fbi investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in north carolina. 
with the nov. 8 elections quickly approaching, republican presidential candidate donald trump pounded away at the new fbi development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in golden, colorado, to attacking clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency. 
her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful, trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure. 
comey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the fbi or the nature of their contents. 
clintons campaign tried to play down the new review. theres no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing, podesta said, in the fbis latest announcement that it was taking appropriate investigative steps after learning of emails that appear to be pertinent to the earlier probe. 
clinton campaign manager robby mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said americans had already factored what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots. 
we dont see it changing the landscape for undecided voters, mook said. 
clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters. 
clinton was campaigning in florida on saturday, a battleground state that many analysts say trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected. 
in recent weeks, trump has been running behind clinton in most public opinion polls. 
justice department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the fbi directors letter being sent to congress and believe his actions conflict with a justice department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections. 
while attorney general loretta lynch did not discuss the matter directly with comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other. 
comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow-up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the fbis probe of clintons emails, the source said. 
meanwhile, clinton supporters rallied to her defense following fridays fbi disclosure. 
the congressional black caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the house of representatives, nearly all democrats, held a news conference in columbus, ohio, and urged comey to release more details.

"7 reasons i'll vote for trump print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov. 8. 
first, im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting, not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you. 
second, im not endorsing donald trump. in my mind, theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. 
third, i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro, bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore. 
fourth, i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were st. donald. i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings, constantly saying, let him who is without sin cast the first one see john 87. this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. 
fifth, my decision to vote for trump, barring something earth-shattering between now and nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been 1 during the gop primaries, i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices. i did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if trump won the nomination, i would re-evaluate my position. 2 once trump became the republican candidate, i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3 i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary. for two strong warnings about hillary, see here and here . 
so, what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump? 
the culture war is not over! gain hope, courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book, outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first, i believe that he actually is serious about appointing pro-life, pro-constitution supreme court justices. when he said during the last debate that if youre pro-life, you want to see roe v. wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flip-flop if elected. 
second, one reason i endorsed sen. ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both democratic and republican, to the point of calling it the washington cartel. trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although, unfortunately, hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system, so my vote for him is also a protest vote. 
third, i am voting for the republican platform, not the republican party, which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. 
fourth, while i have always felt that the line, were electing a president, not a pastor, was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, were electing a general to train hand-to-hand combat warriors, not a pastor, it might have more relevance. in other words, we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges, and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one. rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. and with things so messed up in america, the hand-to-hand combat analogy is closer to home. 
fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see, she a pro-abortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against late-term abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. since i have the opportunity to vote, i feel that i should vote for trump. 
sixth, trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump. yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a born-again christian i see absolutely no evidence of this, the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. 
seventh, although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house. in that context, i echo the words and warning of dr. martin luther king jr. the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. it must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority. 
so, in sum 1 my hope is in god, not donald trump, and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america; 2 my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation; 3 i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm; and 4 ultimately, the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump, while also praying that god will use him for good , not for evil. 
in the end, if trump gets elected and fails miserably, i will be grieved but not devastated. if he does well, i will rejoice. 
either way, though, my vote is just that a vote. my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution. receive michael brown's commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael brown's alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email. name",238,736263,real

как сообщает риа новости, ссылаясь на представителя городского умвд, было установлено, что в полицию звонили братья  один учится в первом классе, второй в пятом. ранее дети на учете не стояли, они из благополучной семьи. 
сотрудникам полиции ученики пояснили, что просто хотели пошутить и о последствиях не догадывались. 
мальчикам еще нет 14 лет, поэтому ответственность за поступок будут нести родители. мать уже вызвана в полицию, на нее составлен административный протокол о ненадлежащем воспитании несовершеннолетних. родителям грозит штраф, все документы передадут на рассмотрение в суд. 
отметим, звонки от неизвестных о, якобы, заложенных бомбах в учебных заведениях, нередки. проблема безопасности в российских школах поднималась много раз, но положение дел, по большей части, оказывается неизменным. брешь в безопасности не позволяет утверждать стопроцентно, что в школе нет бомбы. 
несколько лет назад, прямо перед днем знаний, корреспонденты ""правды.ру"" испытали "" школьную безопасность "". тогда мы пронесли в учебное заведение пустую коробку с надписью ""бомба"" и оставили ее неподалеку от классов. нам не препятствовала ни охрана, ни педагоги. причем, также легко и непринужденно мы забрали коробку обратно. 
частными охранными организациями осуществляется контроль 20 тысяч школ по всей стране. и безопасность детей напрямую зависит от чопа, который коллегиально выбрали родители и педагоги. если где-то охранники являются настоящими профессионалами и не допустят никаких внештатных ситуаций, то в некоторых фирмах на пост в школе сажают человека, у которого от охранника  лишь надпись на груди. естественно, что в первом случае услуги обходятся дороже, чем во втором, и выбор зачастую очевиден. 
если разобраться, то компетентность школьного охранника прямо пропорциональна его стоимости. за небольшие деньги нельзя требовать от сотрудника уникальных способностей. ведь по большому счету, один человек должен быть экспертом по комплексной безопасности зданий и сооружений, вахтером, личным телохранителем, обладать некоторыми навыками в психологии общения с детьми, быть не агрессивным и образованным. что и говорить, список внушительный, чего не скажешь о зарплате. на деле школьный охранник, зачастую, вялый молодой человек, которому мало до чего есть дело, а желание отсидеть смену и сбежать ""из этого ада"" является приоритетным. 
единственное место, которое контролируется такими секьюрити  входная дверь. во время летних ремонтов в школу можно завезти хоть целый арсенал, а во время учебного года в некоторых школах под носом у охранника торгуют различными наркотическими веществами. 
загвоздка в том, что, опять же, в тендере на охрану школ выигрывают те, кто просит за свои услуги самую низкую цену. и как бы не убеждали чопы, где охрана действительно чего-то стоит, что их цена оправдана, выбор останавливают на самых недорогих.

"flash mob of black teens assault whites, media silent on if it's a hate crime.  daily wire aaron bandler october 27, 2016 
a flash mob of over 150 blacks teens assaulted numerous people on friday in philadelphia in an attack that appears to have been racially motivated, and yet the media is silent about this possible motivation. 
lifezette reports that the racial component of the attack was evident in a facebook post written by joe lauletta , whose daughter, christina, was attacked by the flash mob on friday. lauletta wrote that he received a phone call from christina, who tearfully explained that she ""was jumped"" and ""beat up pretty bad."" 
""i find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30-40 black teenagers on their way home from the temple football game,"" lauletta wrote. ""this happened after they got off the subway at broad and cecil b moore. these sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened."" 
while no bones were broken, christina was ""badly bruised"" throughout her body, lauletta said ""it makes me cry just thinking about it."" 
lauletta's post seemed to indicate the racial aspect of the attack, and on tuesday he posted on facebook that ""the fbi is investigating"" and ""are analyzing all video coverage,"" signaling that the fbi is looking into the attack as a hate crime. 
in an interview with the new york post , lauletta wouldn't explicitly say the attack was racially motivated but sort of implied it 
well, i havent been saying that because everybody is trying to get me to say it and i dont know if i want to be that person, lauletta told the post. everyone can draw their own conclusions. 
lauletta said the possibility of the attacks being motivated by race  perhaps as a sort of gang initiation  was part of the reason why his story was shared so frequently and as far away as africa. 
thats why it spread so fast, lauletta said. if you read my facebook page, everybodys saying it. 
however, philadelphia police lt. john stanford insisted to the post that ""there hasnt been any indication that race is involved in this in any shape or form."" 
even still, the media hasn't reported that the attack is possibly a hate crime, as lifezette points out 
friday violence as teen mob attacks temple students, police; four arrested, read the headline on philly.com, while the philly voice reported teens arrested after flash mob leads to assaults on broad street. the associated press headline read students beaten, horse punched in mob attacks at university. 
the washington post buried the possibility in their story and then dismissed it with stanford's quote. 
lifezette also noted that temple university described the attack as ""a large group of approximately 200 juveniles causing disruption along broad street."" 
maybe stanford is correct that it was a random attack, or maybe the black flash mob was targeting whites. but there is no doubting the media's hypocrisy if this were a flash mob of white teenagers that attacked blacks, the media would be screaming about it being a hate crime. but since the incident in philadelphia does not advance the media's racial narrative, they will not treat it in the same manner. tags",43,736264,real
" obama lies all of the time. he doesn't bother to even check the facts to make sure that the is telling the truth. this is just another instance of this. we need to ask other questions. was he sending unsecured emails to hrc? he would need a different smime certificate to send an encrypted email to hrc than the one for addresses because hrc wouldn't have the private key for the state department certificate. so, we have to presume that he knew that he was sending unsecured emial to hrc. the location of the server is a red herring. it was somewhere in cyberspace. what matters is that it was that she was using a private email account that appeared to be unsecured. the fact that it was unsecured is the major point here. if it had been properly secured with digital cryptography, it wouldn't have really mattered if it was in her home at least as far as national securty was concerned.",233,736263,real
"trump threatens press in closed-door meeting; here are the terrifying things he said  new century times in something that couldve been scripted by george orwell, president-elect donald trump just has pretty much every major media personality andor outlet over to trump tower for a closed-door meeting. 
the ny post stated  
the hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. among the attendees were nbcs deborah turness, lester holt and chuck todd, abcs james goldston, george stephanopoulos, david muir and martha raddatz, 
also, cbs norah odonnell john dickerson, charlie rose, christopher isham and king, fox news bill shine, jack abernethy, jay wallace, suzanne scott, msnbcs phil griffin and cnns jeff zucker and erin burnett. 
before the meeting, everyone was speculating as to what was going on. why is trump colluding with the media? is he trying to control the conversation and form some sort of state sponsored media? 
well, speculate no further. trump called everyone to his tower to scold them like the henry the 8th he is very much turning out to be. 
according to one source who confided in the ny post  
it was like a fing firing squadtrump started with cnn chief jeff zucker and said i hate your network, everyone at cnn is a liar and you should be ashamed. 
adding 
the meeting was a total disaster. the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration, but instead they got a trump-style dressing down. 
it was basically trump throwing a hissy fit and talking down to everyone in the media to tell them how very awful they are to him. even though they were pretty soft on him throughout the course of his campaign, often given him an open forum and hours of free airtime to tout his craziness. 
another source said 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. 
further 
trump kept saying, were in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar, and cnn was a network of liarstrump didnt say nbc reporter katy tur by name, but talked about an nbc female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when hillary lost who hosted a debate  which was martha raddatz who was also in the room. 
some of the media did try to get a word in edgewise, but it was pretty much all for naught. trump was there to scold and not get a lesson from the media in freedom of the press and speech. 
ny post reported a source saying 
cbs good morning co-host gayle king did not stand up, but asked some question, how do you propose we the media work with you? chuck todd asked some pretty pointed questions. david muir asked how are you going to cope living in dc while your family is in nyc? it was a horrible meeting. 
according to kellyanne conway, however, it all went really well. yet, its hard to believe a word that comes out of the trump camp, because they will say only what they want people to hear, and most of the time theres barely a sliver of the truth involved. 
no word as to who the source is that spoke to the ny post . 
its pretty clear trump wants to control the narrative of the press, why else would he have so many big news names over to his palace tower? he wanted to scold them and likely tell them how they should be operating, and we should all be very, very mortified that he even had them over in the first place. 
after all, if you control the press, you control what the people hear. if you control what the people hear, you can tell them anything you want, even if its not in their best interests. its horrifying, to say the least, absolutely hitler-esque, if were going to be honest. 
the press need to be counted on to hold trump accountable for everything that he says or does, and if they dont someone needs to hold the press accountable as well. this is a scary time were entering into and hopefully the constitution will not be shredded and honesty with accountability will prevail.

robert de niro gave anti-donald trump protesters across the united states his backing friday as he spoke about how depressed the tycoons win in the presidential election had made him. 
the 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film the comedian in los angeles when he was asked how he was coping with trumps victory over democratic rival hillary clinton. 
how am i doing? im very depressed, the famously laconic raging bull actor told reporters. 
we have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government. 
asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of tuesdays election, he replied yes, absolutely. things arent being done right. 
demonstrators took to the streets in miami, los angeles, new york and other us cities for a third straight night on friday. 
in manhattan, they held signs reading your wall cant stand in our way  a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the us border with mexico. 
de niro hasnt minced his words in his criticism of trump, describing him as a punk, a pig and an idiot. 
id like to punch him in the face, he said before the election. 
earlier in the day a town in southern italy where de niros grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape.

"7 reasons i'll vote for trump print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov. 8. 
first, im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting, not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you. 
second, im not endorsing donald trump. in my mind, theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. 
third, i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro, bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore. 
fourth, i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were st. donald. i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings, constantly saying, let him who is without sin cast the first one see john 87. this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. 
fifth, my decision to vote for trump, barring something earth-shattering between now and nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been 1 during the gop primaries, i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices. i did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if trump won the nomination, i would re-evaluate my position. 2 once trump became the republican candidate, i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3 i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary. for two strong warnings about hillary, see here and here . 
so, what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump? 
the culture war is not over! gain hope, courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book, outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first, i believe that he actually is serious about appointing pro-life, pro-constitution supreme court justices. when he said during the last debate that if youre pro-life, you want to see roe v. wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flip-flop if elected. 
second, one reason i endorsed sen. ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both democratic and republican, to the point of calling it the washington cartel. trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although, unfortunately, hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system, so my vote for him is also a protest vote. 
third, i am voting for the republican platform, not the republican party, which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. 
fourth, while i have always felt that the line, were electing a president, not a pastor, was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, were electing a general to train hand-to-hand combat warriors, not a pastor, it might have more relevance. in other words, we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges, and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one. rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. and with things so messed up in america, the hand-to-hand combat analogy is closer to home. 
fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see, she a pro-abortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against late-term abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. since i have the opportunity to vote, i feel that i should vote for trump. 
sixth, trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump. yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a born-again christian i see absolutely no evidence of this, the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. 
seventh, although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house. in that context, i echo the words and warning of dr. martin luther king jr. the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. it must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority. 
so, in sum 1 my hope is in god, not donald trump, and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america; 2 my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation; 3 i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm; and 4 ultimately, the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump, while also praying that god will use him for good , not for evil. 
in the end, if trump gets elected and fails miserably, i will be grieved but not devastated. if he does well, i will rejoice. 
either way, though, my vote is just that a vote. my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution. receive michael brown's commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael brown's alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email. name",238,736264,real
"captagon and western-backed rebels new drug, old story captagon and western-backed rebels new drug, old story captagon? whats that you may ask? tweet captagon is the addictive drug used by some of the numerous terrorists, jihadis, mercenaries and western-backed rebels in syria  including al-nusra and isis . captagon aka fenethylline, biocapton or fitton was first produced in 1961 as a mix of amphetamine and theophylline. it became illegal in most countries in 1986 due to who pressure. being a stimulant, it fuels feelings of euphoria, fearlessness and power, gives you an energy rush before the crash, and numbs emotions and empathy. these are of course all qualities which are ideal for soldiers who want to kill and not feel the pain. apparently, captagon is playing a significant role in the syrian war , both economically and in terms of its mood-altering ability. multiple drug busts have occurred since 2010. last year in november 2015, turkish authorities confiscated 11 million captagon pills 1800 kg and worth an estimated us220 million that were destined for syria. last month in october, lebanese police seized 3.5 million captagon pills that were headed for saudi arabia. is the drug another avenue by which the western alliance nato-us-uk is trying to influence and control the outcome of the syrian war? drugs and soldiers a connection old as humanity itself 
there is long history of tyrants, monarchs, despots, army generals and military leaders feeding drugs to their soldiers to enhance their performance. a very early example is alexander the great, whose army relied on the opium poppy plant for its morphine and from which modern heroin is made. the morphine allowed his soldiers to walk and fight with grave injuries and achieve astonishing feats of endurance. in more recent history, in both world wars, american and german soldiers used amphetamines during battle. historian norman ohler recently released a book der totale rausch which literally translates as total rush which exposes the nazi use of drugs during wwii. this article quotes norman  the german soldiers used pervitin, a german product patented in 1937 that contains methamphetamine, which is known today as crystal meth. it was freely available as a medicine until 1939. in berlin, it became a drug of choice, like people drink coffee to boost their energy. people took loads of pervitin, across the board. the company wanted pervitin to rival coca cola. so people took it, it worked and they were euphoric  
the nazi rise to power was fueled by their military industrial complex funded by americans and wall st., including ig farben, their powerful pharmaceutical conglomerate which was the ancestor of big pharma today. hitler himself was said to be addicted to opiates the first thing i wanted to see were the personal notes of hitlers personal physician dr theodor morell   these notes were quite elaborate, describing how he treated hitler over the years, including things like injection as always and eukodal, which is a strong opiate. captagon the force behind crazed isis fighters? 
can captagon explain, at least to some degree, the crazed attitude of isis fighters? we dont have definitive proof, but we do have a collation of many anecdotes and quotes indicating that the amphetamine-based drug is a factor. the washington post collected these ones you cant sleep or even close your eyes, forget about it, said a lebanese user featured in this bbc documentary  and whatever you take to stop it, nothing can stop it. i felt like i own the world high. like i have power nobody has. a really nice feeling. there was no fear anymore after i took captagon. so the brigade leader came and told us, this pill gives you energy, try it,  he said. so we took it the first time. we felt physically fit. and if there were 10 people in front of you, you could catch them and kill them. youre awake all the time. you dont have any problems, you dont even think about sleeping, you dont think to leave the checkpoint. it gives you great courage and power. if the leader told you to go break into a military barracks, i will break in with a brave heart and without any feeling of fear at all  youre not even tired. 
the world was first horrified by the cruelty of mercenaries like isis who were defiling historic sites and beheading prisoners. was some of that barbarism due to drug-induced states? where is the captagon being made? 
the cuban based website prensa latina released a short article in 2015 claiming that according to experts, the north atlantic treaty organization nato began production of captagon in 2011 in a laboratory in bulgaria and it is now manufactured elsewhere in the world. part of the profits from the illegal trade in captagon, experts say, is used to finance armed extremist groups that are trying to overthrow the syrian government led by president bashar al-assad. 
the article, however, does not mention which experts it got its information from. while this fits in with what we know of nato  a us-controlled, aggressive military organization which invades sovereign nations like libya on the flimsiest of pretexts to gain territory and control for the new world order  there still needs to be more research done to determine the source of captagon. other sources suggest it is being produced in sunni rebel areas. captivated by captagon 
the word captagon, coincidentally, is a mix of the words captivate and pentagon  interesting given the addictive nature of the drug and the potential us role in providing it. war and drugs have a long history together, whether it be because the soldiers are been fed drugs by their commanders, or because the war itself is being fought over the land and fields that grow the drug-producing plants vietnamese and afghani heroin, latin american cocaine. in his article cia drug wars could explain why syrian rebels, isis violence fuelled by captagon pills , journalist patrick henningsen writes that the deliberate strategic dispensing of potent narcotics in a paramilitary, insurgency theater  is a common technique employed by us intelligence agencies  more often than not, these drugs are the x-factor which fuels the extreme violence we see, and its used to terrorize local populations and produces more extreme graphic imagery for western media consumption. the result it aids in the generation of western fear, and public calls for washington  co to step-up its military activity in the region  in order to keep us safe in cozy america. a vicious cycle. isnt this what weve seen in syria so far?",93,736277,fake
"air force cracks down on religious freedom, christian fights back! - freedom outpost print

but there is hope, as some still know what their duty entails. 
christian news reports  
an activist that often works to separate god from the military is seeking the punishment of an air force commander who responded to a recent interview question that jesus is his guide and influences his decisions. 
on sept. 15, the focus was on u.s. air force lt. col. michael kersten, who serves with the 39th medical support squadron. the unit provides preventative and clinical health and wellness services for u.s. and coalition forces. 
is there a leader from your career that influenced you the most? he was asked during the interview. if so, who, and how did they affect the way you lead? 
theres no one in particular, kersten responded. as a christian, my example is to be like christ. he is my guide and affects all of my decisions. he teaches to do all things as unto the lord and i believe this is synonymous with integrity first and excellence in all we do. 
of course, atheist troll mikey weinstein was very displeased to see such statements on a government website. therefore, weinstein wrote to the base commander to have punishment inflicted for such actions. 
christian news continued 
he has essentially stated that christianity or his particular interpretationdenomination of same is the guiding policy of his command, weinstein said. he has very publicly endorsed his singular view of christian faith supremacy and it is not unreasonable or irrational to think that this widespread endorsement in an official air force internet publication could andor would lead to preferential treatment of those subordinates who share his views. 
he, therefore, demanded that kertsen be both rebuked and punished. 
mrff demands that you 1 expeditiously and publicly rebuke lt. col. kerstens official statementas contrasted with his private christian faith belief which is not mrffs concern2 appropriately and visibly punish lt. col. kersten for his unconstitutional and ucmj-violating behavior; 3 apologize to your airmen and our turkish allies, and; 4 reaffirm an inclusive 39th air base wing command climate weinstein wrote. 
isnt it cute that he thinks that someone would be scared of his list? glad to report that col. john walker was not. 
christian news reports 
the air force places the highest value on the rights of its personnel in matters of religion by its members, he wrote. our airmen are sworn to protect our rights and liberties as americans, including the right of all airmen to practice their religious faith of to practice no faith at all. 
a second letter has been sent, but, so far, walker has not replied. 
it is possible that he has just chosen to ignore weinstein.

"comey bias exposed as fbi boss refused to call out russians for hacking before election by jason easley on mon, oct 31st, 2016 at 422 pm a new report is painting cia director james comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as comey sent a letter about hillary clinton's emails, but refused to call out russia for meddling in the election by hacking democrats. share on twitter print this post 
a new report is painting cia director james comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as comey sent a letter about hillary clintons emails, but refused to call out russia for meddling in the election by hacking democrats. 
cnbc reported  fbi director james comey argued privately that it was too close to election day for the united states government to name russia as meddling in the u.s. election and ultimately ensured that the fbis name was not on the document that the u.s. government put out, a former fbi official tells cnbc. 
. 
according to the former official, comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to a foreign power was trying to undermine the election. he believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election. comeys position, this official said, was if it is said, it shouldnt come from the fbi, which as youll recall it did not. 
director comey didnt want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm republican presidential nominee donald trump, but he had no qualms about sending a letter to congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election. 
with each new revelation and detail, it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that fbi director comey may have violated the hatch act with his letter to congress. it is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections. 
when the information was bad for donald trump, comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election. however, he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage hillary clintons campaign. 
it is becoming clear that comey has abused his power and must be removed as fbi director immediately.",133,736269,real

"comey must explain why he advised obama not to publicly accuse russia of hacking democrats by sarah jones on tue, nov 1st, 2016 at 126 pm comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the u.s. presidential election, and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as ""partisan"". share on twitter print this post 
russia did hack the democrats. so all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the u.s. election. 
but fbi director james comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the u.s. presidential election, and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as partisan. 
republican fbi director james comey advised the obama administration not to publicly accuse russia of hacking the dnc and more on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the nov. 8 election, officials familiar with the deliberations told the washington post. 
these sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the post on the condition of anonymity. 
there are a few reasons why comey might want to keep his agencys investigation of russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of clintons emails, which resulted from a republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless benghazi investigation that also cleared clinton, it seems odd that comey was going to stay silent on the russia matter. 
comeys decisions is especially odd given the reports that the russians have been communicating and coordinating with republican presidential nominee donald trump to the point that he is already compromised. 
only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the united states president. 
the same sources tell the post that comey made the decision to reveal the clinton emails to congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. 
not sure im buying that because if comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldnt have said anything at all, but that doesnt mean that his motives were nefarious. 
there might well be good reason for this  after all, this is the fbi and they cant tell us everything, but as of right now comey has mishandled this and appears to be trying to influence an election to help republicans. just because he is a republican and just because he has donated to republicans doesnt mean he isnt doing his job properly. 
but comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. he is under fire for good reason, as the explanations hes giving for these decisions dont make sense and are contradictory.",133,736269,real
"reality slaps donald trump in the face as u.s. economy roars back by sarah jones on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 227 pm donald trump's message that everything in the u.s. is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only trump can fix got slapped down today as the u.s. economy roars back. share on twitter print this post 
donald trumps message that everything in the u.s. is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only trump can fix got slapped down today as the u.s. economy roars back. 
the advance estimate of gdp for the third quarter of 2016 showed that the obama economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9. the conservative wall street journal headlined this news with, u.s. economy roars back, grew 2.9 in third quarter. 
jason furman, chairman of the council of economic advisers, summarized the numbers, real gdp grew 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending. 
this news flies in the face of donald trumps basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix. the trump economic plan creates at least 25 million jobs, boosts growth up to 4 percent, and is revenue neutral, trumps website claims. 
before these numbers, trumps previous problem was that trumps economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent, isnt revenue neutral and would destroy 11 million jobs. trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run. 
the conservative-leaning tax foundation found that trumps plan would cost the us trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by 10-16. trumps tax plan could cost the u.s. 11 million jobs. 
according to a report released at the end of july by moodys analytics, hillary clintons economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections. the analysis shows that, if implemented, the democratic nominees agenda would create 10.4 million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of 2.7 percent. 
under trumps plan, moodys estimated that unemployment would spike to 7 percent and over 3 million americans would be put out of work. the u.s. economy will weaken significantly if mr. trumps economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed, the june report said. the economy will suffer a recession that begins in early 2018 and extends into 2020even longer than the great recession. 
yikes. 
trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts. trump earned a pants on fire! from politifact for this claim made june 16th, 2015 in his presidential announcement speech, the last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product  was below zero. who ever heard of this? its never below zero. 
but also they note, finally, since trump was attacking obama for this bad quarter of growth, well just throw this out of the 42 quarters of negative growth since world war ii, 30 occurred under republican presidents and just 12 under democratic presidents. 
todays new economic numbers help clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under president obama. 
hillary for america senior policy advisor jacob leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say, todays gdp release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years but hillary clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. independent experts agree her plan would create good-paying jobs through investments in infrastructure, innovation and education. 
the economy is roaring back under president obama, and the numbers suggest that it does better under a democratic president. donald trump keeps saying clinton is 4 more years of obama, which makes a sunny case for her. 
trump is already struggling with just 11 days to go until the election on november 8th, and these numbers just added more weight to his uphill battle. reality has spoken, and it doesnt agree with donald trumps vision of america.",133,736265,real

every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the democrats. coincidentally, the democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. in 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in mitt romney. this year, the out-of-touch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross. 
the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top .01 percent. the rest of us will be their servants. 
the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class, the middle class who will soon be working class and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
look to mexico for your future  or any third world country. or to univisions jorge ramos. the ruling class in mexico is composed of european-looking, white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their spanish names in return. british settlers in america brought women with them. 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men.  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim. the victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family. 
one american detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing. 
when it comes to multiculturalism, you cant say, we love the empanadas  but we dont want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . this isnt an a la carte menu. we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing. 
as described in excruciating detail in adios, america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole, our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder!  when its committed by immigrants. 
thus, for example, where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest, child rape, the chattanooga tenn. times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling. 
and where i would have used the headline, illegal alien repeatedly raped 14-year-old girl at job site, the commercial dispatch in columbus, mississippi, went with the more subtle, columbus resident charged with molestation. 
immigrant women arrive in america, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
in 1989, brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood. the female head of the asian-american legal defense and education fund, margaret fung, applauded the ruling. 
somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. anything to keep the third world immigration flowing! 
in 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. 
when the news first broke, shaneequa jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants! 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for austin men. or two. 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin american-statesman texas, july 19, 2013 
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online, july 24, 2013 
needless to say, the new york times did not cover the mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. 
the ultimate primer on the blue-collar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome! 
by contrast, the times, and every major american news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was 11. but she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. 
those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. the defendants were african-american. the victim was mexican. 
that time, there were articles in the huffington post, gq, slate, salon and mother jones. it even made the new york times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. 
similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur, alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. one suspect was african-american, the other was a hispanic immigrant. only one made the newspaper. guess which one? 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes!, journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men. 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues. definitely not islam! 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened.  this attack also had nothing to do with islam. 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges. we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not.  in my experience, muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment. 
perhaps american men could do better, but, as american women may soon discover they never had it so good. 
manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america. they are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich. the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher. 
our country will be zimbabwe, but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe!

"comment on i just lost all faith in our deeply corrupt legal system and in the rule of law in the united states by redlucy i just lost all faith in our deeply corrupt legal system and in the rule of law in the united states   6th, 2016 
the fbi just gave hillary clinton the biggest gift in the history of presidential politics. two days before the election the fbi has announced that they are ending their investigation into hillary clintons mishandling of classified information. after reviewing the emails that were found on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and anthony weiner, fbi director james comey sent a letter to congress telling them that we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton. that means that there will be no indictment, and the path is now clear for hillary clinton to become the next president of the united states on tuesday unless an election miracle happens. 
these days it is unusual for a news story to hit me on a deeply emotional level, but this one sure did. when the fbi originally announced that they were renewing this investigation, it gave me a glimmer of hope that there may be a little bit of integrity left in our legal system. 
but after todays announcement i have lost all faith in our deeply corrupt system of justice. america has become a lawless nation, and the rule of law is completely dead in this country. 
yes, it is true that those of us in the general public do not know what was contained in those emails, and director comey says that nothing significant was found in them  
in a letter to lawmakers, comey said the fbi is standing by its original findings, made in july, that clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of state. 
the fbi investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation, comey said in the letter. during that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from hillary clinton while she was secretary of state, comey wrote. based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton. 
but of course the truth is that the fbi already had more than enough to go after clinton based on what they discovered the first time around. 
in the world of national security, if you transmit a single classified document via a channel that is unsecured, you will lose your security clearance in a heartbeat and it is quite likely that you will be prosecuted and sent to prison for mishandling classified information. 
in fact, two different members of the u.s. military were recently convicted for doing precisely that  
just last month, bryan nishimura, a california naval reservist, was sentenced to two years probation and a 7,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to removing classified material and downloading it to a personal electronic device. the fbi found no evidence he planned to distribute the material . 
last year, bronze star recipient and combat veteran chief petty officer lyle white pleaded guilty to storing classified documents on a nonsecure hard drive in virginia. he received a suspended 60-day sentence and a suspended 10,000 fine in return for the plea. white said the information was for training purposes to study and that he had no intent to communicate with anyone . 
neither of those individuals intended to mishandle classified information, and they certainly never intended to share it. 
but they were both convicted anyway. 
so what makes hillary clinton any different? 
during the initial investigation, the fbi found 113 emails that contained classified information  
clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the fbi investigation show that claim was incorrect . 
of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. fbi director james comey has said clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed. 
and i would be willing to bet that the fbi found some more classified emails that they had not seen previously among the 650,000 or so that they reviewed for this renewed investigation. 
but it doesnt matter now. hillary clinton is free as a bird even though she mishandled 113 classified emails, and it looks like she is going to become the next president of the united states on tuesday. 
as a law student and then later as an attorney working in washington d.c., i got to see just how deeply corrupt our legal system has become. 
but after today, i dont see how any american can ever have faith in the rule of law again. 
if the law does not apply equally to all persons at all times and in all circumstances, we might as well not even have a legal system. 
at this point, there is only one way that some sort of justice can be achieved in this case. and that is if the american people go to the polls on tuesday and vote to keep her out of the white house. 
it wont be perfect justice of course, but at least it would keep hillary clinton from getting what she wants more than anything else in life. 
the choice before the american people is very simple. hillary clinton is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency, and the extremely long laundry list of clinton scandals and crimes has been well documented over the past three decades. 
the voters know exactly what they are getting with her. and if they choose her anyway despite all of the things that have been revealed, that means that america is willingly choosing lawlessness. 
to most conservatives, this election is all about trump, but i believe that it is far more about hillary clinton. 
i am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in american history, and if the american people willingly choose hillary clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation. 
so let us pray for an election miracle, because right now donald trump is behind in most national polls and time is running out.",60,736275,fake

"'grand slam!' father-son film is smash hit for families print gappers team photo from every boy needs a hero 
just in time for the start of the 2016 major league baseball world series, wnd films has acquired the father-son baseball movie, every boy needs a hero, for immediate release on dvd. 
were confident that hero is a grand-slam movie that will build up families across america and restore luster to the game, said joseph farah, wnd founder and ceo. 
starring burgess jenkins, of remember the titans and nashville, and gregory alan williams, of miracles from heaven, this award-winning movie brings the love of baseball to hearth and home. it also features a powerful music soundtrack by three-time grammy winner michael omartian. 
get every boy needs a hero now at the wnd superstore! from the producers of alone yet not alone, the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children. 
according to dr. ted baehr, founder of movieguide,  hero is an excellent movie about god turning a mans heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father. 
dr. baehr added, the opening is powerful. the ending is heartrending. the drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. this is one of the few movies that movieguide can actually say go see it. keith harris and nick edwards as wynn and sammy heller 
hero opens with joe played by burgess jenkins coaching his son davids baseball team, the gappers, to the state championship. seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, joe returns to town. he had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. his wife, hannah, is stricken with cancer, while david is angry that joe left them. after hannahs funeral, joe moves back into the house, but david remains bitter. meanwhile, david is coaching the now hapless gappers; the team loses more than it wins. joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help joe reconcile with david. unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly practice times are limited, coaches cant make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a participation trophy. the beloved american pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games, let alone practices. so, joe starts his own league to turns things around. 
from the director of isaiah 910 judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero, a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship thats and set around americas pastime, baseball. 
one of the fathers joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison, mr. redding played by gregory alan williams. reddings career mirrors that of joe. hes been offered a big job in washington, d.c. like joe, hes lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family. in contrast, another gapper teammate has a father whos actually a prison inmate under redding. unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls, the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son, but he cannot due to prison rules. justin miles and burgess jenkins as david and joe finn in the film, every boy needs a hero 
what makes hero particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself.

washington times reporter bradford richardson wrote in his article, study blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players, that the austin institute, a texas-based think tank focused on family and societal issues, has commissioned a study titled, called out at home, which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball. 
from the director of isaiah 910 judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero, a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship thats and set around americas pastime, baseball. 
richardson writes 
kevin stuart, executive director of the austin institute, said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because it takes two to play catch. 
there is a long-standing connection between fatherhood and baseball, mr. stuart said, pointing to famous father-son tandems who have played in the major leagues and the prominence of father-son relationships in popular baseball movies such as field of dreams. 
baseball, he said, was made to be played by fathers and sons. 
baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle, where whats really necessary, or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills, is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you, mr. stuart said. 
anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball. 
famous father-son tandems  including ken griffey sr. and ken griffey jr., prince fielder and cecil fielder, and tony gwynn sr. and tony gwynn jr.  have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next. 
hero received a powerful endorsement from renowned christian author stormie omartian 
for such a time as this, hero is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son, who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball, farah said. 
baehr concluded, hero is a wonderful, faith-filled sports drama. it will touch your heart, your mind and your soul. gapper team dads from the film, every boy needs a hero",238,736264,real

"fox news just admitted it made up story about hillary being indicted for foundation comments 
the alt-right and other trump supporters were flush with excitement yesterday as their online echo chamber resounded with stories that hillary clinton was about to be indicted on the basis of the newly discovered emails on anthony weiners computer. today, of course, we learned that this was nothing but a bold-faced lied. while many of the more obscure right -wing blogs named nothing but imaginary sources to support their outrageous claims , the most legitimate source of the false story was none other than fox news. 
on november 2 fox news bret baier claimed that, according to two anonymous sources within the fbi, the agencys investigation of clinton would continue to likely an indictment. the very next day reality forced him to walk back those claims, which he called inartful, acknowledging that thats not the process. 
nonetheless, baier did not entirely disavow his ruse of an imminent clinton indictment, maintaining that there is confidence in the evidence. given that clintons indictment has been impending for months in the right-wing universe one would think that these shameless schemers would have wised up to the fact that its not going to happen  and for good reason . instead, every time there is the slightest mention of clintons emails, no matter how vague and clearly inconsequential , the alt-right rumor mill kicks into overdrive on its vicious crusade to smear the potential first female president in any way possible. 
in reality, there is absolutely nothing so far to suggest that there is anything incriminating in the most recent batch of clinton emails, and it has become increasingly clear that fbi director james comeys announcement of the renewed investigation was nothing but a cynical and hypocritical political ploy. in part the announcement was designed to fuel a new republican storyline that clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is under federal investigation. the demagogues making these claims conveniently ignore the fact that trump is under investigation in no fewer than 75 cases , including the rape of a 13 year-old girl. 
another disconcerting storyline in yesterdays firestorm of right-wing rumors is the political interference of trump supporters in the fbi. if baiers so-called anonymous sources really were fbi agents, it would represent yet another recent example of meddling in the presidential election by trump supporters at the supposedly impartial agency. in any case, the endless lies and distortions of the right-wing pseudo-media, from fox news down to the lowliest blog, are doing a tremendous disservice to the american people.",125,736272,fake

"the banishment of trump has begun as the american people are tuning him out by jason easley on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 1057 am it is a cruel reality of american electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for donald trump. share on twitter print this post 
it is a cruel reality of american electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for donald trump. 
despite the fact that trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged, stolen, or unfair, his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears. the latest washington post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by 12 points from 31-43. the number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from 47-37, and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from 34 to 28. even trump supporters are split 50-49 on whether or not votes will be counted accurately. 
part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that president obama did in addressing these concerns, but it is most likely that voters are treating trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election. 
one of the best indicators of a presidential elections outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win. 
hillary clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election, which is a hint of the way that people are voting. 
the process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the us two party system. losing candidates who refuse to go away, like sarah palin, are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up. 
trumps fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end. his words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level, which is why he still needs to be discussed, but as far as changing minds and winning an election, it looks voters are in the process of banishing trump from the political island.",133,736265,real
"11 stupid things vox.com's matthew yglesias has said  daily wire 11 stupid things vox.com's matthew yglesias has said by aaron bandler october 26, 2016 
matt yglesias of vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder, given his penchant for saying things that are mind-bogglingly asinine. apparently yglesias agrees with this sentiment matt yglesias deleted something like 30,000 tweets yesterday. clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations. 
fortunately, the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly. 
here are 11 things yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb. 
1. yglesias was convinced that people would love obamacare. that is, until he didn't . mattyglesias obamacare marker - which was solid as of 15 minutes ago - appears to no longer be markering pic.twitter.coma0eyximi8g  omri ceren cerenomri october 26, 2016 
his 2013 piece is still available though, and in it he whines about how supposedly ""the media, for non-ideological reasons, is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing."" yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that ""when obamacare becomes the status quo, people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten."" 
in other words, yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking. that all fell by the wayside when the obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of 25 percent. 
2. yglesias made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov. bobby jindal r. in a 2013 tweet that is now deleted, yglesias wrote, ""is bobby jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping?"" 
yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash, tweeting ""oh, fun. conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode."" 
eventually, yglesias backed down, tweeting ""for the record, now that i know more about jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff."" 
the irony of yglesias saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you don't say dumb stuff. mt mattyglesias its clear that jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff.  jon gabriel exjon june 18, 2013 
3. yglesias once ranted against ""dumb jewish politicians."" the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in 2009 that was seriously titled ""dumb jewish politicians,"" in which yglesias highlighted a passage from jonathan chait, who wrote in the new republic that then-sen. joe lieberman i-ct had to be stupid for not supporting the public option. 
""i suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary, or possibly the victim, of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers,"" chait wrote. ""trust me, its not true. if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes, most liberals would deride him as an idiot. with lieberman, we all suspect its part of a plan. i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn"" 
yglesias agreed 
ive long held a related theory about eric cantor. 
anyways, this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend. theres a whole bunch  boxer, cardin, feingold, feinstein, franken, kohl, lautenberg, levin, lieberman, sanders, schumer, specter, and wyden. its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted 
4. yglesias advocated for ending time zones. seriously. in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space, yglesias wrote a 2014 piece titled ""the case against time zones they're impractical  outdated."" yglesias pontificated 
northern idaho is connected via i-90 to spokane and seattle to its west, but not to boise to its south so the couer d'alene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time. india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a half-hour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time. 
yet while these zig-zags and 30-minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time, they serve a very practical purpose. it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings, calls, and other arrangements across time zones. the need to constantly specify which time zone you're talking about is a drag. commuting across time zones would be more annoying still, which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois' central time rather than indianapolis' eastern time. 
but the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations. it's to shift the world to one giant time zone. 
ygleasias then called for ""one time to rule them all""a phrase that prompted j.r.r. tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy 
if the whole world used a single gmt-based time, schedules would still vary. in general most people would sleep when it's dark out and work when it's light out. so at 2300, most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office. but of course london's bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap. the difference from today is that if you were putting together a london-la conference call at 2100 there'd be only one possible interpretation of the proposal. a flight that leaves new york at 1400 and lands in paris at 2000 is a six-hour flight, with no need to keep track of time zones. if your appointment is in el paso at 1130 you don't need to remember that it's in a different time zone than the rest of texas. 
pejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid yglesias's time zone piece was, writing at ricochet  ""i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place, but seriously, who cares? is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that matthew yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them? dont the people at vox have anything better to write about?"" 
apparently they don't. 
5. yglesias doesn't understand florida's geography very well. yglesias wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in 2007, in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami. 
""i'd been interested to know what, if anything, is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know,"" yglesias said. 
people immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldn't do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish. 
""yes, yes, commenters i know it's a freaking swamp but there's plenty of development on ex-swampland in florida -- hence all the canals and weird-looking lakes,"" an exasperated yglesias wrote in an update. 
except that the land is not ""ex-swampland,"" it's an actual swamp . maybe yglesias shouldn't write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud. 
6. yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fine...if you're a politician. yglesias found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for high-speed rail advocates to provide an ""unrealistically optimistic"" projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government. 
""for better or for worse, thats politics,"" yglesias wrote at thinkprogress . 
on twitter, yglesias attempted to justify it by writing ""fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do, yes."" 
and yet, yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter. 
yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch-22 when he told the daily caller to ""go f yourself"" when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident. 
7. yglesias once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate. the federalist 's sean davis pointed to yglesias writing in 2009 that the va was ""producing the highest quality care in the country. their turnaround points the way toward solving americas health-care crisis."" yglesias also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in 2013, ""will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans?"" this tweet was also deleted, and for good reason, since the va has caused 307,000 veteran deaths due to ""systemic"" problems with the agency. 
8. yglesias doesn't understand the purpose of the senate. yglesias wrote the following for thinkprogress in 2009, per the guardian  
if you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska, one from south dakota, one from new hampshire, two from maine, two from idaho, two from nebraska, one from nevada, two from utah, two from kansas, two from mississippi, one from iowa, two from oklahoma, two from kentucky, one from louisiana, two from south carolina, and two from alabama, the 28 of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator 11.98 percent of the american population. meanwhile, barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent 11.95 percent of the american population. 
now of course texas is also a big state though at 7.81 percent of the population it's a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators. so the point here isn't a narrowly partisan one, though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence. the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things. if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population, we have just 34 senators representing the above-average states even though they collectively contain 69.15 percent of the population. the other 66 senators represent about 30 percent of the people. if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution, nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them. 
in three paragraphs of rambling, incoherent nonsense, yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations. 
9. yglesias doesn't understand america's financial system. yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a 2013 slate column that there were ""far far far too many banks"" in the country, as there were 6,891 at the time. yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous 
1. they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes? this doesn't get better when you drill down to the less-bright and not-as-good guys. it gets worse. and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdic-ensured depositors, nobody is watching the store. in effect, the well-managed banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones. the dubious decision-making doesn't get as complicated as what you see on wall streetit's mostly just classic boom-and-bust pro-cyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems. 2. they can't be regulated since these banks are so small, they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs. so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them, small banks regularly get various kinds of carve-outs from regulations. and once the carve-outs exist, they create pressure for extension further up the food chain. other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation. 3. they can't compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account, you need both regulation and competition. but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesn't offer any real competition. having a large share of america's banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize big-time finance. 
davis debunked yglesias's argument, which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there haven't been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in 2013. 
""yglesias' arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anti-community bank talking points promoted by the big banks 'you guys, the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem. small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem. dont worry about the facts. just go with it.',"" davis wrote in the federalist . ""i'm actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation."" 
10. yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon. after reading a review of a booker t. washington biography, yglesias started thinking about ""'black conservative' political tradition,"" prompting him to write in a 2009 thinkprogress post, ""it's only extremely recently that the idea of an african-american aligning himself, à la clarence thomas, with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible. but even so, that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist."" 
this is patently false, as damon root explained in reason  
actually, the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black h.l. menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene, including schuylers unambiguously titled 1966 autobiography black and conservative. and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen. robert a. taft in the 1952 presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal... 
11. yglesias expressed joy when andrew breitbart died. following breitbart's death, yglesias tweeted  ""conventions around dead people are ridiculous. the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead."" 
this tweet has also been deleted, and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid, it's ghoulish, vile and reprehensible. and slate defended yglesias, stating that he ""is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion."" 
apparently slate believes that ""passion"" trumps basic human decency and a reasonable iq level, and yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities.",43,736264,real

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan. the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision. donald trump, you see, is racist because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my african-american. hillary clinton, on the other hand, is not anti-semitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a f-ing jew bastard. 
with a republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small, real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass. so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flat-out lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers, as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. 
in heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear. clinton, a year ago, flat-out said, the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment. to normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. 
meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal, when the accurate description is national security scandal. the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. the law does not require, as fbi director james comey falsely stated, an intent. nor is it relevant, as clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was hacked. 
five people who worked with or for clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. but the target, that is to say hillary clinton, was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. so why the immunity deals? who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares? 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy. this would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie, given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are under-employed. 
meanwhile, its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist gloria allred. allred, a clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers. one such accuser, juanita broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, hillary clinton verbally threatened her. 
hillary clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation. never. and only one national reporter, sam donaldson, has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation. ever. clintons answer? he referred donaldson to his lawyer, david kendall. donaldson quickly tried again, asking the then-president to simply deny it. same answer my attorney  speaks for me. and that was that. 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since 1949; who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk; who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different; whose charitable foundation engaged in pay-to-play in haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and non-donors went to the back of the line; who wants to gut the second amendment; who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis, russia and the chinese; and whose media compadres, including scribes with the new york times, washington post and cnbc, have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign. and she is now odds-on favorite to become the next president of the united states. receive larry elder's commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elder's alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email. name",238,736264,real

"bellwether? trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes bellwether? trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes company sees preference as 'early exit poll of orthodox jews' published 24 mins ago print 
washington  the campaigns of donald trump and hillary clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the white house in january. 
a company that makes trump and hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the orthodox jewish clientele. 
so far, the company, pic-a-kippa, has sold 331 trump yarmulkes to 65 for clinton. 
my kippa yarmulke company sells trump and hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more, uri turk, founder and chief kippa officer, told wnd. we see it as an early exit poll of the orthodox jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the trump kippas. 
pic-a-kippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret idf soldiers from miami. turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling trump and hillary custom kippas on its site since august, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. 
our mission is to help jews everywhere show and wear their jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas, the company says on its website. 
it donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the lone soldier center in israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. 
turk said while american jews have leaned heavily democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen orthodox jews, who make up over 10 percent of american jewry, vote republican in ever increasing numbers. he attributes that fact to the democrats putting daylight between america and israel. 
a number of influential jewish pro-trump organizations have emerged, chief among them jews choose trump and jewish democrats for trump. a recent poll of florida jews showed orthodox voters are leaning toward trump by a 3-1 margin. 
according to turk, pic-a-kippa has sold many trump kippas to a congregant of ivanka trumps synagogue on the liberal upper east side of manhattan and has gotten orders for trump kippas from israel, australia, britain and even mexico. pic-a-kippa has also gotten hate mail from jews unhappy they are selling the trump designs, he says.",238,736264,real
"4 new polls suggest that republicans are on the cusp of a total election disaster according to quinnipiac university  four-way races which list both presidential and vice-presidential candidates, except georgia and north carolina, where green party candidate jill stein is not on the ballot, show 
georgia trump at 44 percent to clintons 43 percent, with 8 percent for libertarian party candidate gary johnson. this compares to a 47  40 percent trump lead september 22; 
iowa a 44  44 percent clinton-trump tie, with 4 percent for johnson and 1 percent for green party candidate jill stein. trump led clinton 44  37 percent september 22; 
north carolina clinton edges trump 47  43 percent, with 5 percent for johnson. on october 3, clinton had 46 percent to trumps 43 percent; 
virginia clinton tops trump 50  38 percent, with 4 percent for johnson and 2 percent for stein. clinton was up 45  39 percent september 22. 
contrary to some republican hopes, donald trumps slide has not stopped. trump continues to lose support with men in iowa and georgia. north carolina appears to be slipping away from trump, and the republican nominee has blown his leads in iowa and georgia. 
the trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose florida, they will lose the election, but the signs are evident in the polling that the republican party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the white house in november. 
a trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for republicans that leads to additional democratic senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority. republicans could see their current record house majority gutted in a clinton landslide.

"trumps scandals versus hillarys scandals brilliantly exposed robert gehl asks if you remember back in 2001, when the clintons backed a u-haul truck to the rear-end of the white house and took off with a bunch of publicly owned furniture and other treasures? 
yeah that was pretty embarrassing. probably something you wouldnt want to repeat. 
but then again, youre not hillary clinton. 
according to another recently unclassified fbi interview, clinton and her staff were seen removing furniture and lamps from the state department offices early in 2009 as soon as she took office as secretary. hillary was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. 
the agent  who is now an investigator with the department of homeland security  said he had no idea whether or not the items were ever returned to the taxpayers. 
back in 2001, after the washington post broke the story, the clintons said they would reimburse the taxpayers 86,000 for the items they stole that were actually government property, lifezette reports . 
they also returned another 28,000 worth of furniture a few days later. 
in addition to stealing all that furniture back in 2001, youll recall they even removed the ws from all the keyboards in a juvenile and childish stunt to upset the incoming administration of george w. bush. 
theft of taxpayer items from the state department were not the only revelations in the fbi interview, the washington examiner is reporting . 
in its notes, the fbi writes prior to clintons tenure, being an agent on the secretary of states protective detail was seen as an honor and a privilege reserved for senior agents. however, by the end of clintons tenure it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her.",183,736263,fake
"trump repeats bogus claim that captain khan would still be alive if he were president 58 pm again, donald trump was not opposed to the war in iraq.   
ever since donald trump was lambasted by leaders in both parties for fighting with a gold star family and dishonoring the service of captain humayun khan, hes been trying out a new approach pretending khan would still be alive if he was president. 
khan was killed in 2004 in a suicide attack in iraq. 
when the republican was asked in an interview with abcs george stephanopoulos if he thinks he should apologize for the way he treated the khan family following the democratic national convention, he repeated this bogus claim.

as hillary clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign, donald trump was not opposed to the war in iraq from the beginning. had he been president at the time, the war still would have taken place because trump was in favor of it. 
in fact, trumps campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies. this would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that america gets mired in more conflicts, not less. 
for their part, the clinton campaign has continued to stand up to trumps attacks on the khan family. in an emotional new ad released days ago, capt. khans father recounts how his son died protecting everyone in his unit. khans father asked of trump, would my son have a place in your america? 
the answer to mr. khans question is a resounding no, as trump has promised to ban muslims  like the khans  from even entering the united states. for those living here already, a president trump would treat them like criminals.

iraqi analyst discloses plot to transfer al-baghdadi to libya
a prominent iraqi military analyst disclosed that riyadh and ankara had hatched plots to transfer isil leader abu bakr al-baghdadi from mosul to libya but the massive presence of the popular forces and russian fighter jets at the bordering areas of iraq and syria dissuaded them.
the two countries were working to take al-baghdadi to turkey either by moving him through mosul and kirkuk to the north or through al-qaem and al-ratba corridor to deir ezzur in syria and then to turkey to eventually transfer him to libya, safa al-aasam told iraqs al-malouma news agency on wednesday.
he added that the isil concluded that transferring al-baghdadi through tal afar region to raqqa in syria is also impossible given the massive presence of hashd al-shaabi popular forces in the southern front near beaaj district, northwest of the iraqi province of nineveh as well as the numerous flights done by the russian fighter jets over the syrian bordering areas with iraq.

hashd al-shaabi will soon start its operations in western mosul to cut the isils supply routes to syria and defuse the us plots to postpone the popular forces participation in the mosul operations, and general soleimani has also joined them as a military advisor, the arabic-language al-akhbar said quoting renowned iraqi figures.
no other source has yet confirmed the report.
washington is pressuring iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi not to allow hashd al-shaabi forces to participate in the mosul liberation operations.
spokesman of the iraqi popular forces ahmad al-assadi had confirmed in august that general soleimani would play a major role in operations to liberate mosul, stressing that his country is in dire need of iranian military advisors.
the presence of brigadier-general soleimani in the operations to free mosul and nineveh province is necessary and general soleiman is the greatest advisor that has helped the iraqi government in the war against the isil, al-assadi told fna.
hajj qassem soleimani is one of the most important military advisors of the islamic republic of iran who is in iraq at the invitation, demand and agreement of the iraqi government, he added.
stressing that the iranian advisors are in iraq at the demand of the iraqi government and have played a big role in most operations conducted by the popular forces, al-assadi said, they provided the iraqis with strong views and important consultations with respect to their experience and capabilities.
in relevant remarks in june, iraqi foreign minister ebrahim al-jafari underlined that general soleimani is in iraq to help the country in campaign against terrorism after receiving baghdads rigid request.
general soleimani is in iraq at the invitation of the iraqi government to provide military counseling to the iraqi forces, the arabic-language sumeria news channel quote d al-jafari as saying.
also in june, hashd al-shaabi commander abu mehdi al-mohandes underlined that general soleimani is helping the iraqi forces in their campaign against terrorism upon a request by the iraqi government.
the iranian advisors, headed by dear brother qassem soleimani, have been beside us since the start of war and his presence has happened upon the demand of the iraqi government and agreement of the armed forces top commander, mohandes said in an interview with sumeria news channel.
he, meantime, said that the iraqi nation is able to kick the terrorists out of iraq with the possibilities in their hands now, adding that hashd al-shaabi doesnt have any political plan and merely supports the political process.

"5 things you need to know about 'sanctuary cities'  daily wire 5 things you need to know about 'sanctuary cities' by aaron bandler november 16, 2016 
with donald trump elected to the presidency, one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities, cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens. the issue became front-and-center during the early portion of the republican primary when trump decried the murder of kate steinle by an illegal alien in san francisco, a sanctuary city. 
in response to the election of trump, leftist city leaders are digging in, officials in los angeles, chicago and boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal government's deportation efforts. here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities. 
1. sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law. some on the left have tried to claim that they're perfectly legal, but this is clearly false. as james walsh , former associate general counsel of immigration and naturalization services, explains, 8 usc section 1324 ""deals with those persons who knowingly conceal, harbor, or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states."" 
the fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means they're supporting a form of nullification, an irony not missed by victor davis hanson  
much of the rural west opposes the endangered species act. can wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders, when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways? many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales. could oklahoma city declare hand-gun purchases within its city-limits free of federal firearms statutes? perhaps little rock could ignore a supreme court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction. on what rationale would liberals in california object to such nullifications -- that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials? 
trump and the gop can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law. 
2. sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement. not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals, sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job. some police officers in the los angeles police department lapd expressed their frustration with the city's sanctuary city policy to heather mac donald in 2004 
we cant even talk about it, says a frustrated lapd captain. people are afraid of a backlash from hispanics. another lapd commander in a predominantly hispanic, gang-infested district sighs i would get a firestorm of criticism if i talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals. 
in that 2004 piece, mac donald documents how members of the lapd were able to recognize known gang members, but couldn't do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime  despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country. this is the case with other sanctuary cities as well. 
3. sanctuary cities are ""akin to roulette."" ""the odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ice for deportation,"" writes hanson. ""on the chance that some of their 10,000 released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of juan lopez-sanchez, officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down, or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens."" 
but the odds don't suggest this. hanson notes that according to mac donald, ""two-thirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of los angeles involved illegal aliens -- as well as 95 of outstanding murder warrants."" 
additionally, jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies found that in a nine-month timeframe in 2014, sanctuary cities shielded 9,265 illegals from deportation, 62 percent of which ""had significant prior criminal histories"" and 2,320 of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes, according to daniel horowitz at conservative review. 
""there is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught,"" writes horowitz. ""this is just a nine-month snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies. as of last year, 69 of them were still at large. so much for not being a flight risk."" 
according to vaughn , from january 2014 to september 30, 2015, sanctuary cities rebuked over 17,000 detainers, 68 percent of which involved ""individuals with a prior criminal history."" 
based on these statistics, it would seem that the odds are against the cities' residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens, which makes it no surprise that... 
4. crime has surged in sanctuary cities. the daily wire 's hank berrien reported on the following from louisiana attorney general jeff landry 
according to louisiana attorney general jeff landry, crime has risen in ""sanctuary cities"" across the nation. 
landry told the house judiciary committee's subcommittee on immigration and border security, that sanctuary city policies ""allow illegals to commit crimes, then roam free in our communities."" landrys appearance was prompted by the changed status of new orleans, where city police are now banned from asking an individual's immigration status. 
using recent statistics from los angeles, another sanctuary city, landry asserted, los angeles saw all crime rise in 2015 violent crime up 19.9 percent, homicides up 10.2 percent, shooting victims up 12.6 percent, rapes up 8.6 percent, robberies up 12.3 percent, and aggravated assault up 27.5 percent  sanctuary cities encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base."" 
this would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime . 
5. there are an estimated 300 sanctuary cities, counties, and states, according to vaughn. the full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here . do you live in a sanctuary city?",43,736284,real
"six gulf protectors arrested challenging gulf oil drilling email 
six gulf protectors were arrested outside the new orleans office of the us bureau of ocean energy management . they were taken into custody by federal protection service agents of the department of homeland security during an action by nonewleases.org urging president obama to cancel oil drilling leases in the gulf of mexico. 
we began the event in solidarity with those from the sioux nation who are standing up to the dakota access pipeline , said anne rolfes of the louisiana bucket brigade , one of the organizations participating. as gulf protectors we are calling on president obama to live up to his climate legacy and permanently cancel future leases in the gulf of mexico. 
the six arrested were alicia cooke, danil faust, alison kalnik, ben quimby, noah rahman, and reverend jim vanderweele. booked on federal charges of obstructing an entrance to a federal building, they were advised they have to each pay a fine of 530 or go before federal court for trial. 
alicia cooke, a member of 350 louisiana , explained why she was willing to be arrested. to maintain a livable climate, experts estimate that around 80 of existing fossil fuel resources must stay in the ground. at current consumption levels, we need to place an immediate moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure projects and we also must scale back on existing projects. the industry and government executives who dismiss our concerns out of hand because we drive fuel-powered vehicles or use air conditioning are missing the point. a transition to a renewable energy economy at the speed required by science will not be easy for any of us. it will take a full-hearted acceptance of climate science and an enormous collective will. but when you look at the climate math, it is quite literally our only choice. 
iris carter of concerned citizens of norco explained why she was there to protect the gulf. oil is killing people. just look at my own family. i grew up between a shell refinery and a shell chemical plant and when my mother and sister got sick, the doctors asked if we lived near pollution. its not fair. and now people have to go and fish in the gulf  after oil companies leave all that mess. look what they left from the spill that bp did. that was bad. and its no better. they keep going out and drilling and spilling in our gulf. and thats just not right. 
cheri fotlin of bold louisiana challenged the feds for excluding the public. the head of boem , abigail hopper, had promised to come down and meet directly with our communities who continue to be adversely affected by oil production in and along the gulf. at the last minute, she backed out. additionally, boem recently stopped allowing public participation at point-of-sale lease auctions. at every turn our voices have been oppressed by this federal agency. we deserve to be heard. if she wont come to us, then we have no choice but to go to boem ourselves to make our wishes known. we want protection. we want respect for our lives. no new leases, not here, not anywhere! 
four others were arrested in august at the same place and charged with state criminal trespass. their trial is still pending. 
the group promises to return and escalate their actions to protect the gulf.",39,736265,fake
"the simpsons react to their trump election prediction, and theyre not happy video on november 14, 2016 1136 pm  
in reaction to donald trumps victory, the simpsons decided to update their 2000 prediction of a trump presidency. 
in 2000, the show showed a glimpse into the future where president lisa simpson inherited an economic mess from president trump. well, now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality.

 the simpsons thesimpsons november 14, 2016 
hopefully, the financial despair the fictional president trump never becomes a reality, but seeing as he has no experience, is a businessman whos not as good as he says he is, and the simpsons have been right thus far, the futures looking pretty bleak. 
heres the original clip of president lisa simpson calling out a donald trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy 
early on into trumps campaign, the simpsons satirized the reality tv host turned president-elect by having homer simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into trumps hair. if we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality. 
now we have to reap what weve sown, or rather what the less than half of voting americans have sown considering trump only won with the electoral college and lost the popular vote to hillary clinton in his own words, big league. 
most of us with the simpsons were very wrong with the prediction as well.

"clintons are under multiple fbi investigations as agents are stymied clintons are under multiple fbi investigations as agents are stymied   source wall street on parade 
disgraced former congressman anthony weiner and his wife, longtime hillary clinton aide, huma abedin 
current and former fbi officials have launched a media counter-offensive to engage head to head with the clinton media machine and to throw off the shackles the loretta lynch justice department has used to stymie their multiple investigations into the clinton pay-to-play network. 
over the past weekend, former fbi assistant director and current cnn senior law enforcement analyst tom fuentes told viewers that the fbi has an intensive investigation ongoing into the clinton foundation. he said he had received this information from senior officials at the fbi, several of them, in and out of the bureau. see video clip from cnn below. 
that information was further supported by an in-depth article last evening in the wall street journal by devlin barrett. according to barrett, the probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity. barretts article suggests that the justice department, which oversees the fbi, has attempted to circumvent the investigation. the new revelations lead to the appearance of wrongdoing on the part of u.s. attorney general loretta lynch for secretly meeting with bill clinton on her plane on the tarmac of phoenix sky harbor international airport on the evening of june 28 of this year. not only was bill clintons wife under an fbi investigation at the time over her use of a private email server in the basement of her new york home over which top secret material was transmitted while she was secretary of state but his own charitable foundation was also under investigation, a fact that was unknown at the time to the public and the media. 
the reports leaking out of the fbi over the weekend came on the heels of fbi director james comey sending a letter to members of congress on friday acknowledging that the investigation into the hillary clinton email server was not closed as he had previously testified to congress, but had been reopened as a result of pertinent emails turning up. according to multiple media sources, those emails were found on the laptop of anthony weiner, estranged husband of hillary clintons longtime aide, huma abedin. 
weiner was forced to resign from congress in 2011 over a sexting scandal with more sexting scandals to follow . early this month, on october 3, the fbi raided weiners apartment in new york with a search warrant in hand and seized multiple electronic devices. at least one of those devices had been used by both weiner and abedin to send email messages. the search warrant had been obtained following a detailed report that had appeared in the daily mail newspaper in the u.k. in september, showing sordid, sexual emails that weiner had allegedly sent to a 15-year old girl in north carolina. according to the content of the published emails, weiner was aware that the girl was underage.",26,736268,fake
"abdde reform mu olacak yoksa parçalanacak mı?, yazan thierry meyssan abdde reform mu olacak yoksa parçalanacak mı? yazan thierry meyssan abddeki başkanlık seçimi kampanyasını gözlemleyen thierry meyssan, eski ve ağır uygarlık çatışmasının yeniden hortlamasını analiz ediyor. hillary clinton bu seçimlerde programların değil ama  amerikalıların kim olduğunu  bilme konusunun öne çıktığını açıkladı. cumhuriyetçilerin önde gelenlerinin donald trumpa verdiği desteği geri çekmesi siyasi sorunlardan daha çok kişisel tutumu yüzünden. yazarımıza göre abd, bugüne kadar farklı ufuklardan gelen ve özel bir cemaatin ideolojisine boyun eğmeyi kabul eden göçmenlerden oluşuyordu. bugün, ülkenin bizzat kendisini parçalama tehlikesi riskiyle çatlamakta olan bu modeldir.
voltaire i̇letişim ağı  şam suriye  26 ekim 2016 français español italiano русский english deutsch português ελληνικά عربي milenarist yani dünyanın sonunun yaklaştığına inanan seçmenlerin 73ü donald trumpu beğenmiyor. 68i demokratların adayı hillary clintonun orta sınıfların haklarını daha iyi koruyacağını; 64ü dış politika, 61i ise ekonomi alanında rakibinden daha iyi olduğunu düşünüyor. geçtiğimiz abd seçim kampanyası yılı sırasında, retorik derinden değişti ve iki kamp arasında beklenmedik bir bölünme ortaya çıktı. adaylar başta sadece siyasi konular servet dağılımı ya da ulusal güvenlik gibi üzerine konuşsalar da, bugün artık özellikle seks ve paradan bahsediyorlar.
cumhuriyetçi partiyi ki partinin başlıca liderleri adaylarından desteklerini çektiler- sabrını çatlatan ve siyasetin satranç tahtasını yeniden şekillendiren siyasi sorunlar değil, çok eski bir uygarlık bölünmesini hortlatan bu söylemdir. bayan clinton bir yandan siyaseten doğru olma çabası içerisindeyken, diğeri, yani  donald  eski  first lady nin ikiyüzlülüğünü ortaya seriyor.
hillary clinton, kocasıyla yattıklarını itiraf eden kadınları hedef almaktan ve lekelemekten çekinmemesine rağmen, bir yandan kadın-erkek eşitliğini savunurken, kendini kişisel nitelikleriyle değil ama eski bir başkanın eşi olarak sunarken, kadın cinsiyetine karşı duygularını gizlemediği için donald trumpu kadın düşmanlığıyla suçluyor. diğer yandan donald trump devletin özelleştirilmesi sürecini ve dışişleri bakanlığından randevu elde edebilmeleri için clinton vakfı aracılığıyla yabancı şahsiyetlerden para sızdırılmasını; obamacarein kuruluşunun yurttaşların değil ama sağlık sigortalarının yararına hizmet ettiğini teşhir ediyor ve işi seçim sisteminin doğruluğunu tartışmaya kadar götürüyor.
donald trumpun kendini ifade etme tarzının ırkçılığı yüreklendirdiğinin tamamen farkındayım ama clinton yanlısı medyaların çıkarttığı patırtıya rağmen bunun seçim tartışmasının merkezinde olduğunu hiçbir şekilde düşünmüyorum.
lewinsky olayı sırasında, başkan bill clintonun ulustan özür dilemesi ve selameti için rahipleri bir araya getirmesi önemlidir. oysa bir ses kaydı aracılığıyla benzer olgularla suçlanan donald trump, din adamları sınıfından yardım dilenmeden sadece hedef aldığı kişilerden özür dilemekle yetinmiştir.
bugünkü bölünme, abdde presbiteryenler, vaftizciler ve metodistler tarafından temsil edilen kalvinistlere karşı katolik, ortodoks ve luthercilerin değerlerinin isyanını yeniden gündeme getirmektedir.
her ne kadar iki aday da püriten gelenek içerisinde eğitilmiş olsalar da clinton metodist ve trump presbiteryen, bayan clinton babasının ölümüyle birlikte dinine geri döndü ve bugün silahlı kuvvetler genelkurmayının the family adı verilen ayin gruplarına katılıyor. trumpa gelince daha içsel bir tinsellik uyguluyor ve o kadar sık tapınaklara gitmiyor.
tabi ki, kimse yetiştirildiği şemalar içerisinde kapalı kalmıyor. ama düşünmeden hareket ettiğimizde, haberimiz olmadan bunları üretiveriyoruz. herkesin dini çevresi sorunu dolayısıyla önemli olabilir.
neler olduğunu daha iyi anlayabilmemiz için xviinci yüzyıl i̇ngilteresine geri dönmemiz gerekiyor. oliver cromwell, yaptığı askeri darbe ile kral i.charlesı devirir. bir cumhuriyet kuracağı, ülkenin ruhunu arındıracağı iddiasında bulundu ve eski hükümdarın kellesini uçurdu. kalvinin düşüncelerinden esinlenen sekter bir rejim kurdu, papaya bağlı i̇rlandalıları kitlesel olarak katletti ve püriten yaşam tarzını dayattı. aynı zamanda siyonizmi de tasarladı yahudileri i̇ngiltereye geri çağırdı ve filistinde bir yahudi devletinin kurulmasını talep eden dünyanın ilk devlet başkanı oldu. bu kanlı serüven,  britanyanın ilk iç savaşı  adıyla anılıyor.
monarşinin yeniden kurulmasından sonra, cromwellin püritenleri i̇ngiltereden kaçarlar. hollandaya yerleşirler ve aralarından bazıları mayflower gemisiyle amerikaya giderken  pilgrimler , bazıları güney afrikada afrikaneer topluluğunu kurarlar. xviiinci yüzyıldaki abd bağımsızlık savaşı sırasında, kalvinistlerin britanya monarşisine karşı mücadelesine yeniden tanık oluruz. bu mücadele, britanya tarihi güncel el yazmalarında  i̇kinci i̇ç savaş  olarak tanımlanır.
xixncu yüzyıldaki i̇ç savaş, güney devletleriyle genelde katolik kolonların yaşadığı kuzeydekileri daha çok protestan kolonların yaşadığı karşı karşıya geldi. galip gelenlerin yazdığı tarih bu çatışmayı köleliğe karşı özgürlük kavgası olarak sunuyor ki bu propagandadan başka bir şey değildir güney devletleri, britanya monarşisiyle bir ittifak anlaşmasına vardıklarında köleliği kaldırmışlardır. dolayısıyla da, püritenlerle i̇ngiliz tahtının çatışması yeniden karşımıza çıkar ki bazı tarihçiler bu yüzden burada bir  üçüncü britanya i̇ç savaşından  söz ederler.
xxinci yüzyıl sırasında, başbakan david llyod georgeun  konformist olmayan hıristiyanlarıyla  birleşik krallıkta yeniden ortaya çıkmasını saymazsak, britanya uygarlığının bu iç çatışması bitmiş gibidir. bunlar i̇rlandayı bölerler ve filistinde  yahudi ulusal yurdunu  yaratmaya girişirler.
ne olursa olsun, richard nixonun danışmanlarından biri olan kevin philips, bu iç savaşlarla ilgili geniş kapsamlı bir tez hazırlar, sorunların hiçbirinin çözülmediği tespitinde bulunur ve bir dördüncü çatışmanın duyurusunu yapar  1 .
40 yıldan beri kitlesel olarak cumhuriyetçilere oy veren kalvinist kilisesinin müritleri, artık demokratları destekliyor.
bayan clintonun abdnin yeni başkanı olacağından ya da bay trump seçildiğinde, hızlı bir şekilde ortadan kaldırılacağından şüphe etmiyorum. ama birkaç ay içerisinde, geridöndürülemez bir demografik gelişim temelinde seçmenler topluluğunun yeniden şekillenişine tanık oluyoruz. halkın dörtte birinden fazlasını bir araya getiren püriten kökenli kiliseler, demokratların kampına doğru kayıyor. modelleri tarihsel bir kaza gibi görünüyor. güney afrikada ortadan kalktı ve ne abdde, ne de i̇srailde daha çok hayatta kalması mümkün değil.
başkanlık seçiminin ötesinde, abd toplumu hızla gelişmek ya da yeniden parçalanmak durumundadır. gençliğin püriten vaizlerin nüfuzunu kitlesel olarak reddettiği bir ülkede, eşitlik sorununu başka yöne kaydırmak artık mümkün değildir. püritenler tüm insanların eşit olduğu ama eşdeğer olmadığı bir toplum öngörüyorlar. lord cromwell i̇ngilizler için bir cumhuriyet istiyordu, ama ancak papa yanlısı i̇rlandalıları katlettikten sonra. böylece bugün abdde bütün yurttaşlar kanun önünde eşittir, ama aynı yasal metinlerden hareketle, mahkemeler aynı cinayet ya da suçlarla ilgili beyazlar için hafifletici nedenler bulurken sistematik olarak siyahları mahkum etmektedir. ve eyaletlerin çoğunda, hız ihlali için dahi olsa ceza alınması durumunda, oy kullanma hakkı kaldırılıyor. bunun sonucunda, beyaz ve siyahlar eşittirler, ama bazı eyaletlerde, siyahi insanların birçoğunun aynı şekilde oy kullanma hakkı elinden alınmıştır. bu düşüncenin paradigması, dış politikada, filistinde  iki devletli çözümdür ; eşit, ama özellikle eşdeğer olmayan.
rahip carter, reagan, bush sr. ve jr.in her ikisi de pilgrimlerin torunlarıdırlar, clinton ve obama yönetimlerini, kendi ülkelerinin ideallerine aykırı bir biçimde vahhabiliği ve bugün de işi̇di desteklemeye püriten düşüncesi itmiştir.
geçmişte pilgrimler, plymouth ve bostonde abdnin ortak hafızasında idealleştirilen topluluklar oluşturdular. oysa tarihçiler biçimseldirler,  yeni i̇srail i oluşturduklarını söylüyorlardı ve  musanın yasasını  seçerler. tapınaklarına haç değil ama yasanın masalarını yerleştirirler. zaten hıristiyan olmalarına rağmen, yahudi yazmalarına i̇ncilden daha çok önem veriyorlardı. kadınlarını başlarını örtmeye zorladılar ve bedensel cezaları yeniden gündeme getirdiler.

the fbi investigation!!!! spread like wildfire last night. this is the result of the press, once again, taking republican smoke and claiming theres fire. 
this observation isnt mine along. the washington posts greg sargent pointed out that there is only an upside and no penalty for doing this  for both republicans and the press this is how gop hype-ahead-of-the-facts gets rewarded by media's willful perpetuation of smokefire effect. zero penalty. only upside.  
 greg sargent theplumlinegs october 29, 2016 
even though early polling shows there hasnt been an impact in swing states , and even though the majority of americans have already made up their minds, each time her emails are brought up hillary clinton falls in the polls. 
a gallup poll showed that emails are the most americans have heard about clinton. not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them  but the emails that she was already cleared on. 
even though one result of the comey letter has been to energize clinton supporters , at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency, this still isnt an acceptable practice. 
republican fbi director james comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent, obviously would impact an election that was then just 11 days out and is now 10 days out, and actually bore no information well, thats inaccurate. the letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared, but the damage has already been done. 
while ron fournier and others suggested that democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by comey was just more partisan folly, the truth is even more disturbing. 
by even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan, we are allowing the press to enable republicans to continue pretending there is no reality. 
in reality, no matter which side of the aisle you are on, its a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election. the reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties  for instance, its obvious that the fbi is investigating the trump campaign for coordination with russia, but we dont headline that because the fbi hasnt commented on that, because 
to do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections. 
so its really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan, even as the trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule. if the rule applies to donald trump, it should apply to hillary clinton. 
asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan. 
we must stick to reality. we must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable republicans to keep drinking the no-fact kool-aid. 
the press did the republican smoke is a real fire thing all through president obamas terms, at one point claiming he was implicated in benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a republican aide to read him said emails  and of course, it turned out that the emails didnt say what the aide told the reporter. but that was learned much later and as everyone knows, a lie travels faster than the truth. 
and now american voters in swing states who read papers will think the fbi is investigating clinton. 
so comeys letter did damage hillary clinton. even if she wins the election, the letter damaged her and down ballot democrats. 
the media never learns. they take republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact, every time. they look like fools to those who know there was no there in the comey letter, but the average voter doesnt live for political updates. 
the irresponsible damage is done.

"artificial intelligence robot says trump will win other writers 
an artificial intelligence ai system that correctly predicted the last three us elections says donald trump will win 
if trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since internet engagement began in full earnest.  sanjav rai, indian inventor of the mogia artificial intelligence system in 2004 
according to a report in the international business times ibt , the artificial intelligence ai system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the last three u.s. presidential elections has put trump ahead of hillary clinton in the race for the white house. 
the ai system called mogia was created in 2004 by sanjiv rai, founder of indian it company genic.ai. 
the system works by processing 20 million data points from public platforms including google, facebook, twitter, and youtube, the ibt explained. 
it then analyzes the information to generate predictions, taking into account data such as engagement with tweets and viewership of facebook live videos. 
if trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years, developer rai was quoted as saying. 
having already correctly predicted the winners of the democratic and republican primaries, the system found that people are 25 percent more engaged with trump than they were with barack obama at his peak in 2008the year he was elected president. 
while most algorithms suffer from programmersdevelopers biases, mogia aims at learning from her environment, developing her own rules at the policy layer and develop expert systems without discarding any data, rai said. 
in september this year, professor allan lichtman from washington d.c.s american university , told the washington post that trump is most likely to win based on a system of truefalse statement that he calls keys to the white house. 
professor lichtman, who, the newspaper added, had correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1984, said he based his predictions on 13 truefalse questions, where an answer of true always favors the reelection of the party holding the white house. 
if six or more of the 13 keys are false  that is, they go against the party in power  they lose. if fewer than six are false, the party in power gets four more years, he said. 
these keys include questions about who holds the most seats in the u.s. house of representatives, the lack of a significant third party campaign, the economy, the extent of a real policy change should a challenger win, the level of social unrest, foreign, and military policies. 
the keys have nothing to do with presidential approval polls or horse-race polls, professor lichtman said, going on to make it evident that he personally dislikes trump a great deal. however, on his system the democratic party has definitely lost five of the keys, and is well on course to lose a sixth, which, he said, would give the election to trump by default. 
the new observer has long predicted that trump can only win if at least 70 percent of whites turn out to vote, and that he takes at least two-thirds of the white vote. anything less than that will see a liberal minority white vote team up with the block nonwhite vote to grant clinton victorywhich was exactly how obama was twice elected. 
trumps only hope therefore, lies in previous non-voters turning out, a fact to which he alluded in a recent speech, where he mentioned that reports coming in from the early voting figures revealed a massive surge in people who had never voted before.",44,736273,fake

it is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties, the republic, and why we are where we are. 
on the left side of this picture, we have donald trump  a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian, the new president-elect of the united states. he points his fingers and smiles that apprentice smile as he makes a point. 
on the right side of this picture, we have barack obama  a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude, who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant. he sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud, the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office. and obama, rightly, looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes. 
behind obama sits a bust of abraham lincoln, his eyes downcast, mourning for his country. 
yep. 
greatest picture ever. 
this is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant. barack obamas image of himself is not accurate  to americans, obama is a reality tv show star. he transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfie-stick, celebrity-ridden sinkhole of hollywood glitterati, hobnobbing with glozell and macklemore, cracking wise about the presidency with jimmy kimmel before saying that a reality star like trump could never be president. 
this picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost, as obamas former pastor might put it. 
and then theres lincoln. 
lincoln, who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration, mourning behind barack obama, who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain. 
lincoln, who represented wisdom, mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd. given republicans domination of the senate and the congress, i have hopes for trumps presidency  i hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president, and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises  but trump occupying lincolns office is, at best, a jarring visual.

williams is also concerned that his lack of a reference to explain how hes spent the last few years of his life might count against him in the job market, with employers as far afield as russia, zimbabwe and venezuela refusing to accept his word as an expert that hes good at controlling electoral outcomes. 
sources inside the democrat party have highlighted this as just the first american job lost by trump and warned there could be many more, specifically in the polling and political punditry industries.

on top of that, from what i infer from this piece, which is not at all clear on what trump supposedly did it tries to make his sin about failure to report, which sounds like a stretch; the irs does have audit powers, it still appears that lee sheppards analysis of why what trump did in 1995 was kosher then but not kosher later is the best account to date. and that was out a full month ago. her article specifically discussed why the cancellation of debt income did not appear on his tax return at the time. i am putting the key part of her discussion it was unpaywalled for weeks but now tax analysts has hidden it again at the very end of this post so the geeky can see what a stretch the times treatment is.",115,736269,fake

on tuesday, the fbi released documents related to a 2001 closed investigation into a pay-to-play scheme between former president bill clinton and marc rich, a man he granted a last-mine pardon. richs ex-wife, denise, donated more than 1 million to various clinton and democratic entities, including the democratic national committee, hillary clintons new york senate campaign and the clinton foundation. release reminds voters that the clinton white house and clinton foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning pay-to-play allegations. new files include one entry which shows that the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed prior to the rich pardon. roger adams, the u.s. pardon attorney at the time, testified to congress in feb. 2001 that none of the regular procedures were followed ahead of the rich reprieve. former attorney general eric holder is also mentioned in the file. it cites holders testimony that he was the only person who worked at doj  he was deputy attorney general at the time  about the rich pardon. clinton campaign press secretary brian fallon absent a foia litigation deadline, this is odd. will fbi be posting docs on trump's housing discrimination in '70s? fbi the fbis records management division receives thousands of foia requests annually which are processed on a first in, first out fifo basis. 
washington, dc the fbi on tuesday released documents related to a now-closed federal investigation of an alleged pay-to-play scheme involving bill clinton and the clinton foundation. 
the documents, which are heavily redacted, regard the investigation of clintons last-minute pardon of marc rich, a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the u.s. for tax evasion. 
the jan. 20, 2001 pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandal-plagued clinton administration. richs ex-wife, denise, donated more than 1 million to various clinton and democratic entities, including the democratic national committee, hillary clintons new york senate campaign and the clinton foundation. 
the release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized. but the dump is noteworthy for two reasons. it reminds voters that the clinton white house and clinton foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning pay-to-play allegations. the clinton foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple fbi field offices. 
the fbi issued a statement late tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a foia request. 
the fbis records management division receives thousands of foia requests annually which are processed on a first in, first out fifo basis, the statement reads. 
by law, foia materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the fbis public reading room shortly after they are processed. per the standard procedure for foia, these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the fbis public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.",203,736270,fake

"moving your computer off grid carmela tyrell november 1, 2016 moving your computer off grid 
more than a few preppers feel that as long as they can provide food, shelter, water, and basic medical needs for themselves and their families, nothing more is required. other preppers may feel that self defense, power generation, education, and machine repair are skills that will be required in the post crisis world. 
sadly, many preppers and also off-gridders tend to ignore or underestimate the need to have a computer that can be used to help make it easier to survive. 
in all likelihood, these are also the people most likely to have serious problems in the post crisis world because they do not have a computer available to help meet a range of goals. 
computers and prepping can get along 
a computer cannot hunt a deer for you, boil water, or make a pair of shoes, obviously. on the other hand, any computer with a connection to the internet can help you find out how to do these things and much more. when you find good information, it is also very easy to store those files on your computer so that you can read them and work with them whenever you want. 
and if you are in a situation where internet access is still available, you can use your computer to contact friends and loved ones as well as people that might be able to help you get through a crisis. then you can certainly relate to the quandary of many preppers that are finding out it is becoming impossible to make or obtain raw materials that would be needed in a major crisis scenario. 
on the other side of the equation, many of the items you need for basic prepping can still be purchased online. all you really need is a prepaid debit card and an internet connection so that you can find websites where you can place your orders. not only will you be able to get the supplies you need, you will also have a much wider selection of other goods to choose from. 
regardless of whether you are interested in the best quality gun cleaning kits, need a certain type of fishing reel, or need good quality vintage hand tools, you can find them all online. in fact, even if you are disabled, you may be able to find customized materials and tools that have been modified to meet your needs. 
most people dont realize just how important it is to network with preppers from diverse geographic regions and make plans for bugging out that include those friends and connections. consider what would happen if an earthquake or hurricane strikes your area. 
if you only have friends and family in a local, or small area, chances are everyone will be affected. if you have friends in other states that might be able to offer temporary shelter or help you make a new start, then you will be well ahead of the game. 
in these times and beyond, both money and barter systems are vital for exchanging needed goods and services. a computer is very important for expanding your trade and marketing options. it is also very important for securing alternative currencies that may play a vital role in remaining solvent in the face of currency collapse. 
most people would be truly amazed at how easy it is for the average consumer to secure foreign currencies, keep a good supply of them, and even use them as down and dirty form of currency trading or flipping. 
the tough choice on the best devices 
obsolete devices may still be very useful because certain older technologies are easier to work with and may be safer than newer devices that are routinely overclocked or are based on unstable hardware platforms. 
if you are interested in newer devices, here are some categories, brands, and models that you can start off with for each category of device 
desktops 
if you are primarily interested in a conventional desktop computer, my own experience leads me to believe the best option is to build the computer yourself so that you know exactly what parts are being used and how best to optimize the bios this is where you can determine how fast the computer will run, whether or not the system can boot from a usb drive, and other aspects of basic operation settings. 
since modern computer chips tend to run hot, it is very important to provide plenty of ventilation and cooling options inside the case. if your cpu and motherboard kit come with sub-par heat conducting gel, do not hesitate to find the best on the market. it is also very useful to add extra fans and other cooling devices right inside the case. 
always remember, the cooler you can keep the chips during operation, the lower your chances of erratic freeze-ups or even ruining the chips. 
insofar as other vital parts such as hard drives, cddvd drives, and video cards, it truly depends on your personal tastes. 
you will need a dedicated video card to gain access to these specialized chips that will reduce wear on the cpu and enhance computer performance at the same time. be sure to study gamer forums and video editing forums to find out which video cards work best with specific cpu and motherboard combinations. a bad fit between these parts can truly be a disaster. 
memory cards ram are yet another tricky, yet vital area of the computer that you will need to think about. this is also one area where only the best will do. it is better to go with the fastest cards that the motherboard will take, and also from the best rated vendor. 
laptops 
unlike desktop computers, you will have far less control over what parts are found inside the case. before purchasing a laptop, be sure to find out the model number of the cpu and motherboard. from there, you will need to look up the chipsets to find out what the optimal clock speeds are. 
i have seen more than one laptop burn up at around the 1 year mark because a sub-part mother board with a slower timing chip was paired with a faster cpu. since most buyers do not ask about the motherboard model, there was no way for them to find out that they basically had an overclocked system that was going to fail very quickly. 
overall, i can safely say that i dont recommend spending 3  4 times as much money on a laptop when i can choose a much cheaper tablet and optimize it with less intensive apps. the only advantage a laptop might have over an off grid tablet is that it is easier to customize the programs. 
tablets 
an unlocked tablet will give you just about everything you need for basic document access and communicating with others. you can also choose apps that will enable you to create your own apps and carry out other more complex tasks. 
tablets also have the advantage of taking far less power than a desktop or laptop computer. they can easily be recharged on a portable solar pack, and it is also fairly easy to bypass the battery. 
insofar as brand names, i tend to favor lenovo, but have also found alldaymall tablets to work well. the alldaymall tablets are also a good bit cheaper, so you can purchase more of them and put them in your bug out bag as well as other locations. 
smart phones 
when it comes to a comfortable viewing experience combined with relatively low power usage, larger tablets will work much better than smart phones. that being said, in a something is better than nothing or a vital tool for your edc, few things can rival a good quality unlocked smart phone. 
while i recommend a 10 tablet for bug out gear, a 5 smart phone is truly more than enough for edc. not only a phone this size fit easily into a purse or backpack, it is even easier to power than a larger tablet. 
they also work well for reading a range of documents and will give you a good sized window for viewing videos. you can also hook up a folding keyboard and be able to carry out a number of tasks that would be difficult using the screen keyboard. 
the challenge on providing a steady source of power 
today, the vast majority of computers have sub par power supplies that make them more susceptible than ever to fluctuations in power coming into the system. 
as our electric grid continues to crumble, rolling blackouts, brownouts, and line voltage fluctuations caused by excess usage during peak hours will shorten the life cycle of many computers. if you are generating your own power, it is just as important to make sure you know how to keep the current going into your computer as steady as possible. 
there are some things you can do now, as well as consider when building a power system that will help you get the most out of every computer that you own. click here to subscribe to survivopedias newsletter and get the free report on how to take your computer off grid. 
understanding the impact of utilization 
no discussion about preparing your computer hardware for off gridding would be complete without at least touching on the resource cost involved in each program that you run on the system. for example, if you have a simple word processor program with no fancy graphics, it will take up far less processor and memory resources than one that has funny critters dancing around all over the place. 
apps that automatically play videos or programs that automatically play music also shorten the hardware life of your computer. therefore, when it comes to choosing the best computer for your off grid or prepping needs, it is always important to study benchmark tests and hardware longevity tests under certain loads. 
once again, you will find some of the best and most accurate information in the gaming forums. 
important parts to keep on hand 
for each device in your edc, bug out bag, or other location, there are some important parts that can help double or even triple the useful lifespan of your computer. even if you lose some functionality, the main parts should still work for 2  3 decades on desktop units, and up to 10 years on laptops, tablets, and smart phones. start off by buying all of your devices brand new and with the maximum warranty available. if something breaks down during the warranty period, let the manufacturer or repair center take care of the problem. buy at least 3 to 5 non-functioning devices that are compatible with the make and model of each device. usually, you can pick these units up for around 10 to 20 of the cost of a brand new device. you can choose different manufacturers as long as the parts are fully interchangeable with your device. you will use these devices to learn how to make repairs, and also for spare parts if something breaks down on your main device. since ram chips take the most abuse on any computer system, keep a few spare ones on hand. have at least one extra power supply for desktop units. unlike other parts of the system, you should never open up the case on the power supply unless you have a good bit of experience working with electronic devices. never forget that the capacitors inside these power supplies may not be fully discharged, and that touching them or a live circuit can cause death or severe injury. keep at least 2 usb hubs handy that also have the capacity to power any device you hook up to them. when connecting devices to the usb ports on your computer, try to never at least one pair of ports. 
what happens when the battery dies? 
if you have been thinking about using a smart phone or tablet as a place to store important survival information, you may hesitate because you know that the battery can easily be ruined by over charging , or that it will wear out sooner rather than later. 
while some devices will continue to work while the battery is charging, others will not. if you have a device that will not work while charging, you will need to remove the battery and apply current directly to the device. 
in this scenario, you must know how to keep the voltage and amperage as stable as possible before they reach the device. you can make your own controllers for this purpose then hook them up to solar panels or anything else that you will be using as a power source. 
just remember that you power controller may also need to go safely from ac to dc current as well as match the voltage and amperage needs of the device. if you arent sure how much power to provide for laptops, tablets, or smart phones, just go by what the battery is rated for. video first seen on preparefortheunexpected . 
basic toolkit 
it will not be of much use to have plenty of parts on hand, and then no way to install them or make good use of them. here are the most essential tools you will need for building computers or making repairs chip extractors for chips that are installed in sockets high heat conducting gel precision and larger size screwdriver kit magnifying glass low wattage solder iron, solder, and flux suitable for computer parts desoldering bulb",170,736269,fake
"'grand slam!' father-son film is smash hit for families print gappers team photo from every boy needs a hero 
just in time for the start of the 2016 major league baseball world series, wnd films has acquired the father-son baseball movie, every boy needs a hero, for immediate release on dvd. 
were confident that hero is a grand-slam movie that will build up families across america and restore luster to the game, said joseph farah, wnd founder and ceo.

according to dr. ted baehr, founder of movieguide,  hero is an excellent movie about god turning a mans heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father. 
dr. baehr added, the opening is powerful. the ending is heartrending. the drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. this is one of the few movies that movieguide can actually say go see it. keith harris and nick edwards as wynn and sammy heller 
hero opens with joe played by burgess jenkins coaching his son davids baseball team, the gappers, to the state championship. seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, joe returns to town. he had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. his wife, hannah, is stricken with cancer, while david is angry that joe left them. after hannahs funeral, joe moves back into the house, but david remains bitter. meanwhile, david is coaching the now hapless gappers; the team loses more than it wins. joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help joe reconcile with david. unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly practice times are limited, coaches cant make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a participation trophy. the beloved american pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games, let alone practices. so, joe starts his own league to turns things around.

one of the fathers joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison, mr. redding played by gregory alan williams. reddings career mirrors that of joe. hes been offered a big job in washington, d.c. like joe, hes lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family. in contrast, another gapper teammate has a father whos actually a prison inmate under redding. unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls, the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son, but he cannot due to prison rules. justin miles and burgess jenkins as david and joe finn in the film, every boy needs a hero 
what makes hero particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself.

washington times reporter bradford richardson wrote in his article, study blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players, that the austin institute, a texas-based think tank focused on family and societal issues, has commissioned a study titled, called out at home, which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball. 
from the director of isaiah 910 judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero, a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship thats and set around americas pastime, baseball. 
richardson writes 
kevin stuart, executive director of the austin institute, said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because it takes two to play catch. 
there is a long-standing connection between fatherhood and baseball, mr. stuart said, pointing to famous father-son tandems who have played in the major leagues and the prominence of father-son relationships in popular baseball movies such as field of dreams. 
baseball, he said, was made to be played by fathers and sons. 
baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle, where whats really necessary, or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills, is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you, mr. stuart said. 
anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball. 
famous father-son tandems  including ken griffey sr. and ken griffey jr., prince fielder and cecil fielder, and tony gwynn sr. and tony gwynn jr.  have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next. 
hero received a powerful endorsement from renowned christian author stormie omartian 
for such a time as this, hero is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son, who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball, farah said. 
baehr concluded, hero is a wonderful, faith-filled sports drama. it will touch your heart, your mind and your soul. gapper team dads from the film, every boy needs a hero",238,736264,real
"woman facing jail for giving water to thirsty pigs contact us woman facing jail for giving water to thirsty pigs pigs have been known to courageously jump into water to rescue drowning children., but this woman is facing jail for giving water to pigs that were in ""sever distress""   , world  0 comments 
giving water to thirsty pigs on a hot day can now lead to jail time, as has been proven by a toronto woman who is on trial and facing sentencing for doing just that. 
anita kranjc tells her story  
on a scorching hot day in june 2015, i gave water to thirsty pigs on board a transport truck headed for the slaughterhouse. as the now famous video of the incident shows, the driver jumped out of the cab, telling me to stop. i replied with a reference to the bible jesus said, if they are thirsty, give them water. 
the driver shouted back, these are not humans, you dumb frickin broad! 
he called the police, and now im on trial in a canadian court for criminal mischief. 
when someone is suffering, i believe it is wrong to look the other away. it doesnt matter if the sufferer has two legs or four or asks for help in words we can understand or with body language that is just as easy to comprehend. leo tolstoy, an ethical vegetarian and one of my inspirations, wrote, we should take pity on animals in the same way as we do on each other. and we all know this, if we do not deaden the voice of our conscience inside us. 
the pigs i was trying to help on that fateful day were undoubtedly suffering. crammed into a transport truck on a sweltering day, these helpless animals  covered with their own excrement, being crushed together and slowly suffocating from heat  stared at me through the trailers metal slats with their pleading eyes. as dr armaiti may, a veterinary expert, testified during my trial, some of the pigs were foaming at the mouth and in severe distress, appearing to breathe as quickly as 180 breaths per minute. 
i think we have not only a right but also a duty to help suffering animals. toronto pig save , the group that i helped start with my dog mr bean in 2010, has continued to give water to thirsty pigs to this day. our approach is to collectively bear witness to ill-fated animals at the end of their miserable lives and hold weekly vigils outside slaughterhouses. 
a slaughterhouse might seem like the last place that animal lovers would want to be, but for us  as for the quakers, greenpeace and similar groups  bearing witness is about being present at sites of great injustice. our personal contact puts a face on the nameless numbers, to borrow from charles dickens, and helps people see animal victims as unique individuals who want to live. 
theres little doubt in my mind that if those were dogs in distress in that truck instead of pigs, my actions would be applauded and it would be the driver facing charges instead. this double standard should have everyone questioning the ethics of the meat, dairy and egg industry, our legal system and our food choices. like dogs, pigs are friendly, loyal and sensitive animals who have a strong sense of self and intelligence. they are playful and affectionate they love to snuggle. they feel love and joy, but also pain and fear. they possess protective feelings for their families and friends. pigs have been known to courageously jump into water to rescue drowning children. 
in esther the wonder pig, a new york times bestseller , esthers human dads attest to the porcine internet stars big personality, her keen intelligence and her sense of humor. our laws need to be changed to reflect this all animals should be treated as thinking, feeling individuals under the law, because that is what they are. they are not property, nor cogs in the machine, with numbered tags slapped on their ears. 
humans need to recognize that we are also animals and that we are all interconnected. we are like animals in all the ways that matter  we feel pain, we suffer, we grieve, we are afraid of being killed and we get thirsty on a hot day. by showing people this, we hope we will reach their hearts so they will feel what animals feel. then finally we will be able to end the horrific suffering at farms and slaughterhouses and shift towards a nonviolent plant-based economy. 
we are all in this together, humans and pigs. i am, quite literally, because i am facing jail time for giving pigs some small comfort in their final moments. my trial resumes 1 november. the cruelty inflicted on pigs at animal farms and slaughterhouses touches all of us, by harming animals, by polluting the environment, by harming our health and our conscience when we consume the products of this suffering. by bearing witness to animals in distress, we discover the unity of life.",242,736265,fake
"guardian plays robin to mi5s batman     information guardian plays robin to mi5s batman by jonathan cook
 today the guardian offers decisive confirmation that it is only too willing to serve as an establishment mouthpiece. it proudly announces that it is the venue selected by andrew parker, the head of mi5, britains fbi, to receive the agencys first-ever newspaper interview.
if the guardian were a proper independent newspaper, it would regard this interview as a stain. instead it bills it as a front-page exclusive. exclusively, the guardian has been given the chance to regurgitate mi5s propaganda  propaganda designed to help stoke a new cold war with russia.
in fact, this is not an interview as the guardian claims, for the simple reason that the papers two interviewers  one of them its deputy editor, paul johnson  have no basis on which to question the quality of the classified information they are being fed.
everything parker tells them could have been guessed at without the interview
the russians under vladimir putin are an evil empire; islamic jihadists are everywhere but mi5 is brilliant at foiling their terror attacks; the increased budget mi5 has received is entirely justified because it is doing such a brilliant job of foiling terror attacks; mi5s extra powers to surveil us all are necessary to foil those terror attacks; whatever happens with brexit, mi5 will continue doing a brilliant job protecting the british people; mi5 is determined to become a friendlier place for women and minority ethnic applicants. this isnt journalism, its the very definition of stenography.
even the guardian seems to sense that its readers might wonder why this interview is being published in their newspaper. but rather than discuss why the guardian would want to publish an interview with parker, the paper asks the opposite question why has mi5 chosen the guardian? this is framed in a way to make it look as though parker has entered a combative environment in coming to the guardian. the paper reminds us that it broke the edward snowden story.
in fact, the guardians snowden revelations seem like another era. remember that the guardian got access to snowdens documents only via their star columnist glenn greenwald, who has since departed after what appeared to be an increasingly troubled relationship, especially after the snowden revelations. instead parker is once again given an opportunity to attack snowden, accentuating the damage that was done to the work of british and allied intelligence agencies by snowdens efforts to bring to public attention the systematic and secretive invasions of our privacy.
the guardian is in far more comfortable territory playing robin to mi5s batman.
so why has parker selected the guardian rather than, say, the more obviously establishment london times?
because the guardians articles are not behind a paywall and so are easily accessible to anyone online? because it has become the preferred british news source for american elites, whose own media are even more servile to power? because the guardians unjustified reputation for leftwing and critical journalism will bestow on this mi5 press release the necessary pretence that parker has been subjected to tough questioning from the guardian? or because parker knew that the guardian would be as docilely accepting of his propaganda as any rightwing outlet of the corporate media?
draw your own conclusions.

"trick-or-treaters get their socks rocked by badass hillary pumpkin outside trick-or-treaters get their socks rocked by badass hillary pumpkin outside posted on october 31, 2016 by robert rich in politics share this 
an incredible video is being shared on social media after someone wanted to go political with their jack-o-lantern carving this year. unfortunately for hillary clinton, this badass pumpkin seemed to center around her  and it will surely knock the socks right off any trick-or-treater headed to their house tonight. 
halloween is a fun time for many people  especially families with younger ones. however, it seems that a few homeowners decided to try and entertain the adults that may cross their path. proving just that is a video shared to the facebook page called  uncle sams misguided children , which shows how one person went political with theirs. 
as can be seen in the short clip , the jack-o-lantern was emptied and carved to look like a set of jail bars. making it just that much better, the person responsible for carving the pumpkin actually stuffed a picture of hillary in there to make it appear as though she is in prison  where she belongs. 
within just a few short days, the video has already been seen over 3 million times with that number on the rise. however, if you think people on social media are ramped up over the ingenious carving, you can imagine the reactions that thing will get from trick-or-treaters tonight. 
as it turns out, the cool idea actually sparked a bit of a movement with several other people doing the same. in fact, in order to make it crystal clear, others even wrote the words hillary 4 prison on their creations as well",108,736268,fake

it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election, said scott dworkin, senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump. it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house, just to undermine her campaign. comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america, not investigating our soon to be president-elect hillary clinton. 
outrage is growing over comeys actions as details about the fbi investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with clinton, her emails, or her server. 
director comeys motives for sending the letter 11 days before a presidential election have been questioned by both republicans and democrats. 
if comeys actions were politically motivated, he would be in violation of the hatch act.

this type of language from someone who used to be  and thankfully no longer is  a member of the united states congress is abhorrent, but its also to be expected in the trump era of american politics. 
after all, not long ago trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate supreme court judges. 
if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks, the republican nominee said. although the second amendment people  maybe there is, i dont know. 
more recently, trump said that hed like to see what happens if clintons bodyguards were disarmed. 
i think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. disarm immediately, he said. take their guns away, lets see what happens to her. 
not only does walshs rhetoric align perfectly with what trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign, but its also a continuation of dangerous language that the former republican congressman seems to enjoy using. 
earlier in the year, when five police officers were gunned down in dallas, walsh blamed president obama, tweeting this is now war. watch out obama. watch out black lives matter punks. real america is coming after you. 
before trump hit the scene, this type of rhetoric existed, but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party. now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee.

screen capture from in the now video a tale of two cities it was the best of times, it was the worst of times the best of times  thats mosul. the liberation of the city from isis is going apace, with the us air force assisting iraq. yes, the resistance is fierce, and there will be door-to-door fighting, but the day of deliverance is coming -- a summary of npr this morning. 
no war crimes, not even any mention of civilian casualties under the euphemism of collateral damage."" and mosul is never called ""a city under siege""! 
the worst of times  thats aleppo, ""a city under siege."" this is where dictator assad and the russians are deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure under the condemnation of the western world for war crimes and crimes against humanity. thus speak the parrots, with one voice, following mark c. toner's press briefings. and npr is there to remind us that kerry wants russian war crimes investigated ' russia's bombing of civilians in syria ""beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes.""'  and to remind us that russia is bombing hospitals . 
never a mention of the besieged being isis!  
listening to cnn and npr national pr, no one would ever guess that its the same struggle in each city, a struggle to liberate innocent civilians from the headchoppers of isis. but in mosul, npr acknowledges that the innocent civilians are forced to stay and serve as human shields for isis. 
your retired latin prof translatorcommentator keeps up with the help of facebook friends in 35 countries. comparing the international posts and comments with the american ones points out the irony. one of them, in romania, has been advised to stop watching rt and other russian-biased sources.  
but in romania, there is no access to fox, cnn, or even to npr. so what is the poor rumanian to do?  and in another bingo for godwins law, the one advising against trusting rt calls trump another hitler. 
in the following response to a report of 300 civilians killed in a us airstrike,  
there is a mix of the rational, yet it is still written through the lens of cnn and the rest of western msm i am a little defensive that some of these stories have come from rt not this one when russia is deliberately targeting civilians and basically you could argue we need to try harder to avoid them.  it is an area with a high damned if you do potentially causing collateral deaths and damned if you don't thus allowing isis to spread and kill civilians directly quotient.  to which the only possible reply  
look at what you wrote! our airstrikes cause ""collateral damage;"" russian airstrikes ""deliberately target civilians."" the collusion of the western press with the washington blob took a month or two to take hold there was a time, early in 2014, when talking heads were saying stuff like ukraine should just make the best deal they can with russia. one retired french politician noted there is no sense getting involved in matters of what used to be internal boundaries of the soviet union. cnn as late as september of 2014 once acknowledged that the kiev government was bombing civilians .   

but not any more! all the non-russia-biased media have long since gotten the memo.

with just 13 days until election day, cnns dana bash asked trump why he is promoting his hotel instead of campaigning in swing states, i say the following you have been covering me for the last long time. i did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and ive been doing this for weeks straight. for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. and yet youll ask me that question. i think thats a very rude question, to be honest with you. 
trump cant defend why he is wasting precious time promoting his business interests instead of campaigning. trump doesnt have a single campaign event scheduled until 7 pm. he has given up a critical day of campaign time to get publicity for his new hotel. 
when trump got called out for some very unpresidential scheduling priorities, his response was to attack the reporter. 
the republican nominee is not behaving like a person who is willing to give everything to be elected the next president, and every time he leaves his fox news bubble, donald trump opens his mouth and reminds voters of why he should never be elected president.

"bombshell new details destroy republican hopes in fbi clinton email investigation share on twitter print this post 
the fbi is examining how a hillary clinton aide handled emails. the examination has nothing to do with the democratic nominee, her emails, or her email server. 
according to newsweeks kurt eichenwald, the scandal is related to the process clinton aide huma abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read. 
eichenwald reported because clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen, emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home, where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent. abedin, like many state department officials, found the government network technology to be cumbersome, and she had great trouble printing documents there, investigative records show. as a result, she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified state department account to either her yahoo account or her account on clintons server, and printed the emails from there. it is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husbands campaign. 
abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed clinton needed to see and when the secretary forwarded emails to her for printing. abedin told the fbi she would often print these emails without reading them. abedin printed a large number of emails this way, in part because, investigative records show, other staff members considered her clintons gatekeeper and often sent abedin electronic communications they wanted the secretary to see. 
the entire scandal is about how emails were printed. it has nothing to do with how hillary clinton handled emails or classified information. the investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for hillary clinton to read. no wonder comey didnt provide more details in his letter to congress. the details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the fbi. 
there is no evidence that clintons aide committed a crime. for the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal, there must be evidence that abedin intended to leak classified information. there remains zero evidence of criminal activity. 
the fbi examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the 2016 election , and comeys behavior is a disgrace to the us intelligence community. 
the new information destroys republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat . republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails, but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat. 
the emails wont change anything in 2016, but they will give congressional republicans a reason to keep investigating hillary clinton in 2017 and beyond. in other words, james comey is already delegitimizing hillary clintons potential presidency.",133,736266,real

"be careful what you wish for in the cesspool of manufactured darkness by smoking mirrors on october 29, 2016 smoking mirrors  oct 29, 2016 dog poet transmitting. chances are better than not that trump might win this election. of course, with the soros voting machines and the collective hatred of the privileged toward those being ground to dust beneath their hobnailed boots, its a no brainer that the election will be hijacked no matter what. the biggest enemy of humanities liberation from the cesspools of manufactured darkness has been human ignorance. for whatever the reason, in this apocalypse, people are waking up and becoming angry. they are seeing clinton for the international mass murderer and criminal that she is. it turns out to be less a vote for trump than it is a vote against hillary. the key evidence to support this particular argument is that few people are showing up for hillary rallies and speeches and large crowds are attending trumps. the degree of anti-trump bias in the media is beyond anything previously seen and the polls, as we know, are bullshit. i havent spoken to a single person here, on our aborted trip, or anywhere that was not for trump and i have spoken to a lot of people. its pretty good crowd sampling as it covers several states and pedestrian locations in those states. an associate of mine named bill juhas tells me that as he sees it, obama plans on pardoning hillary for all of her crimes and in return, hillary will appoint him to the supreme court. that makes a strange kind of sense. i do not doubt the possibility of anything these fiends might attempt to throw at us. what obama has done to american culture is about as obscene as it gets. he should be locked in a very small gender neutral bathroom with a bipolar tranny for all eternity. my only hesitation in passing this on to the authorities who control these placement duties is that he might like it. our trip was aborted because the psychic and ethereal, material ethers were vibrating with a type of manic panic, the like of which i have not previously encountered. turning around and heading back the way we came had an immediate salutary effect on all of our senses of well being and the potential lack thereof. your friendly author has not always exercised the common sense and native judgment that was available to him. were trying transform that tendency into something useful out of the shards of former stupidities. there have been a few dustups in these environs of late and some amount of crazy email spamming as well these are not connected. we didnt bother to read the emails and we tried to exercise detachment in respect of the former. now we will turn to the point of this exercise which is only tangentially associated with the garbage time antics of a handful of dysfunctional psychopaths, or what they may be planning to do to screw things up for the rest of us; not the least of which is to generate an economic disaster of godzilla like proportions, to render us terrified and malleable. economic disasters do not come about on their own. they are manufactured by satanists and as we have said here on more than one occasion, one does not have to be an initiated satanist to be a satanist. anyone who behaves like one is one. what we would like to talk about, here, in the waning moments of same old same old, is a most subjective thing. it has to do with my own intuition. it has to do with what i am feeling, as i scan what i am able to see of the world around me; close at hand and at a further remove. it has to do with the way information feeds into my consciousness and then reassembles itself into projections for the future. as we know, there really is no such thing as the future but for the sake of argument i feel no apprehension whatsoever. i feel as if it is all in the process of working itself out in a most wonderful and serendipitous way. this does not mean that millions will not die, due to this possible schematic or that possible schematic. we live in a collected universe in which we are all a universe unto ourselves and the possibilities of what might and might not happen are endless, as is the pointlessness of speculation. we live in a time of experts who cant find their ass with both hands. let us consider that hundreds of millions, billions will die whether anything happens or not because that is the nature of mortal terms of being. that is the nature of each of our individual leases on life. a catastrophe can sweep the planet. a ruinous war can escalate to the point of no return, by which few or none return from it. anything might and might not happen in this unpredictable world but what i do know is that it is all under control and in the hands of the most far seeing and benevolent power; the most absolute and unassailable power that there is or ever was. i had been told this a long time ago; a long time ago in relative terms and a tiny blip of time otherwise. i heard it but i did not hear it because i did not understand it but now i do. i have come to understand the meaning of it. the experience of comfort that i take from this is immense. everything is under control!!! surely we all remember the scripture that says; are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your fathers consent. nothing takes place here that is not permitted or engineered by the master of all things. it is a peculiar disconnect in this life that we can hear and not hear. we can understand the intellectual meaning of a statement but the force of it escapes our awareness. of course, an atheistic would dismiss the validity of this. they believe that there is nothing beyond our presence here and once we are gone we are gone forever. they believe that life is an accident of some form of evolution of consciousness and form. there is not a great deal that i know but i know that this is not true. i have direct experience otherwise and that has occurred more times than i can remember. i know that god is real. my perception of god is most certainly flawed but the existence of god is beyond any doubt in my heart and in my mind. i feel a terrible sense of loss when i consider the fate of an atheist, as i do when i think of all the wasted lives that pass like drunken marionettes before my eyes. i am powerless to effect a change in their destinies since in the majority of cases our paths will never cross. you and i and anyone can only affect those that fortune has put in our way. usually we influence others through the operation of our desires and appetites, or through the various traumas that we visit on one another. occasionally we might inspire another, if we ourselves are inspired and therein lies the heart of the matter. it is up to us who and what we seek out for inspiration. if we are dedicated and determined we will attract the attention of an angel of light, who is employed by the origin of light and we will be influenced by that light and we will transmit that light into the lives of others. i can think of no greater and more meaningful employment of our energies in this life. nothing else seems to contain anything of value. it is just the rotating wheel of endless futility. it is the dance of sisyphus. i look at all the alternatives in life and these options fill me with horror. to me, hell is a consciousness devoid of the almighty. hell is the absence of god. i do not intend to define what god is. that is beyond the capacity of any human mind and it is the source of never ending contention as well as immeasurable cruelties that take place each day because so many of us have made presumptions upon the nature of the ineffable. it is not our job to delineate the composition of the divine. it is our job to host the divine and the result of that hosting is that we are filled with the spirit and presence of the divine and thereby the divine is inclined to express through us to the degree that we permit this to occur. the divine is present, after a fashion in every one of us because we could not be alive otherwise but we preempt this with the shadow of the false self and it is thicker or thinner depending on the individual involved and what they get up to. this shadow is made denser and less dense according to the manner in which it is employed. some activities are dark indeed. i believe that nothing positive is served by worry and fear. fear displaces love and without love one has no guidance and no protection. love not only casts out fear but it arrests the potential of all of the events that fear exists in the apprehension of. we each have some understanding of the meaning of love but the meaning of love it far too deep for us to comprehend more than a fragment. if love is housed in our being and allowed to guide and direct us, it will drive everything that is not love far away from it. you will walk and live and breathe in confidence and every moment you will come closer to love and love will come closer to you. let us turn our minds away from every specter that this world generates in order to confound and distress us. focus on the great and unassailable power of the ineffable and let the rest of it go its way according to the people and situations it applies to. these other phantasms are of no concern to us, unless we make them so. end transmission.",197,736266,fake
"donald trump calls a black supporter a paid thug and kicks him out of his rally by sarah jones on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 834 pm we have a protester! by the way, were you paid 15,000 to be a thug? republican nominee donald trump yelled at a black man as he kicked him out. the man is was a supporter of trump's. share on twitter print this post 
we have a protester! by the way, were you paid 15,000 to be a thug? republican nominee donald trump yelled at a black man from his lectern during a rally wednesday evening in kinston, north carolina. 
trump went on suggesting that the man had been paid by hillary clinton to protest trump. but it turns out, as usual, trumps paranoia got the best of him and he kicked out his own supporter, a man named c.j. cary who happened to be wearing a gop badge and holding a letter supporting trump but urging him to stop being so offensive. 
watch here via raleighs news  observer 
the news and observer reported, cary says he wanted to deliver a note to trump urging him to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups black people, women, people with disabilities and college students. cary, an african-american, says hes an ex-marine who also worked in afghanistan as a civilian for the u.s. army. 
the irony is no doubt lost on the trump crowd that this man came to urge trump to be more inclusive of african americans and he got called a paid thug and kicked out. so the answer to his plea seems to be, never gonna happen. 
cary was wearing a gop badge and his letter slammed hillary clinton and president obama.

"judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary 'unelected and unaccountable' ... rule on 'their empathetic feelings' published 4 mins ago about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in 2006 after nearly three decades with the associated press, as well as several upper midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. print 
a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law. 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable, wrote justice tom parker this week. federal judges, as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v. hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to same-sex marriage, are unaccountable and unelected. 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting u.s. supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected. chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were, consequently, unaccountable. 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning, history, tradition, the courts own rules, or the rule of law, but upon their empathetic feelings.' 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges, he said. 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore, who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriage-based case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case, which created same-sex marriage nationwide, was announced. 
moore, who is challenging the punishment, insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves. they did, with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments. 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel, because retired judges, too, are unelected and unaccountable. 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda, instead of faithfully applying the rule of law, parker warned. obergefell is not the first case concerning same-sex marriage to prove this principle true. before the united states supreme court decided obergefell, the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states. 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book, now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family? 
before obergefell, 40 states passed laws affirming traditional marriage. in 37 of those states, the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional. of the 37 state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts, 24 of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional. each of the 24 courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable. 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account, citing the situation that developed in iowa. 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional. the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa. however, although the judges are initially appointed, they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires. 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted one-man-one-woman marriage as law, in april 2009, in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism, the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional. 
the very next year, three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election; all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa. this was the first time since iowa adopted its retention-election system that any judge had ever failed to be retained. the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law. 
mathew staver, chairman of of liberty counsel, which is representing moore, said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case. 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law. he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law, he said. 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable. at every turn, this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama. never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired. we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution. the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the 9-0 vote. never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule 16 has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term. a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a four-page order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life. this is not right. 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart, who has been acting as alabamas chief justice. 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore. 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization. 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics, fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary, they will no doubt take our complaint seriously, as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore, said tom ford, a spokesman for the group. 
the complaints, the group said, outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety, failed to perform the duties of her office impartially, failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary. 
daniel horowitz , senior editor at conservative review, told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation. 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues, whether its the bureaucrats, whether its the courts, and as it relates to even religious liberty, even property rights, immigration, our voting rights, who gets to vote, he said. 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america. 
how did we get here? horowitz asked rhetorically. and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this. this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges, the legal profession, and unelected bureaucrats. that is social transformation without representation, which, as scalia warned, is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution. 
same-sex marriage was mandated for the nation in 2015 by the bare 5-4 majority made up of anthony kennedy, ruth ginsburg, stephen breyer, sonia sotomayor and elena kagan. john roberts, clarence thomas, samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it. 
the majority found in the constitution a right to same-sex marriage, overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states. 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the u.s. supreme court majority. 
for one, two of the justices in the majority, kagan and ginsburg, were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for same-sex marriage, apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality. without their votes, the case would have gone the other way. 
they refused. 
then there was the u.s. supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier, in the defense of marriage act case, in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage. 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people. 
as wnd reported , ginsburg, who voted in favor of same-sex marriage, has performed same-sex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements. justice elena kagan also has performed same-sex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm. 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case, but they refused to acknowledge the request. the foundation explained that canon 3a6 of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court. 28 u.s.c. sec 455a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. 
rabbi jonathan cahn, author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah 910 judgment movie, has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage. 
at a prayer event in washington, he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage. that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation. 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained. 
justices, can you judge the ways of god? there is another court and there is another judge, where all men and all judges will give account, he warned. 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty, should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation? we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal, he said. 
see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol. 
the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling same-sex marriage an intrinsic evil. 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court. 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee, boston college, kansas state, notre dame, university of texas, villanova, vanderbilt, hillsdale, university of nebraska, catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of same-sex marriage as anti-constitutional and illegitimate. 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states, said the statement from the american principles project . 
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case. to recognize the authority of states to define marriage, and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions. to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons. to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell.",238,736264,real

the 12th woman has come forward to accuse donald trump of doing what he bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape. 
in a story that sounds very familiar, former miss finland ninni laaksonen told the tabloid ilta-sanomat that the now republican nominee grabbed her butt just before trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the late show with david letterman in 2006. 
before the show we were photographed outside the building, laaksonen is quoted by haaretz . trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. he really grabbed my butt. i dont think anybody saw it but i flinched and thought, what is happening?' 
as to the veracity of these claims, it should be noted that laaksonen didnt seek the tabloid out. ilta-sanomat, the second largest paper in the country according to wikipedia , reached out to finnish women who had encountered trump and thats how they discovered her story. 
in case youre not already grimacing, the former miss finland added, somebody told me there that trump liked me because i looked like melania when she was younger. 
trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of 35. melania trump is now 46, so she would have been expired when this alleged groping incident took place in 2006. 
new york magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against donald trump. 
donald trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their pssy against their will, so its not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the trump machine. 
what should be alarming is that donald trump is the best of the best on the republican bench. i mean, that is supposed to be how this works, right? a group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it. 
republicans try to say this is just locker room talk, but if then senator barack obama had had a bus tape like trumps, let alone 12 women accusing him of doing what he bragged about doing, he not only wouldnt be in office right now  he wouldnt have been a contender. rightfully so.",133,736264,real
"trump is deadbeating on his campaign debts by refusing to pay his own pollster the washington post reported donald trumps hiring of pollster tony fabrizio in may was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation. 
but the republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran gop strategist, who has advised candidates from 1996 gop nominee bob dole to florida gov. rick scott. the trump campaigns latest federal election commission report shows that it is disputing nearly 767,000 that fabrizios firm says it is still owed for polling. 
trumps decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given trumps history of not paying for services performed; it wont be the last. it is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain. 
donald trumps mentality has always been to put himself first. paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for trump. his businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades, so it isnt surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign. 
anybody who works for the trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because donald trumps version of making america great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket.

"comment on what does success mean to you? by 11 things to let go of before the new year share on facebook share on twitter this is something i have always had a bit of a hard time with growing up. seeing what success means to the world and how it has been defined as having money, a good job, working hard, sacrificing etc. sure this may only be the western world, but thats where i grew up so thats what i was exposed to. if i grew up somewhere else maybe it would have been different. im sure people dont even think of the word success or put any particular meaning to it in some places. advertisement - learn more it wasnt until i really began to see through the whole idea of success as i got into my later teens that i realized we are all chasing a common dream. something that has been defined for us. its not even something we feel passionate about inside or that we absolutely love doing that will lead us to success. its simply that we are chasing an idea of what success is. i saw this picture recently and it made me laugh. mainly because its soo true. have a look below.here you got this one unsuccessful guy on the bottom, whos just having a nice stroll, crisp smile going on, real nice strut and then you got this successful guy above whos sitting in traffic yelling on his cell phone or to the driver in front of him. the truth is, when we see these two scenarios we often think that someone who just strolls through life, takes it slow, doesnt go hard at chasing money is not as successful as someone who is wearing a suit, has nice things, is working to get to the top of their company and who may be rich. you literally hear this stuff all the time. its all just an illusion of success. but ask yourself the questions does it really feel resonant inside to chase money? to do what you dont want to be doing simply to be considered successful? to have to sacrifice and slave for more toys? how about being in competition with everyone so you can get ahead? wouldnt you rather live in and experience a world where you could just do what it is you felt inspired to do the most? and then be able to change at any point the moment you wish to experience something new? the truth is, success is literally everything we are doing. no matter what situation you are in, what circumstance you are experiencing, you were successful at creating that. we dont need to judge any experience as being more successful than the other because we are here to experience! we are here to have a variety of dynamic experiences that give us different circumstances and we are choosing all of them. advertisement - learn more we are all successful, plain a simple. and its not even that we need to be or need to focus on success. its simply that we dont need to chase it or define ourselves by it. we simply do what we feel inspired to do and all we need will come from choosing to experience in that manner. much love

"los brics plantan cara a la guerra financiera de estados unidos, por ariel noyola rodríguez los brics plantan cara a la guerra financiera de estados unidos por ariel noyola rodríguez para hacer frente a la guerra financiera de estados unidos, es urgente que los brics fortalezcan sus vínculos de cooperación en los ámbitos de la economía y las finanzas. el nuevo banco de desarrollo de los brics debe aumentar su volumen de créditos, lo mismo el acuerdo contingente de reservas. adicionalmente, los brics deben poner en marcha lo más pronto posible su propia agencia de calificación. para intensificar su cohesión económica, la implementación de un área de libre comercio echaría abajo las barreras arancelarias y, con ello, incrementaría sustancialmente los intercambios comerciales entre ellos. en definitiva, si no se toman cuanto antes las medidas pertinentes, los brics corren el riesgo de naufragar durante el próximo huracán financiero.
red voltaire  ciudad de méxico méxico  27 de octubre de 2016 français русский italiano el 15 y 16 de octubre se llevó a cabo en el estado de goa india la octava cumbre de los brics, acrónimo de brasil, rusia, india, china y sudáfrica. hay que reconocer que el encuentro se desarrolló en medio de una situación profundamente crítica para la economía mundial. sin embargo, los brics pusieron de manifiesto, una vez más, su extraordinaria capacidad para transformar un mal momento en una oportunidad para profundizar los vínculos entre ellos desde una perspectiva estratégica.
después de que las economías de los brics gozaran de una época dorada, en los últimos años sus tasas de crecimiento han sufrido una drástica desaceleración. frente a esta difícil coyuntura, hoy más que nunca los brics necesitan echar mano de las instituciones financieras que presentaron ante el mundo hace un par de años en fortaleza brasil durante su sexta cumbre  1 .
en abril pasado, su nuevo banco de desarrollo realizó sus primeros préstamos  2  por más de 800 millones de dólares y para 2017 se calcula que los créditos otorgados podrían alcanzar los 2 500 millones de dólares  3 . asimismo, esta entidad financiera llevó a cabo en julio de este año una histórica emisión de bonos verdes green bonds en yuanes por un monto equivalente a 450 millones de dólares  4 . estos títulos financieros, a la vez que incrementan la influencia de la moneda china a escala mundial, sirven para el financiamiento de grandes proyectos de inversión.
por su parte, el acuerdo contingente de reservas cra, por sus siglas en inglés, dotado de 100 000 millones de dólares, ya está listo para otorgar sus primeras líneas de crédito con el objetivo de estabilizar las balanzas de pagos de los brics, según anunció el ministro de finanzas de la india, arun jaitley  5 . toda vez que la reserva federal fed de estados unidos amaga permanentemente con subir la tasa de interés de los fondos federales federal funds rate y, con ello, detonar una nueva turbulencia financiera mundial, urge que los brics incrementen cuanto antes los recursos monetarios de su fondo de estabilización pues, de lo contrario, corren el riesgo de padecer serios estragos por las apuestas especulativas de los grandes bancos de inversiones.
de forma simultánea, los brics necesitan abrir nuevos frentes de batalla que desafíen de modo abierto la hegemonía de estados unidos y el dólar en el sistema financiero mundial  6 , no solamente a través de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino, por ejemplo, a través de la acumulación de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales, más todavía luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi, en chino ingresó oficialmente el pasado 1º de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights, la canasta de divisas de élite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi a finales de la década de los 60  7 .
por añadidura, los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolíticos entre américa latina, asia, áfrica y el medio oriente. los bancos regionales de desarrollo, que están conformados en su mayoría por los países periféricos, bien pueden servir a este objetivo el banco asiático de inversiones en infraestructura aiib, por sus siglas en inglés, el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra américa e incluso el banco del sur que, finalmente, arrancará antes de que termine este año.
asimismo, se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificación propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene a través de fitch, moodys y standard  poors  8 
. estas tres agencias de calificación, más que realizar evaluaciones que se guíen por criterios de tipo técnico, actúan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carácter político; esto es, como auténticas máquinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana y, con ello, elevan dramáticamente los costos de financiamiento de países como grecia, rusia o venezuela.
la cohesión económica es otro de los grandes retos, si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los años recientes entre 2001 y 2015, el comercio entre los brics como proporción de sus intercambios totales se duplicó del 6 al 12  9 . china es, por mucho, la economía que está más integrada con los demás brics. en contraste, los vínculos entre países como la india y sudáfrica son marginales. lo mismo sucede entre brasil y rusia. por eso es muy pertinente la próxima implementación de un área de libre comercio entre los brics  10 . sin embargo, además de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos, los brics necesitan promover la construcción de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta; esto es, integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrialización de las economías menos aventajadas.
en conclusión, son muchos los desafíos en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes. estoy convencido de que, en lo sucesivo, el éxito de los brics dependerá de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse, de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperación con vistas a cumplir metas de más largo alcance. frente a la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos, es momento de que los brics vuelvan a la carga

"michael oliver  here is the big picture for gold after the takedown 11 views november 13, 2016 gold , kwn king world news 
on the heels of a remarkable week where the world witnessed the greatest political upset in history and subsequent chaos in global markets, today king world news is pleased to present an extremely important update on the war in the gold market from michael oliver at msa. oliver allowed kwn exclusively to share this key report with our global audience after last weeks takedown in the gold market. 
by michael oliver, msa momentum structural analysis november 13  king world new s  gold if one seeks to capture large trends, then measure large if one does not have a long-term map to watch as the trend unfolds, then its all too easy to run when some bullets fly. and they always fly continue reading the michael oliver piece below advertisement to hear which company investors  institutions around the globe are flocking to that has one of the best gold  silver purchase  storage platforms in the world click on the logo 
how we got to where we are today msa projected a blow-off type move in gold, commencing in september 2009, based on price and momentum concurrence and especially its relative performance breakouts vs. global stocks, report was entitled gold is speaking! momentum then broke out over a three point downtrend, noted by the first red line. 
during that rise a very large price selloff occurred in early 2010 that no doubt shook teeth and generated widespread doubt. big as the drop was, it did not negate any long-term structural factors on momentum. nothing reversed that bull view on our part until momentum broke down in early 2012 second red structure was violated  a line defined by many points along the line at around price of 1700 see middle of second chart above. 
then after the top in 20112012 and after momentum had already begun to cave, there came a hair curling rally in late summer 2012. but for annual momentum it was a laughable and uneventful rally. it did not alter the major downside that had already been signaled by momentum early that year. therefore msa was not impressed. many no doubt went long thinking the gold bull was on again. not! 
the gold bull market breakout then with momentum basing action that was optimally clear and massive, golds momentum broke out upside as price moved up into the mid-1100s in february 2016. the massive flat red line on momentum was blasted through see breakout on far right hand side of chart two above. 
msa remains resolutely bullish and asserts that a long-term annual momentum uptrend is underway . exit if you must, based on your own level of risk tolerance each investor and asset manager is different, after all, or if your time scale of participation is short-term. 
msa defines trends, often intermediate and short-term ones in many markets, but in the case of gold we argue that a long-term vista must dominate at this point in time, due to massive shifts underway in other asset categories. implications of those shifts going forward are quite large, such that gold is likely to be at the forefront of world attention in the coming few years . 
the dream of investors but remember that the long-held dream of investors to capture and profit from large trends like the three massive but simple trends shown on the prior page can never be accomplished if one allows short-term or even intermediate-term trend indicators to have more gravitas than the ongoing long-term trend factors . in some markets thats a reasonable approach, but at this point in time, with the annual trend dynamics underway, we caution about trading gold . 
this annual bull signal is simply too young, has not reached any levels of upside excess, and the downturn on long-term momentum charts in the current selloff is not negating that which was screamed by golds annual momentum breakout in february. kwn has just released one of art cashins greatest audio interviews ever discussing the gold market at length, including the recent takedown in gold, what to surprises to expect in key markets as trump becomes president, and what impact massive public works projects will have on the united states, inflation, gold, bonds, and much more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview by clicking here or on the image below.

"trump makes special announcement after homeless lady attacked by liberals share this after a homeless black trump supporter was brutally set upon by an intolerant liberal mob, donald trump made an incredible announcement. 
a homeless black woman who has been guarding donald trumps hollywood walk of fame star from vandals was recently set upon by ruthless liberals, ripping up her signs and assaulting the helpless woman. however, as soon as trump heard about what the leftist thugs had done, he immediately issued a special announcement that has us cheering. 
after privileged millionaire james otis obliterated the donalds sidewalk star on wednesday, an unnamed homeless woman boldly took it upon herself to act as guardian, making the cold slab her new temporary home. utilizing her sleeping spot as her own political platform, the courageous vagrant created signs to peacefully showcase her support for trump. unfortunately, she underestimated just how savage and intolerant liberals are, especially when it comes to the minorities they claim to champion expressing a different opinion. 
just one day after the homeless woman set up residence next to trumps star, a mob of vicious anti-trump thugs attacked her, rt reports. after pushing her around and stealing her signs, some of the only property she owns, the animals knocked her and her cart down, continuing to hurl sickening insults and snatch things. 
video captured the enraging assault, showing the woman lying on the ground, shaking, and holding back tears. fortunately, the heart-breaking story quickly made its way to trump, the only politician concerned with this transients well-being. now, the republican nominee has made an incredible announcement befitting of a u.s. president. 
the gateway pundit reports that trump was so appalled by the mobs treatment of this destitute woman that he has not only announced that he has a special gift for the victim but promises to seek justice for her barbaric abusers. the presidential candidates attorney, michael cohen, proclaimed on friday that trump promises the woman will have the last laugh on these thugs. . diamondandsilk realdonaldtrump someone please help me locate this woman as mr. trump has a gift for her 
 michael cohen michaelcohen212 october 28, 2016 
at trumps behest, cohen exploded on twitter, repeatedly requesting followers to find the homeless woman. he explained that they have checked, but she is no longer staying on trumps star. however, the candidate wants to change her life when he finds her. 
proving just how passionate trump is about helping the woman, cohen spent much of friday responding to tweets, hoping to find some clue as to the womans current whereabouts. one user asserted that the woman is marsha lee , a resident of santa monica. however, it is unclear if this information is accurate. 
cohen assured that the police are investigating the incident and he and trump will do everything possible to see that the thugs responsible for the assault are brought to justice. its truly heart-warming to see such a powerful man going out of his way to do something significant for someone considered the least of these. 
hopefully, this woman will receive the mystery gift trump has waiting for her and the savages who bullied an innocent homeless person will be punished for their cowardly behavior. of course, dont expect hillary clinton or barack obama to say that her black life matters or even apologize for the thuggery of their own supporters. in fact, neither of them has come forward to help the unfortunate victim of their national policies that never helped her off the streets in the first place. 
this stomach-churning incident just goes to show how tolerant the left is when it comes to blacks, or anyone else for that matter, simply having an opinion with which they disagree.",108,736267,fake
"friday fox follies  megyn  murdochs money by headly westerfield on fri, oct 28th, 2016 at 1020 pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof, rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her. share on twitter print this post 
earlier this week friday fox follies , under the assumption the explosive , and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich, would be this weeks lede , i had already tricked up an opening paragraph. in case you missed it , thats when he got personal , accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues . this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election. the nyt calls em megyn moments ; i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience. 
then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open. that paragraph, lovingly crafted, went out the window. but, lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings, as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly . watch 
as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof , rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her. her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract. million in contract talks with fox news 
if they are going to make a network that is going to be a post-ailespost-trump, it will be around megyn kelly, chris wallace and shep smith, and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard, said andrew tyndall, a television-news consultant, of other hosts at the network. that isnt going to happen, promised mr. murdoch. were not changing directionthat would be business suicide, he said. mr. oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year, and mr. murdoch said, were going to want bill to stay with us. mr. hannitys contract isnt up until 2020. ms. kelly has forged close ties to mr. murdochs sons, particularly lachlan murdoch, who is co-executive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks, people close to the situation said. 
fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released, both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well. 
from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that , by the daily beasts tim teeman  
imagine, then, her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise-ridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon vanity fair; megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work pajiba; and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now the stir. note the grudging headlines. because of kellys employer, and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional, left-wing context throughout her career to date, the f-word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl. this, in itself, reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a right-facing institution and not be 100 percent right wing yourself, or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for. full disclosure i worked for the times of london, a british, rupert murdoch-owned newspaper, for over 13 years. 
aside from the fact that when she tilts right, she tends to tilt alt-right, the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hard-edged. marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee, but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy . this makes her less attractive to other networks. shes hoping to change that impression when she co-hosts live with kelly ripa the kelly  kelly show? the morning after the election . think of her as a designated hitter, trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park. 
still watters still a few weeks back fff reported on a racist watters world in which the white privileged pencil-necked geek made fun of asians. this week asian american groups meet with fox news personnel over awful jesse watters segment  
paul cheung, president of aaja, told the erik wemple blog that the meeting was productive. i think they heard what the communitys reactions are, he said of the session at new yorks museum of chinese in america. approximately 130 asian american groups and allies have signed an open letter to fox news regarding the unfortunate episode, said cheung. ron kim, a new york state assemblyman in attendance, told this blog that a representative from the oreilly factor and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting. together they played a good cop, bad cop routine, said kim. the gentleman from oreillys show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of fox news and sometimes edgy humor can go too far, said kim. once again, the specter of fox newss vaunted news-opinion divide presents itself. as weve noted before, this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify fox news hosts such as sean hannity openly campaigning for donald trump, steve doocy of the morning show fox  friends spreading harmful innuendo into the public square  and oreilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about chinatown.",133,736266,real
"earths magnetic field is collapsing  are the poles about to switch? as it turns out  according to studies our planets magnetic field could flip in our lifetime. according to experts , the position of the south pole has shifted and is not located precisely at antarctica, the north pole is also believed to be racing across the arctic ocean. earths magnetic field appears to be collapsing which could severely damage our climate and wipe out power grids across the world. 
our planets magnetic field exists because earth has a massive ball of iron at its core which is surrounded by an outer layer of molten metal.
as the earths magnetic field varies over time, the positions of the north and south magnetic poles gradually change. the magnetic declination at a given location also changes over time. as it turns out a lot has changed in the last couple of hundred years, and to see what we are taking about visit noaa and take a look at historical magnetic declination .

interestingly, according to previous studies, earths magnetic field  which shields our planet from blasts of deadly solar radiation has dangerously weakened in the last couple of years.
according to reports from the european space agency , the biggest weak spots seen in the magnetic field are located in the western hemisphere.
experts are unsure why the magnetic field is weakening but one of the most likely reasons is that our planets magnetic poles are getting ready to flip said rune floberghagen, the esas swarm mission manager.
researchers have concluded that the magnetic field had diminished at a rate of around five percent per century. however, new studies who that the magnetic field is weakening at an accelerated rate of five percent per decade meaning that it is deteriorating five times faster than previously believed.
if we take a look at the animation of secular variation in geomagnetic total intensity for the last 400 years, we will see that the magnetic field began weakening in 1600 .
animation of secular variation in geomagnetic total intensity for the last 400 years 
furthermore, the magnetic field weakened a staggering 10 percent from the 1800s to 2000.
ok so what would happen if it really flips? according to experts, if the pole switch does happen the entire planet and everything on it will become exposed to solar winds which could punch giant holes into the ozone layer which in turn could have a devastating effect on mankind. if the planets magnetosphere starts collapsing power grids could collapse, the weather would abruptly change and humans would have serious health risks.
according to reports from the european space agency, as of 2014 the magnetic field is continuing to weaken rapidly . with the help of swarm, scientists have obtained unprecedented insights into the complex workings of earths magnetic field. reports show that the general trend of the magnetic field is weakening and the most dramatic declines are present over the western hemisphere.

the latest measurements also confirm the movement of magnetic north towards siberia. it is believed that the magnetic field is speeding away at a rate of about 40 miles per year.
but what is most terrifying is perhaps a study that warns that magnetic reversals lead to extinction events. the highlights of the study indicate 
geomagnetic field reversal substantially weakens the protection for the atmosphere. solar wind energizes more oxygen ions to escape when geomagnetic field is weakened. oxygen escape may explain the drop of atmospheric level during mass extinction. the causal relation between reversal and mass extinction should be many-to-one. the simulated oxygen escape rate based on knowledge of mars support our hypothesis. furthermore, it is believed that magnetic reversals can be responsible for floods of biblical proportions as you can see in the video below

"supreme court decides to weigh in on transgender rights by adalia woodbury on sun, oct 30th, 2016 at 1131 pm on friday, the supreme court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of gloucester county school board vs. g.g. this gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they dont like. plain and simple. share on twitter print this post 
on friday, the supreme court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of gloucester county school board vs. g.g . this gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they dont like. plain and simple. 
at issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with. 
last summer, the court granted the school boards request to put a lower court ruling in the students favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the supreme court. justice breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy. 
the virginia school board established a policy mirroring bathroom police laws in red states like north carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth. 
in this case, the district court ruled against g.g. by relying on a 1975 regulation allowing schools to provide separate toilet, locker room and shower facilities based on sex provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex. 
in january 2015, the department of educations office of civil rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a school must treat transgender students in a manner consistent with their gender identity. 
because of that letter, the u.s. court of appeals for the 4th circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of g.g. it relied on a 1997 supreme court decision that courts generally should defer to an agencys interpretation of its own regulation. 
in reality, the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case. first, this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender, which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women, poc and members of the lgbt community. second, the right wing is hoping to weaken federal agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations.",133,736268,real
"who is peter kadzik? the clinton ally and john podesta's very close friend peter kadzik who will take charge of doj's hillary clinton and huma abedin email probe source 70news 

october 31, 2016 updated on november 1, 2016 

 john podesta kadzik was a ""fantastic lawyer"" who ""kept me out of jail."" 

 podesta and kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. 

 both were classmates at georgetown law school in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate podesta's birthday. and in another sent last may, kadzik's son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign. 

 kadzik lobbied podesta  then wh chief of staff  to pardon his billionaire, tax dodger fugitive client marc rich, whose wife gave 1 million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon. fbi director james comey is now trying to do the right thing and correct the deed cleaning up the mud he and hillary clinton put all over the face of fbi agency. by reopening hillary clinton's case, thanks to 650k-emails linked to sex scandal of huma abedin's husband anthony weiner and the mutiny of fbi agents who won't put up with comey's crap, we are suppose to finally get justice. 

but guess what? doj assigned a clinton ally and john podesta's very close friend peter kadzik to take charge of the new investigation. 

in a letter to congress, the doj writes that it ""will continue to work closely with the fbi and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,"" assistant attorney general peter j. kadzik writes in letters to house and senate lawmakers. 

who is peter kadzik? 

according to an excellent article published by daily caller 

the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october, john podesta, the democrat's campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including peter kadzik, a top official at the justice department. 

the dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state's email practices. 


podesta and kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. in one email from january, kadzik and podesta, who were classmates at georgetown law school in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate podesta's birthday. and in another sent last may, kadzik's son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign. 

the post-benghazi dinner was attended by podesta, kadzik, superlobbyist vincent roberti and other well-placed beltway fixtures. 

kadzik, who started at the doj in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 

in the trenches 

podesta and kadzik have a long history  one which has largely gone unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal. 

kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation. and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration, kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich, the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 

that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account. 

in a sept. 2008 email , which the washington free beacon flagged last week, podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. 

podesta, who would later head up the obama white house transition effort, wrote that kadzik was a ""fantastic lawyer"" who ""kept me out of jail."" 

podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 

kadzik was then representing marc rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the u.s. government for evading a 48 million tax bill. the fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. 

to help rich, kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan. 20, 2001. 

a house oversight committee report released in may 2002 stated that ""kadzik was recruited into marc rich's lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of white house chief of staff john podesta."" 

the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon. 

on top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, rich's ex-wife, denise rich, had doled out more than 1 million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon. she gave 100,000 to hillary clinton's new york senate campaign and another 450,000 to the clinton presidential library.

"the year 2016 set to be hottest on record       information the year 2016 set to be hottest on record by afp november 14, "" afp "" - the year 2016 will ""very likely"" be the hottest on record, the un said monday, warning of calamitous consequences if the march of global warming cannot be halted.
average temperatures for the year were set to hit about 1.2 celsius 2.16 degrees fahrenheit over pre-industrial revolution levels  meaning that 16 of the 17 hottest years on record were this century, said the un's world meteorological organization wmo .
the new record means the world is already more than halfway to the upper limit of 2 c of warming overall, 1.5 c if possible, which un nations had agreed upon to stave off worst-case-scenario climate change .
""another year. another record. the high temperatures we saw in 2015 are set to be beaten in 2016,"" wmo secretary general petteri taalas said in a statement.

 wmo  omm wmo november 14, 2016
the el nino weather phenomenon had boosted temperatures in the early months of the year, but even after its effects dissipated, the mercury stayed high.
in parts of arctic russia, temperatures were 6 c to 7 c higher than the long-term average, the statement said. other arctic and sub-arctic regions in russia, alaska and northwest canada were at least 3 c above average.
""we are used to measuring temperature records in fractions of a degree, and so this is different,"" said taalas.
the wmo report was published as un climate talks entered their second week in marrakesh  the first since last year's huddle in the french capital concluded with the climate-rescue paris agreement.
the moroccan followup is meant to agree on rules for executing the plans and goals outlined in the pact, which envisions reining in global warming by cutting back on greenhouse-gas emitting coal, oil and gas for energy.
high impact events
earlier monday, the annual global carbon budget report said carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels have been nearly flat for three years in a row  a ""great help"" but not enough to stave off dangerous climate change.
both analyses warned that concentrations of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continued to rise, reaching 400 parts per million in 2015 and likely to exceed that record in 2016.
global temperatures for january to september this year were about 1.2 c over pre-industrial levels, and 0.88 c over the average for 1961-1990, said the wmo.
""more than 90 percent of northern hemisphere land areas outside the tropics were at least 1 c above average.""
temperatures were also above normal over most ocean areas, contributing to coral bleaching and disrupted marine ecosystems in tropical waters, the report said.
arctic sea ice extent was ""well below normal"" throughout the year.
""because of climate change, the occurrence and impact of extreme events has risen,"" the wmo said. heatwaves and flooding that once occurred once in a generation, are now much more regular.
it pointed to several ""high impact"" events this year, including hurricane matthew which ravaged haiti in october, flooding in china, several heatwaves, the most damaging wildfire in canadian history and major droughts.
food shortages, population migration and conflict are expected to increase as a result of more frequent and potentially more intense weather-related disasters, the report warned.

"trump dedicates d.c. hotel 'the future lies with the dreamers' republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president.
coming off of campaign events in florida tuesday and before he jetted off to north carolina to resume his quest for the white house, trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the trump international hotel washington, d.c., built in the citys historic old post office building.
under budget and ahead of schedule. so important. we dont hear those words so often, but you will, said trump , linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president. today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country.
 
related stories trump sets gop fundraising milestone in small-donor contributions newt gingrich defends donald trump against sexual predator accusations donald trumps star on hollywood walk of fame vandalized trump also spoke as a developer, not just as a candidate.
my job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be, he said. these are spaces that have no hope, no future. but you need imagination and you need the ability to get them done and to unlock their potential, and to unlock the potential of the people working on those spaces and on those projects, and we have so many things we can do for our country.
the united states is great, he said. its great. its people are great. there is no task or project too great. there is no dream outside of our reach. dont ever let anyone tell you it cant be done. the future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.
 
the fact that trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction.

republican strategist steve schmidt , who helped sen. john mccain, r-ariz., in his 2008 white house race, was among those who said trumps priorities were skewed.
the walls are collapsing, schmidt said, referring to polls showing trump behind. trump has discounted those polls as inaccurate and pointed to others that show him leading.

trump campaign manager kellyanne conway suggested that a dose of perspective might be useful.
hes making a pit stop here in washington and his under-budget, ahead-of-schedule hotel is really remarkable. it shows americans the tangible accomplishments of donald trump. hes somebody who builds things. hes somebody who fixes things, she said wednesday on nbcs today show.
and you know, respectfully, hillary clinton has time to go to an adele concert and everybody thinks thats really cool. donald trump stops off to unveil just an incredible, stunning piece of architecture, new hotel, first-class hotel, and everybodys hair is on fire, she said.
conway dared anyone to find a candidate with a more active schedule than trump.
hillary clinton took five days off to prepare for one debate and everybody looked at that as some kind of noble exercise with 23 days to go. nobody covered that as, where is she? why doesnt she campaign much? what is she doing? where is she hiding? conway said. hes got the most active campaign schedule of the two candidates by far.

"nbc reports u.s. prepping possible false-flag cyber-attack election day eric zuesse the reliability of all of these reports can reasonably be questioned, but here they are on october 14th, nbc news bannered cia prepping for possible cyber strike against russia , and reported that, the obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia in retaliation for alleged russian interference in the american presidential election, u.s. intelligence officials told nbc news.  the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the cia was considering, but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors, selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation. on october 30th, super station 95 reported an update saying that a trusted source said it appears the united states is going to engage in battle in syria. superstation95 just received this communication from a trusted source i just landed back in the us from diego garcia. war is brewing. the island has more aircraft and refueling tankers than i have seen since 2005. docks were full and 30 ships were moored off shore.this is a huge buildup. b1s and b2s and b52s in abundance. never seen them all at one place. it seems stupid to bunch them up at one facility. our layover was only supposed to be for 4 hours but the flight crews were so backed up we stayed overnight. the hotel was full and we bunked in a tent. we have never had to do that before. af security is everywhere and they were assey. acting like strict, suspicious assholes just a heads up, keep your eyes open. i know that i am not giving away in classified information, the russians have a satellite dedicated to watching this island. also, the navy had 2 subs at the docks at once. i have never seen more than 1 there. b52s have new paint jobs  all flat black. whats up with that? on top of all this, huge numbers of in-flight refueling tankers are also on the island. more than enough to supply air operations tofrom the middle east, non-stop. this is a very bad development. the us would never stage this much hardware at diego garcia unless they were planning a full-out, prolonged, military action. based upon my military experience as a contractor who has visited diego garcia every 6 months for 11 years, we are going to war. on november 3rd, nbc news headlined exclusive white house readies to fight election day cyber mayhem , and reported officials are alert for any attempts to create election day chaos, and say steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet. but what is more likely, multiple u.s. officials say, is a lower-level effort by hackers from russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating twitter, facebook and other social media platforms. this news-report included a video of andrea mitchell, headlined is russia a third party in the 2016 race? if the united states government, on or after election day, says that russia had done something of this nature, then the u.s. response to the alleged cyber-attack from russia would presumably be one or more of the exact measures the cia was considering, as nbc reported on october 14th, and world war iii could then start with a cyber-war that could escalate to serious consequences, such as deactivating a power-grid in one or both of the countries, and, subsequently, a direct military invasion, of one by the other. but how would the u.s. public ever be able to come to know whether that alleged russian provocation actually existed and wasnt instead provoked intentionally by the u.s. government in order to provide a pretext for the u.s. to invade russia? after all, weve been pouring troops and weapons onto and near russias borders for months now  and how would the u.s. respond to a provocation in which russia surrounded our border with nukes? on november 2nd, jeremiah johnson an anonymous retired green beret, headlined something big is underway on all fronts within the next few weeks the future of the united states will be decided, and he reported that as of this writing, the increased u.s. troop presence in eastern europe includes a battalion-sized element of american troops being emplaced in the suwalki gap, polish territory that borders lithuania in a 60-mile stretch of corridor. the russian defense ministry announced that 600 russian and belarussian airborne troops conducted training exercises in brest, on the belorussian-polish border only a few miles from where the u.s. forces are deploying in poland. this on the heels of britain deploying 800 men, tanks, and jets to estonia, along with pledges of challenger 2 tanks, apcs armored personnel carriers, and drones. two companies of french and danish soldiers will join the british in the deployment to estonia. for the first time since 1945, norway has violated its treaty with russia then the soviet union not to station foreign troops on its soil. a company of u.s. marines will soon be stationed for a 6-month deployment in norway. the situation is heating up in ukraine, according to a report on fort-russ.com entitled ukraine moves massive force up to lugansk frontline , published october 28, 2016. the report reveals the ukrainian army is deploying 3,500 soldiers and 200 armored vehicles of the 15th motorized infantry brigade to krasny oktyabr in the district of lugansk in eastern ukraine. for the first time in history, romanian airspace is being patrolled by the raf royal air force of britain. his report closes the next war will be initiated by an emp electro-magnetic pulse device detonated above the continental united states followed by a limited nuclear exchange and then conventional warfare.  obama is the joker, setting the stage for the transfer of power. that transfer is not going to occur with the losing candidate in either case going gently into that good night. the stage is set for a war to begin. the stage is set for a false flag operation to take down our grid. the stage is set to steal the election for clinton or declare it null and void. within the next few weeks, the future of the united states will be decidedwith or without the consent of the governed. if its not true, then why is the u.s. engaging in these preparations? russia has never attacked america. the cold war was supposed to have ended. the u.s. government obviously thinks it now is actually hotter than ever, and so, apparently, we place the jihadists on the back burner; weve got a much bigger war to wage, and well know soon whether it starts soon after the election.",230,736275,fake

"stung by clinton allegations, trump claims he used no undocumented workers in dc hotel by hrafnkell haraldsson on thu, oct 27th, 2016 at 756 am trump used undocumented labor to build trump tower and workers told the washington post in 2015 they were working on his hotel illegally   
so donald trump has responded to hillary clintons accusation that he used undocumented workers to build his new d.c. hotel, a 263-room luxury hotel just blocks from the white house. trump claims he used no undocumented workers  and as we saw earlier , oh yeah, hillary clinton sleeps three days at a time. 
trumps decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows, not just in the clinton camp. republican strategist steve schmidt told msnbc, 
he is not doing any of the normal activities that youd be doing 13 days out in a presidential race for somebody whos competitive. you dont take a time-out to tend to your business interests. 
as libby nelson wrote at vox , clinton is making her closing argument. trump is making infomercials. 
all this seems to have stung the thin-skinned trump, who previously set aside his campaign to open a golf course in scotland. as cbs news sopan deb tweets , trumps defense was a little odd, to say the least trump's riff on his hotel is worth your time to read. denies ever using undocumented immigrants and says clinton sleeps for 3 days at a time pic.twitter.comrlsbebzk2y 
 sopan deb sopandeb october 27, 2016 
the republican nominee protested to cnns dana bash , for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop, and then she goes home and sleeps. it is literally impossible for trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else. 
trumps defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism he works all the time while clinton sleeps for three days. he says he took an hour off it was a bit more than that to open his new hotel while she wants to sleep all the time. 
he says clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days. in fact, clinton made two get out the vote stops in florida yesterday; she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in north carolina and has two appearances scheduled in iowa for the day after. 
and trumps heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing, considering his track record in that regard. 
it is a fact, as hillary clinton said yesterday, that donald trump once again used undocumented labor to build a hotel. he used undocumented labor to build trump tower . and the washington post reports that trumps new downtown d.c. hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included hispanic construction workers, including some workers who say they are undocumented . said one worker in 2015, the majority of us are hispanics, many who came illegally. 
the old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind, in reading trumps denial. this is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves, this remains true. 
nonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection, and it wont work. trump already has his clothing lines made in china, mexico, and elsewhere, and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of american jobs. 
trump is a hypocrite, and hissy fits and deflection are no answer to the allegations against him, and certainly no recommendation for the office of president.",133,736264,real

"the fbi intervenes in the 2016 election license dmca 
in an extraordinary and unprecedented action, the federal bureau of investigation has stepped into the 2016 presidential campaign only 11 days before election day, sending a letter to congress announcing new ""investigative steps"" related to hillary clinton's use of a private email server. 
the three-paragraph letter by fbi director james comey to eight congressional committees on friday is remarkably vague. it states that ""in connection with an unrelated case, the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation"" of clinton's personal email server, which, comey notes, he had previously told congress was ""completed."" 
he states that he has agreed to ""allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."" he acknowledges that the fbi ""cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant."" 
the obvious question that arises is why, given the fact that the fbi has no idea whether these additional emails contain any significant information relative to the clinton email case, the agency should make them a public issue within days of the election. media commentators noted that the letter violates a longstanding informal fbi ban on making politically sensitive announcements within 60 days of a us election. 
following the report of comey's letter, the news media, citing unnamed federal law enforcement officials, said the emails in question were found on a laptop computer shared by clinton aide huma abedin and her husband, former representative anthony weiner. - advertisement - 
weiner is under fbi investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl. abedin announced her separation from weiner earlier this year after the latest episode involving weiner and sexually explicit internet activity became public. 
comey's letter was hailed by donald trump and republican party spokesmen as tantamount to an official reopening of the fbi investigation and rescinding of the decision announced by comey in july that no charges would be brought against the democratic presidential candidate. 
clinton spoke to the press briefly friday evening, demanding that the fbi provide more information about the substance of what it was reviewing, including whether there was any connection to her use of a private email server. she pointed out that more than 15 million people have already voted and that many millions more will be going to the polls over the next week as early voting continues. in response to questions, she indicated that the fbi has not contacted her and that she first learned of the letter through the media. 
it is at this point impossible to determine with precision the motivation behind comey's letter and the political forces for which he is speaking. however, his attempt to present the letter as a politically disinterested response to the discovery of new information lacks any credibility. 
this direct intervention into the election by the top police-intelligence agency can only be an expression of deep crisis and profound tensions within the american ruling class and the state. the election as a whole has been dominated by the growth of social anger and anti-establishment sentiment, yet it has ended in a contest between two right-wing representatives of the richest 1 percent who are despised by huge sections of the electorate. - advertisement - 
it has plumbed the depths of political debasement on the part of both candidates -- the fascistic billionaire trump seeking to channel discontent along the most right-wing, chauvinist and racist channels; the multimillionaire clinton relying on sex scandals and a mccarthyite attack on trump as an agent of russian president vladimir putin to bury incriminating revelations of corruption and lying and to swing public opinion behind a policy of military escalation and confrontation with nuclear-armed russia. 
the entire process has been surrounded by an aura of violence and a breakdown of public confidence in the political system. it has unfolded under conditions of deepening economic crisis, mounting international tensions and worsening crises for us imperialism around the world, i.e., the ongoing debacle of washington's war for regime change in syria, the signs of disarray in the anti-chinese ""pivot to asia,"" the emergence of open conflicts with imperialist ""allies"" in europe, particularly germany. 
the convergence of these crises is generating bitter conflicts within the american ruling class over policy questions, magnified by fears of a rising tide of social opposition at home. 
whether the intention of comey's letter was to inflict fatal damage to clinton's candidacy, shore up endangered republican majorities in the senate and house, or fire a shot across the bow against an incoming clinton administration, it makes clear that the next administration will be mired in crisis from the day it takes office.",127,736268,fake

while the media and americas culture will have you believe that black people or anyone who isnt white account for copious amounts of fraud, theres a story breaking that you wont hear on fox news anytime soon or you might, because any chance to crush the snap program, they will take. 
according to wcax news in new york 
more than 30 people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the north country. 
investigators say over the past couple months people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the old time butcher block store in brushton. 
police also say its not the first time the owner of that store, dennis sauve, has been charged with allowing such fraud. 
police say more arrests are expected. 
now heres the kicker theyre all white. brushton, new york, where this bust happened, has a population of roughly 480 people. approximately 99.83 of the population is white, and 0.42 are black. these demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country , owsley country, kentucky, which is 99.22 white and 95 republican. maybe we should investigate them. 
i just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in brushton. 
according to wptz news 
police say the arrests are the result of a year-long investigation, initiated by the franklin county department of social services fraud unit. franklin county district attorneys office, the united states department of agriculture, and the new york state office of temporary and disability assistance helped with the investigation. 
the store owner, denis sauve also white, has been charged with third-degree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps. 
this really isnt a racial issue so much as it is an, i told you so, issue. while the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program, a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the lazy blacks who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance. well, here we are, a major food stamp bust and every criminal involved is white.

"our landfill economy want to make a quick profit along a tropical sea coast? dig some big holes near the coast, dump in baby prawns, food and chemicals to suppress algae blooms and diseases and then harvest the prawns to ship to the insatiable markets of the developed world. 0 our landfill economy want to make a quick profit along a tropical sea coast? dig some big holes near the coast, dump in baby prawns, food and chemicals to suppress algae blooms and diseases and then harvest the prawns to ship to the insatiable markets of the developed world. by iwb  october 27, 2016 
by charles hugh-smith 
this maximizing growth and profits is the highest good mode of production is insane. 
correspondent bart d. australia captured the entire global economy in three words the landfill economy . stuff is manufactured, energy is consumed shipping it somewhere, consumers buy it and shortly thereafter it ends up as garbage in the landfill. 
this is of course the definition of economic growth waste, inefficiency, environmental destructionnone of these matter. only two things matter maximize growth by any means necessary, and maximize profits by any means necessary. 
the landfill economy now encompasses the entire planet. the swirling gyre of plastic trash the size of texas between hawaii and california its just one modest example of the planetary trash dump that growth and profit generate as byproductsblowback. 
the planets oceans are one giant trash dump. everything from plastic water bottles to abandoned fishing nets to radiation to containers that fell off ships is floating around even the most distant corners of the seas. seabirds nesting in remote islands die of starvation as their guts fill with plastic bits of permanent growth. 
globalization has turned the planets land masses and rivers into trash dumps. want to make a quick profit along a tropical sea coast? dig some big holes near the coast, dump in baby prawns, food and chemicals to suppress algae blooms and diseases and then harvest the prawns to ship to the insatiable markets of the developed world. 
once the prawn farms are poisoned wastelands, move on and despoil another coastline elsewhere. 
globalization has greased the slippery slope from factory to landfill by enabling the global distribution of defective parts. whether they are pirated, designed to fail or just the result of slipshod quality control, the flood of defective parts guarantee that the entire assembly they are installed instoves, vacuum cleaners, transmissions, electronics, you name itwill soon fail and be shipped directly to the landfill, as repairing stuff is far costlier than buying a new replacement. 
qezirp is crushing the global supply chain, product quality and profits october 17, 2016 
the keynesian cargo cults that rule global economics love the landfill economy because it means more growth. never mind the poisoned seas, rivers and land, or the immense waste of energy, commodities and labor that result from the global manufacture and distribution of shoddy products if it adds to growth, its all good in the warped view of the keynesian cargo cults. 
we got your growth right here. 
people are also tossed on the trash heap with careless abandon. the health of workers is a cost that reduces profits, so its ignored unless it can be turned into a profit center via state funding for managing preventable diseases, i.e. sickcare. 
a worker sickened by industrial waste or lifestyle illnesses who becomes a profit center is a wonderful source of growth and profits.

"lindsey graham wants trump to put ted cruz on the supreme court bench on november 11, 2016 330 pm  
as if the election of donald trump couldnt get even more disastrous and hypocritical, senator lindsey graham just called on trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nations highest court. 
all year long, republicans have been blocking president obamas nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court because they want the next president to make the pick. and because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. 
south carolina senator lindsey graham told wyff-tv that trump should pick texas senator ted cruz as the nominee and warned democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how republicans have treated president obamas nominee and threatened to block any nominees hillary clinton would have made had she won the election. 
im here to tell my democratic colleagues that i voted for obamas nominees. i expect them to give trumps nominees a fair shake. he won this election. he will pick a conservative. i would put ted cruz on that list. if they try to block this pick, they will regret it. if you dont honor trumps nominee, youre making a huge mistake. 
democrats should stand up and give graham a collective middle finger. 
since antonin scalia died in february, there has been a vacancy on the supreme court bench that has yet to be filled. the body wasnt even cold yet before republicans vowed to block any nominee president obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny garland a confirmation hearing. thats far from the fair shake graham is asking democrats to give to a man as dangerous as ted cruz. 
putting cruz on the supreme court would guarantee rulings against womens rights and lgbt rights as well as putting laws like the voting rights act and the civil rights act in further peril. in no uncertain terms should democrats grant cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of trumps conservative choices for the court. republicans should have thought about fair shakes before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the supreme court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than trump. again, senate republicans didnt even give garland a hearing or a vote. they refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards president obama. and so thats exactly what democrats should do to trump. turnabout is fair play and republicans only have themselves to blame.

on august 27, 2015, an email from lanny davis, special counsel to president bill clinton, and spokesperson for the president and the white house on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues, appears to suggest that both fox news and megyn kelly were part of the campaigns pre-coordination with journalists. davis tells jen palmieri the following personal thoughts, which suggest getting a guarantee from megyn kelly that she wont be tough on hillary  in a proposed interview  which could be a ratings and media bonanza  meant to explain why hillary wiped her server.
dear jen,
i know what im about to propose is very risky and will be instinctively viewed negatively on the first reaction. but because of the high advantages that i see, perfectly aware of the risks, i think this proposal should be considered.
i propose that the secretary be on the megyn kelly file show for at least 30 minutes. i believe i can reduce the risks, since i know megyn and roger ailes very well, by ensuring that the secretary will have an opportunity to answer tough questions on emails and other issues without interruption. 
in fact , i believe it is in the interest of secretary clinton as well as fox for the questions to be tough , something we should not fear as long as she has an opportunity to answer. i know she will do well with adequate preparation, and especially after yesterdays excellent statement taking full responsibility for mixing personal an official business on a single email device.
i still believe the issue of the wiping out of uthe private server still needs to be dealt with  e.g., simply stating that was done primarily to protect personal privacy on personal emails but she made the mistake of mixing personal with official on the server because she was using a single device, and she should have been more transparent shortly after she left office. 
this interview has the potential to be a ratings and media bonanza. i have confidence she would hit a political home run and have a massive audience to deliver her message without a filter. 
of course there is a risk that megan will try to show how tough she can be, even tougher than on trump. i am assuming the worst case on that risk. but if we have a guarantee, which i believe we will get, that she will have an uninterrupted chance to respond to every question, and we have time to prepare, i think this could be a major plus and even a game changer in the various negative narratives about the secretary being largely inaccessible and sometimes testy with the media. 
it would be so much better to be able to talk to you on the phone about this and discuss the pros and cons. if you are willing and available, what would be the best time in the best telephone number?
with warmest regards, and thanks as always for your consideration of my ideas,
lanny

he follows up four days later with the following
would love a chance to talk on phone  a few additional background points re conversation i had with roger ailes and megyn some time ago on the subject of hrc pre  announcement.

"mystery death of putins ex-adviser in dc was accident, say us authorities mystery death of putins ex-adviser in dc was accident, say us authorities   intel news 
the mysterious death in washington, dc, of a former senior adviser to russian president vladimir putin, who had fallen out with the russian president, was the result of an accident, us authorities have concluded after a year-long investigation. the body of mikhail yuriyevich lesin, a well-known russian media mogul, was found in the luxury dupont circle hotel on november 5, 2015. according to reports, his body bore considerable injuries on his torso and limbs. some unconfirmed updates suggested that lesin had died from several blunt force injuries to the head. but united states authorities refused to speculate on the cause of lesins death and opened an official investigation into the matter. 
lesin became famous in russia soon after the collapse of the communist system, when he founded video international, an advertising and public-relations agency that was hired by russian president boris yeltsin in 1995 to run his reelection campaign. yeltsins electoral success was partly attributed to the well-tailored media message projected by lesins company. the media magnate was rewarded by yeltsin, who offered him influential government posts, including that of director of russias state-owned news agency novosti. meanwhile, lesin became a media personality and frequently gave interviews espousing a free-enterprise model for the russian media industry. but soon after vladimir putins ascendance to the presidency, lesin saw the writing on the wall and began advocating for increased government regulation of media and telecommunications conglomerates. in 1999, putin made him minister of press, broadcasting and mass communications, a post he held for nearly six years, until 2004. in 2006, lesin was awarded the order for merit to the fatherland, one of the most prestigious civilian decorations in russia. 
but in late 2009, putin abruptly fired lesin from his post in the kremlins media advisory commission, allegedly because the media mogul had developed close contacts with russian organized crime. lesins ties with putins inner circle were further strained in 2014, when he resigned from his position as head of gazprom media, after he clashed with pro-putin executives on the board. last november, when lesins body was found in his hotel room by a member of the staff, some suggested that he may have been killed by the kremlin. but on friday, the metropolitan police department of washington, dc, in cooperation with the us attorneys office for the district of columbia, said that lesins death had been the result of injuries induced by falls, which came after days of excessive consumption of alcohol. the two agencies said that the federal bureau of investigation, which had assisted in the investigation into lesins death, concurred with the results. consequently, the investigation is now closed, they said. the kremlin, the russian embassy in washington, and the fbi, have not commented on the case. share this article...",26,736268,fake

in the letter , the economists listed a dozen economic policy reasons why voters should not vote for trump, but it as their conclusion that was stunning, he promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.donald trump is a dangerous, destructive choice for the country. he misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality. if elected, he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of the country. for these reasons, we strongly recommend that you do not vote for donald trump. 
trumps thoughts on the economy are dangerous to the prosperity of the country. it isnt just that trump is a person of bad character who lacks any of the human traits that voters should seek in a president. it is also that his policies are nonsense.

"чиновники предлагают ввести в россии пособие по бедности. а другие - убрать? 0 комментариев 1 поделились источник pravda.ru 
как рассказала первый замминистра финансов татьяна нестеренко, сейчас финансовая поддержка больше всего необходима семьям с детьми в возрасте до 16 лет, особенно в ней нуждаются ""семьи с двумя и более детьми и одним работающим родителем"". 
""сегодня было бы правильно и нам перейти на применение принципа нуждаемости при назначении отдельных социальных выплат и обсудить возможность введения нового вида пособия - пособия по бедности"", - добавила нестеренко. 
по словам чиновницы, прежде чем вводить новый вид пособий, сперва стоит определить понятие ""нуждаемость"" и его критерии на законодательном уровне. 
предложения министерства не отражены в проекте бюджета на 2017-2019 годы, добавила нестеренко. 
ранее председатель правительства рф дмитрий медведев подписал постановление о снижении величины прожиточного минимума. 
как пояснил правде.ру член комитета совета федерации по экономической политике николай власенко, ""это стоит воспринимать как техническую вещь. есть правила определения прожиточного минимума. они ежеквартально корректируются. в третьем квартале он был несколько завышен из-за инфляции, которая у нас носит сезонный характер. одновременно, например, снижение покупательского спроса, запускает дефляционные процессы. у нас сейчас специфическая ситуация в экономике - называется биполярная инфляция и дефляция "". 
по мнению эксперта правды.ру, в некоторых секторах инфляция идет опережающими темпами, а в каких-то есть даже дефляция. получилось, что в четвертом квартале по тем товарным группам, по которым идентифицируется прожиточный минимум, произошло снижение. во многом из-за того, что в третьем квартале был существенный рост. эксперт напомнил, что прожиточный минимум - техническая цифра, к которой ""привязаны"" размеры социальных пособий, субсидий на жкх и многое другое. но самое важное - это социально-демографический ориентир, порог бедности. 
правда.ру ранее писала, что поступало предложение ввести продовольственные карточки для бедных россиян. 
отметим, что использование продуктовых карточек для поддержки малообеспеченных людей является довольно распространенной в мире практикой, к примеру, в сша активно применяется система food stamp. на сегодняшний день около 21 американцев подают заявки на получение ежемесячных социальных пособий. 
кстати, ранее с предложением ввести продовольственные карточки в россии выступала фас. доктор экономических наук, профессор владимир мантусов в интервью правда.ру сообщил, что введение продуктовых талонов не вызовет никакой паники среди населения, так как это является обычной мерой социальной поддержки. однако, отметил эксперт, основной целью должно быть истребление бедности и нищеты в стране для того, чтобы люди не нуждались в бесплатных продуктах.

your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act, which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election. through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
the double standard established by your actions is clear. 
in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump, his top advisors, and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states, which trump praises at every opportunity. the public has a right to know this information. i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. there is no danger to american interests from releasing it. and yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. 
by contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. 
moreover, in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department. you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton. 
as you know, a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march 10, 2016, makes clear that all justice department employees, including you, are subject to the hatch act. the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the hatch act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. 
the clear double-standard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. 
please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past. when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant. 
with the deepest regret, i now see that i was wrong. 
sincerely, 
senator harry reid 
reid basically accused comey of violating the hatch act by releasing his letter so close to a presidential election. even though harry reid is retiring, the bad news for comey is that reids letter is a clear sign that senate democrats arent going to let this matter drop.

"the first space photo of earth - shot from a third reich rocket in 1946 previous - next  the first space photo of earth - shot from a third reich rocket in 1946 
prior to 1946, the highest pictures that had ever been taken of the earth were from the explorer ii balloon in 1935. at 13.7 miles up, the photos were understandably vague. at this point, our view of earth was largely based on science, with a bit of support from the explorer ii photos. however, nothing was clear enough to be confirmed. 
in october of 1946, the ideas of many scientists were confirmed, as new heights were reached. something astonishing occurred at white sands missile range in new mexico. using a v2 rocket that had been captured from nazis and brought to white sands in 300 rail cars after the war, a camera was shot into space. the first rocket reached what is now a measly height of 65 miles. at nearly five times the height of previous photos, researchers now had their first view from space. while the camera was destroyed, plummeting back to earth at nearly 500 feet per second, the film had been protected by a steel case, completely untouched . 
fred rulli recalls after the recovery of the film, when they first projected them onto the screen, the scientists just went nuts, speaking of the photos in 1946. he speaks of his friend, who realized the importance of the day, saying do you realize whats going on here? many may not have. they had no idea that in the years following that spectacular day, the v2 rockets would reach even greater heights, traveling over 100 miles up. hundreds of photos were taken and researchers were ecstatic at what they had discovered. 
today, when millions of people watch pictures of the earth from cameras in outer space every day, it seems a perfectly natural thing. since the v2 rockets, photos have been taken from the moon during the apollo 8 mission, from space beyond neptune in 1990 from the voyager 1, and more recently from nasas lunar reconnaissance orbiter. it seems as though there is not much left to discover when it comes to the surface of the earth and the photos we have captured of it. however, there will always be something greater. there will always be something new to be found, always a new way to capture beautiful, more technological photos of the surface of our earth.

"comment on 4 reasons why your diet sucks by the most important concepts the manosphere taught me home this month popular 4 reasons why your diet sucks 4 reasons why your diet sucks march 2, 2013 19 comments body 
1. you have no idea how much you are eating. 
ever wonder why you cant gain any muscle or lose any body fat? well, the first place to look for the answer is your diet. are you eating the requisite amount of calories for your goals? if you want to gain muscle you have to eat more calories than you burn, whereas if you want to lose body fat you have to eat fewer calories than you burn. there is no way around this simple fact. even though this is nothing more than a grade school physics problem, im still baffled by the number of guys out there whining about being hardgainers or endomorphs. invest in a food scale and track your intake. its really not that hard. 
2. you are constantly looking for the next best supplement to take. 
this is the game equivalent of asking for the one magic pick up line that will allow you to swoop top shelf girls left and right. the hard truth is that the vast majority of supplements are a complete waste of money. guys flock to supplements because its an easy fix. instead of putting in the time and hard work needed to obtain the results they desire, they look for shortcuts in order to get ahead. unfortunately, these shortcuts dont exist. the only time you should be worrying about supplements is when you have all of the other nutritional building blocks in place. 
3. you think you dont have the time to eat healthy. 
a lot of guys complain about being too busy to eat nutritious meals made mostly of whole foods. guys will also complain about not having enough time to hit the gym after work or during their lunch break. the problem here is not one of time , but rather of priorities . guys would rather sleep-in than get up early to make themselves a good lunch to take to work. the bottom line is this if you value your health then find the time to make yourself nutritious meals. ditch the excuses. 
4. you think there is one best diet for everyone 
ive been in this game long enough to know that there is no one particular diet that is best for everyone. i remember about 10 years ago people were losing their minds over the atkins diet. about 5 years later people moved on to the paleo diet, and now intermittent fasting is all the rage. new diets will always be on the horizon, which pretty much guarantees that arguments on the internet about which diet is the best will never end. i do not know what the best diet is. what i do know is that all good diets have several things in common such as being based around whole foods, and acknowledging the importance of portion control, protein, fiber, and other important nutrients. aside from these basics, whether you eat low carb or high carb, three meals a day or six meal, is entirely up to you and your lifestyle but make sure you get the basics down first. 
if you can get a handle on just these four areas of your nutrition you will be ahead of the vast majority of individuals out there.",151,736264,fake

"trump supporters booby trap polling place and spill blood of election volunteer video  addicting info  the knowledge you crave on november 3, 2016 1222 am  
donald trumps deplorable supporters arent waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
theyve been threatening bloody violence ever since trump began claiming that the election is rigged in favor of hillary clinton. and trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
in texas last week, a trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of trumps stupid hats and a deplorables t-shirt to vote. 
election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
of course, trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules dont apply to them. 
well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
at collin college in plano, texas a trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
but when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. the blades sliced into the volunteers hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
it just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody whos probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other, local democratic party campaign chair steve spainhouer said in response . i think most people have already made their minds up at this point how theyre going to vote and so theres nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful. 
heres the video via ktvt . 
frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. trumps supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as election day approaches. and if trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. but you wont hear donald trump condemning this act of violence. after all, he is the one inciting it.

last week, we found a presidential race where hillary clinton held a clear advantage. this week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. trump appears to be holding strong in his must-win states and colorado remains within the margin of error. the data also show that pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. 
the presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. hillary maintains an advantage leading in colorado and pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen, said titus bond, director of remington research group 
other state polling data came out on sunday that also showed a close-race between trump and clinton, although the polls were surveyed before fbi director james comey's announcement that they were re-opening their investigation against clinton . via realclearpolitics  florida new york timessiena trump 46 percent, clinton 42 percent. nbcwall street journalmarist clinton 45 percent, trump 44 percent. gravis clinton 48 percent, trump 47 percent. colorado cbs newsyougov clinton 42 percent, trump 39 percent. arizona cbsyougov trump 44 percent, clinton 42 percent. north carolina nbcwall street journalmarist clinton 47 percent, trump 41 percent. gravis clinton 49 percent, trump 47 percent. cbs newsyougov clinton 48 percent, trump 45 percent. pennsylvania cbs newsyougov clinton 48 percent, trump 40 percent. 
the fact that some of these polls were close even before the comey announcement led to this observation from fivethirtyeight's nate silver both things can be true 1 comey impact overblown  nate silver natesilver538 october 31, 2016 
radio host steve deace writes at conservative review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of clinton, the renewed fbi investigation could ""have a potentially huge impact"" on election day 
trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like arizona, georgia, utah, indiana, and alaska that rarely go blue on election day. its quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the clintons could sway the bulk of republican-leaning undecideds trumps way. but thats provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as hes been prone to do. then theres the matter of trumps emerging evan mcmullin headache in utah. 
if trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on iowa, nevada, florida, ohio, and north carolina. those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 electoral college votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in colorado, pennsylvania, or new mexico where trump is visiting during the campaigns final week. the hope is that theres enough voters in those states wearier of clintons corruption than worried about whether trumps fit for office. 
fivethirtyeight currently has trump's odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their polls-plus forecast. this week will be crucial for trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the fbi's re-opened investigation into clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to election day. tags",43,736268,real
"hillary clinton shuts down protester and trumps divisive vision at florida rally by hrafnkell haraldsson on wed, nov 2nd, 2016 at 902 am you know, i am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support donald trump."" share on twitter print this post 
speaking at reverend samuel delevoe memorial park in fort lauderdale, tuesday night, hillary clinton was interrupted by a donald trump supporter who shouted bill clinton is a rapist! he was no doubt working for the 5,000 reward offered by infowars. but clinton was having none of it. rather than ignoring the man, she issued a stern rebuke. stabbing her finger at the man, she said 
you know, i am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support donald trump. 
the man continued to shout, waving his sign, and the crowd countered with cries of hillary! hillary! as she said, 
it is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, were going forward into a brighter future. 
the protester was escorted out by security, and clinton told the man, and everyone like him, you may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan. dont be used. dont be exploited. 
see the protesters antics here. note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by clinton supporters 
sadly, all too many angry white christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by donald trump, who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the american dream, a man whom, as clinton says, has taken everything, and given nothing. 
last night, in florida, hillary clinton was taking nothing, and giving everything.

"ben shapiro destroys john oliver on abortion and trump  daily wire ben shapiro destroys john oliver on abortion and trump by hank berrien october 27, 2016 
on thursday, on his daily podcast, daily wire editor-in-chief ben shapiro decimated hbo host and supposed comedian john oliver for his comments regarding donald trump's comments on abortion during the third presidential debate. 
shapiro began, ""hbos john oliver belongs to a class of british people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent. they think that because they share an accent with rex harrison from my fair lady this makes them geniuses."" 
he continued 
so john oliver does a political show on american politics; he doesnt know much about american politics; he doesnt know much about politics generally; but hes been feted by the media because hes a comedian whos wildly to the left. so just like president obama is going to be interviewed by samantha bee, who is legitimately the least funny person in human history, she and trevor noah actually have a cage match next week to determine whos the least funny person in human history. both of them i believe, beat stalin for that title a while back, so now were going to unify the championships, so obamas going to be on with samantha bee, where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortions wonderful. 
john oliver was ripping on donald trump the other day at some awards ceremony, and because hes british, that means were supposed to pay attention to him, even though we fought a revolution so we wouldnt have to pay attention to the brits. heres john oliver talking about abortion 
the screen then showed oliver pontificating 
in terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important; we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of late-term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work, no clear understanding of the basic biology of womens bodies, and a very poor sense of grammar as well. so i guess we got, in a sense, what we were asking for. if you ask donald trump to draw a fallopian tube, i cannot imagine what you would get back other than a childs drawing of a cobra. 
shapiro fired back 
okay. i would hesitate to ask john oliver to draw a fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here, because he obviously doesnt know. now look, i criticized trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasnt graphic enough. but let me, for those who missed it, explain what exactly happens in a late-term abortion, which is what he was talking about, okay? what happens in a late-term abortion, what happens in a late-term abortion, is something completely awful; this is according to americanpregnancy.org., okay? not a right-wing pro-life website americanpregnancy.org ""the fetus is rotated; forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs, shoulders and arms through the birth canal. a small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside. the catheter removes the cerebral material, that would be the brains, until the skull collapses. the fetus is then completely removed. 
shapiro continued to explain the barbaric procedure 
okay, thats one procedure thats used; thats dilation and extraction. in late-term abortions it usually one of these two; dilation and evacuation or dilation and extraction. dilation and evacuation the baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it; sometimes they dont use such injections; then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the childs body in the womb, and remove it piece by piece. 
then he proceeded to carve up oliver 
so i guess that donald trump could have been more graphic; i dont know that john oliver would have enjoyed that, but he could have been more graphic, i suppose. but this is what they do, laugh it up, oh, he cant draw a fallopian tube."" 
okay, john draw an abortion. really. draw it; lets see it. i want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and i want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. its not waving a magic wand, and its not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing. i want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb. i would like to see that. ""okay, john draw an abortion. really. draw it; lets see it. i want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and i want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like."" ben shapiro 
shapiro concluded 
but of course hell never do that, other than, ""it might look like a cobra; it might look like a cobra; maybe itll look like a princess, waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina. the fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to child-killing is absolutely ridiculous and despicable.

"it turns out trump put off investigators for 6 months while he destroyed emails by hrafnkell haraldsson on mon, oct 31st, 2016 at 1220 pm trump refused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. said under oath was destroying them whole time. share on twitter print this post 
newsweek s kurt eichenwald has struck again, reporting that donald trump refused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. said under oath was destroying them whole time. 
the whole strategy, he writes at newsweek in an article he swears was written before comeys announcement, was deny, impede and delay, while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over. 
in 1973, he reveals, the republican nominee, his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to african-americans. 
shortly after the government filed its case in october, trump attacked he falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities, but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldnt pay their rent.the familys attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical. trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any formal communications with him; he contended that hed learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning. but trumps sworn statement was a lie. court records show that the government had filed its complaint at 10 a.m. and phoned him almost immediately afterward. the government later notified the media with a press release.  six months after the original filing, the case was nowhere because the trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions, known as interrogatories.finally, under subpoena, trump appeared for a short deposition. when asked about the missing documents, he made a shocking admission the trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no document-retention program. they had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case. instead, in order to save space, trump testified, officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage. 
so trump can accuse hillary clinton of destroying emails  and he does, nearly every day  but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard. 
with false affidavits and deny and delay strategies, writes eichenwald, trump  his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court. 
donald trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics, projecting his own guilt onto others. his foundation in trouble? point the finger at the clinton foundation. sexual assault allegations? point the finger at bill and hillary clinton. 
once again, kurt eichenwald has dug into donald trumps deplorable past and revealed the real donald trump. its not pretty. and each revelation from eichenwald and david fahrenthold shows trump to be an even worse human being than the last. 
it is no wonder his deplorables love him so much.

a trump supporter sporting a hillary for prison t-shirt chanted jews s-a in support of his candidate during a rally in arizona on saturday. 
the target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for trumps rhetoric at every rally. 
the context while the crowd was chanting usa one man chanted jews s-a. words like that cant be spun or read into. the intent and meaning were obvious to everyone. 
watch here on video obtained by the huffington post . 
this sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that donald trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction. it may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which trump has shown contempt, but it is not. 
muslims, jews, immigrants, labor, taxpayers, latinos, hispanics, mexicans, african-americans, women, pows, veterans, people with disabilities, gold star families, and the military have felt the sting of trumps words and the disdain in his heart. 
throughout this campaign season, the vitriol against hillary clinton saw no limit. signs and t-shirts too disgusting to quote in this article. chants of lock her up at the republican convention and since. trump promised his base of thugs, lowlifes, and haters he would weaken the first amendment, strengthen the second and establish the alt-right utopia. 
hillary clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race. she also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed. not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar, she was competing for who we are and who we could be. for all the trump claims that the media is rigged in clintons favor, it was trump who got free advertising, who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary news stories of the campaign. 
there is no doubt that hillary clinton will keep her promise to fight for us. she has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign. every time hillary clinton called out donald trumps sexist comments, she was fighting for all women who were attacked, humiliated and sexually abused by men like trump. every time clinton shamed trumps horrific and disgusting comments about the khan family she was standing up for every gold star family. she was also standing up for every muslim-american. the same is true every time clinton condemned trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to alt-right stereotypes about african-americans, inner-cities, and african-american communities. 
every time trump spewed hate in whatever direction, hillary clinton defended the target. 
so no, this isnt about choosing the lesser of two evils. like every election, this is about choosing our next president. more importantly, its about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be.

im just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump, right? trump asked the crowd. what are we even having it for?  her policies are so bad. 
despite trumps plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls, it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies  thankfully. 
the remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which trump claimed the process is rigged against him, and he will only accept the outcome of the election if its favorable for him. 
but trump wasnt done at his buckeye state rally. he also made sure to take a dig at minority communities.

the republican nominees ghetto comment is the newest addition to what is the standard trump narrative that black communities are hellscapes. this particular set of remarks comes a day after he visited north carolina for a rally and told supporters  mostly white  that he would enact a new deal for black america.

public backlash against trade deals like president barack obamas tran-pacific partnership  a deal that clinton once called the gold standard in trade agreements was so fierce that clinton changed her tune during the democratic primary where she was defeated by vermont sen. bernie sanders.

hard working americans will be voting for change in november because they feel like the system is rigged against them, and they know that clinton and her cohorts are the ones rigging it, lineberger added.

"fox news calls for special prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat, oct 29th, 2016 at 756 am ""if she gets elected on november 8th, this isn't going away. so what needs to happen, special prosecutor? she can't investigate herself as the president-elect""   
president barack obama did not have to do anything wrong for republicans to want to throw him in jail, or to impeach him. hillary clinton doesnt have to have done anything wrong either, apparently, for congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected  because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her . 
at least, that and completely ignoring the facts, was the theme on fox news last night, though to be fair, other mainstream media outlets werent much better yesterday. 
megyn kelly, fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a face-off with newt gingrich, suggested to chairman of the house judiciary committee bob goodlatte r-wv that given the fbi revelations of a complete lack of evidence that hillary clinton has done anything wrong, what needs to happen is a special prosecutor. 
megyn kelly  let me ask you this. if she gets elected on november 8th, this isnt going away. so what needs to happen, a special prosecutor? she cant investigate herself as the president-elect. bob goodlatte  well, first of all, we have said from the outset that the house judiciary committee would follow the truth wherever it leads, and we have done that throughout the summer, asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the fbi was being conducted. we will continue to do that. we dont know whats going to happen now. we dont know whats going to happen after the election. so its pure speculation what will happen afterwards. a special prosecutor, remember, is appointed by the attorney general of the united states. so, you have to decide whether thats going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the fbi under the direction of director comey right now. and the judiciary committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation. 
democracy is a fragile thing. it is to goodlattes credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in 2014 and that he cautioned megyn kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the house but by the attorney general. however, the gop-led house has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy. 
what holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works. republicans have decided it only works if theyre in charge, and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries, appoint special prosecutors if they win, or vote to impeach them outright, as trumps pet snake at cnn, jeffrey lord, called for last night  
two points, anderson. one, with 11 days left, this makes donald trumps argument exactly to the point here, you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment, her paranoia and all of the rest. the second thing, anderson is, and this is the really disturbing thing, lets just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election, this isnt going to stop. there will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that bible. this is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly, i mean thats something the american people need to consider now. 
it is not difficult to see where this will lead. hillary clinton has committed no crimes. far from being a miscarriage of justice, though it is that as well, this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity. 
this sort of talk is just further evidence that donald trump comes from the same vile brew as paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and the rest of the party. during the mccarthy era, the house took it upon itself to be both judge and jury. last night, it was fox news egging the house on for more of the same.

this comes as welcome news for republicans. obamas policy unpopularity  and his tendency to lecture from on high to americans in rural areas  means that hell suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing trump and republicans. middle americans voted for trump in order to sound off against obamas obvious scorn for them. heres what obama had to say about those who didnt vote for trump in todays der spiegel  
if you look at the new generation of americans, they reflect the vision that i spoke about. they're diverse. they believe in tolerance. they're accepting of things like same-sex marriage. they believe in integration. the problem, though, is that young people are less likely to vote than older people. what results is a situation in which sometimes the elections don't fully reflect the views of the american population. essentially, the president-elect was supported by about 27 percent of the american population. one of our challenges, historically, is that we have very low voting rates, even during presidential elections. 
this sort of language drove americans to trump. and if obama continues to critique trump from the outside with this sort of language, not only will he be doing trump a favor, hell be preventing any other democrat from taking a leading role in opposing trump. hell become the point of resistance for his own party  and his party wont be able to escape his shadow.

"yemens seventh truce turning tragedy into farce  new eastern outlook country yemen with six previous attempts to observe truce having already failed to mitigate the intensity of the crisis, the us brokered seventh truce has yet again and unsurprisingly failed to end the fighting in yemen where the death toll has already risen to 7,000. despite the fact that both rebels and the yemeni government had agreed to observe the truce and the ceasefire announced by the saudia led coalition, fighting has surged, with both sides accusing each other of violation, around the flashpoint southwestern city of taez, where violence has killed dozens this week, despite clashes subsiding on several fronts. while the fighting itself is a clear reflection of the us inability to control the situation on the ground even in a limited sense, the irony of the matter is thatand what turns the tragedy into farcethe us, which is trying to broker peace, happens to be the biggest provider of weapons to saudi arabia which has been bombing yemen for last 19 months. this is where the crux of the problem lies and this is where the original cause of the war must be traced back to. yemen war continues to drag on not because the warring parties are unable to come to terms; it continues to defy a negotiated end due primarily to the us dual-game in the regiona policy that utilises the war-scenario to not only to deepen the arab countries dependence upon the us for military assistance and aid but also to earn billions in terms of weapons sold to the same countries. therefore, john kerrys involvement in many rounds of talks notwithstanding, it is also a fact that many strikes are actually carried out by saudi pilots who have received their training by the us and who fly us-made jets that are refuelled in the air by american planes. and yemenis often find the remains of american-made munitions, as they did in the ruins after a strike that killed more than 100 mourners at a funeral last month. graffiti on walls across sana reads america is killing the yemeni people. to the us disappointment, no graffiti reads america is brokering peace in yemen, or that america, is protecting the yemenis from brutal bombing. with the us thus playing a double game in yemen and with the us-made missiles and jets pounding the yemenis indiscriminately, the question of the us being a committer of war crimes becomes pertinent. the allegation has concrete material base. for instance, consider this while the un officials were expressing their concerns over the rising toll of civilian deaths in yemen in september this year, the us senate backed, on september 21, the obama administrations plan to sell more than 1 billion worth of american-made tanks and other weapons to saudi arabia, soundly defeating a bid to derail the deal pushed by lawmakers critical of the kingdoms role in yemens war. the deal involves more than 100 main battle tanks, machine guns, smoke grenade launchers, night-vision devices, vehicles to recover damaged tanks from the battlefield, and thousands of rounds of training ammunition. the primary contractor for the equipment is general dynamics land systems of sterling heights, michigan. with saudi arabia being such an important buyer of the us made weapons, which are being currently used in yemen against the houthis, and with the us being eager to fulfil its security commitments and equally facilitating the saudi led coalitions bombing campaigns both logistically and militarily, peace cannot really be established, not unless the us forces saudia to stop its bombing campaignsomething that comes at a high-cost for the us weapon-makers hence, unlikely to happen. what adds insult to injury is that the supporters of the deal say that the us cannot deny its middle east allies the weapons they need to combat islamic state of iraq and syria isis extremists and check irans aggression in the region. blocking this sale of tanks will be interpreted by our gulf partners, not just saudi arabia, as another sign that the united states of america is abandoning our commitment to the region and is an unreliable security partner, said john mccain. the support continues despite the fact that the saudi-led coalition was responsible for 60 percent of the 2,067 civilians killed in the conflict over a yearlong span starting on july 1, 2015, according to a report released by u.n. human rights chief zeid raad al-hussein. given the dual game the us is playing in yemen, it cannot be gainsaid that truce and ceasefire cannot hold the fighting and pave the way for an end of the war, not unless saudi arabias source of military power, the us, decides to cut off the chain of supply and brings it to the negotiating tablesomething that is unlikely to happen under obama administration and something that would be paid lip service only under the trump administration. in this context, the off and on saga of truce and ceasefire means nothing except that it allows the us administration to feed the general public with the impression of maintaining a neutral stance towards the war. salman rafi sheikh, research-analyst of international relations and pakistans foreign and domestic affairs, exclusively for the online magazine  new eastern outlook . popular articles",98,736292,fake
